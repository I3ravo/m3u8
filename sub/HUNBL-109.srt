1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to make dinner.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'll talk to you a little more.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Do you want to talk?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to talk.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do you want to talk?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're always so sweet.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When I talk to you, I feel so calm.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Really?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, just a little more.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just a little more.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What are you going to make for dinner today?

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What do you want?

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Can I make omelette?

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your omelette is delicious, so it's okay.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's just omelette.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to eat fried eggs and rice.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You want to eat rice, too?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What do you want to eat?

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to eat vegetables, too.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You want to eat vegetables, too?

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you want to eat?

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to eat shoronpo.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I want to make a shoronpo.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please make it.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's make it together.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
While reading books.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's make it together.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Shoronpo is a condom.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I didn't buy any materials today.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's make it together.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait a minute.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's spend more time together.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Tsuyoshi, you haven't changed at all.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you a good boy?

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I love you.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I love you too.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tsuyoshi?

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Tsuyoshi?

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's morning.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come here.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you up?

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll be late. I have dinner.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Eat dinner.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Again?

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You always come home late, don't you?

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really?

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're so busy with work.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, it's cold.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You'll be late if you don't get ready soon.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm always alone at night, so I feel lonely.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I want to eat with you.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I think you'll get a job soon, so let's eat together.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll be late. Get ready.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Huh?

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Isn't that my sister?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought she was working at the same time.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey, sis?

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sis...

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Where is she going?

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,020
・

77
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,020
・

78
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,020
・

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,020
・

80
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,020
・

81
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm not sure if it's okay to see it.

82
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,020
It's cool.

83
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
It's noisy.

84
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,020
Is it okay to see it?

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
It's written.

86
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,020
What should I do?

87
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,020
After the operation, she is in a state of trance.

88
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,020
She is in a state of trance.

89
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,020
She is in a state of trance.

90
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,020
She is in a state of trance.

91
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,020
I can't do it anymore.

92
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,020
Really?

93
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
That's enough.

94
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,020
You are so cute.

95
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,020
You are so cute.

96
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:05,020
If I hadn't had sex with you, I would have been a normal girl.

97
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:14,020
I wouldn't have been able to have sex with you.

98
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
It's not good if you don't have a tail.

99
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Ah!

100
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Ah!

101
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Ah!

102
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
Ah!

103
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Ah!

104
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Ah!

105
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
Ah!

106
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,020
Ah!

107
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,020
I have a bad feeling.

108
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
I am afraid.

109
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,020
I have a very bad feeling.

110
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
I have a very bad feeling.

111
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,020
Why are you crying?

112
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,020
I am scared.

113
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
I am scared.

114
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
I am scared.

115
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
I am scared.

116
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
I am scared.

117
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Can you feel my pain?

118
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,020
I am scared.

119
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
I am scared.

120
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
I am scared.

121
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,020
Are you okay?

122
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Are you okay?

123
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,020
It's okay, it's okay.

124
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,020
What are you doing, Rin-chan?

125
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,680
I...

126
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,420
Onee-chan.

127
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,040
What are you doing?

128
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,020
Higashante.

129
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Hey, Neneko, wake up.

130
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Wake up.

131
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Neneko.

132
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,020
Neneko.

133
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,020
What are you doing?

134
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Who are you?

135
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
What are you doing?

136
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Who are you?

137
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,020
What are you doing?

138
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,020
I'm going home.

139
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Is he your younger brother?

140
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,020
Is he your younger brother?

141
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
He knows you well.

142
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Take him home.

143
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Sigh.

144
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
Sigh.

145
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,020
Sigh.

146
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
No no no, it's fine.

147
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Sigh.

148
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Sigh.

149
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Sigh.

150
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
Sigh.

151
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Sigh.

152
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Sigh.

153
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Sigh.

154
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
That's fine.

155
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
Yes.

156
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Sigh.

157
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Sigh.

158
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Miya-chan.

159
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Miya-chan, stop it.

160
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Stop it.

161
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
You're not going to stop.

162
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Hey.

163
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Miya-chan.

164
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Stop it.

165
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Miya-chan.

166
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
You're so pretty.

167
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Stop it, Miya-chan.

168
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
No, don't do that.

169
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
You'll get hurt.

170
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Are you really going to do it?

171
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
I'm going to hit you.

172
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
No, don't do that.

173
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
No, don't do that.

174
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
No, don't do that.

175
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
No, don't do that.

176
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
No, don't do that.

177
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
She's coming out.

178
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
She's coming out.

179
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
No, don't do that.

180
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Don't do that.

181
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Don't do it.

182
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
It's hard.

183
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Stop it.

184
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
You'll feel it when you're hit.

185
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
Give it a few shots.

186
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Oh, no.

187
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Hey, hey, hey.

188
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Oh, no.

189
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
Oh, no.

190
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
Oh, no.

191
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,020
Hey, hey, hey.

192
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Oh, no.

193
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
Come on!

194
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
Ah!

195
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Ah!

196
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
Uh!

197
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
Ah!

198
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
Ah!

199
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,020
Ah!

200
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Ah!

201
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,020
Uh!

202
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
Uh!

203
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,020
Oh!

204
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Oh!

205
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Oh!

206
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
Ah!

207
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
Oh, no!

208
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
Oh!

209
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Ouch!

210
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Ouch!

211
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
It's okay, it's okay.

212
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
What's wrong, Sato?

213
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Hmm?

214
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Well, you know...

215
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Clouds are slowly falling down.

216
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
When I see them,

217
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
I feel so calm.

218
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
That's true.

219
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
When I look at them.

220
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
It's nice, isn't it?

221
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
My heart feels so calm.

222
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,420
That's all.

223
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,920
You feel so calm, too, don't you?

224
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
It's annoying, isn't it?

225
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
You don't have to do that.

226
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
I have to cook.

227
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Let's talk a little more.

228
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Let's talk a little more.

229
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
I have to cook.

230
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
You want to eat rice, don't you?

231
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Then...

232
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Can you give me a little massage?

233
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
You don't have to do that.

234
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Sure.

235
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
Come here.

236
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
I won.

237
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
You're the tallest, aren't you?

238
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Huh?

239
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
You're the tallest.

240
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
I mean,

241
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,920
I like you.

242
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
I like you the most.

243
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
No,

244
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
I like you more.

245
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
What?

246
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
I won't lose.

247
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Yes.

248
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Good boy.

249
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
You did well today.

250
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
You must be tired.

251
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Let's take a break.

252
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
I'm still cooking.

253
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Really?

254
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,920
My mom and I are late for work.

255
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
I know.

256
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
She'll be back soon.

257
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Right?

258
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Yes.

259
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Just a little more.

260
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
It can't be helped.

261
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,920
I wish I could have a peaceful day like this forever.

262
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
That's right.

263
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
That's right.

264
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Taka-kun, wake up.

265
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,920
It's morning.

266
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Good morning.

267
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
I have to go out.

268
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Wake up.

269
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Eat breakfast.

270
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Thank you.

271
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,920
I'm going to work late tonight.

272
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,920
I'll cook dinner for you, so eat it.

273
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
I have a part-time job today, too?

274
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Yeah.

275
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
I have to go now.

276
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,920
But I had a part-time job yesterday, too.

277
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,920
I have a lot of part-time jobs, so I'll go.

278
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
See you.

279
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
I'll get up soon.

280
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Hey, sis.

281
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I'm going. See you.

282
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Wait a minute, sis.

283
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Let's leave her alone.

284
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
She's been busy lately.

285
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,920
I'm not a good person at all.

286
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Sister?

287
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,920
I don't think it's the right way to work.

288
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,920
I'm going to take a walk in front of the station.

289
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,920
What's on the 8th floor?

290
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,920
It's different from the white site here.

291
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
What the hell am I doing?

292
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
What?

293
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
What is this place?

294
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

295
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,860
I want to go home.

296
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm tired.

297
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,860
I'm tired.

298
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I want to go home.

299
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
I want to go home.

300
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
I want to go home.

301
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,960
I was so scared.

302
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,960
I'm sorry.

303
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,960
I'm sorry.

304
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,960
I'm sorry.

305
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,960
I'm sorry.

306
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,960
I'm sorry.

307
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,960
I'm sorry.

308
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,960
I'm sorry that I have no voice.

309
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,960
I'll keep singing and dancing.

310
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,960
I'm sorry that I have no voice.

311
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,960
I'll keep singing and dancing.

312
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,960
I'm sorry that I have no voice.

313
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,840
It's not like that.

314
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,880
I don't think so.

315
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
It looks like this.

316
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Hey, hey.

317
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,880
What are you doing?

318
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Hey, hey.

319
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Hey!

320
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,080
Hey, hey.

321
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,080
Go home.

322
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
No, no.

323
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,080
Hey, hey.

324
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,080
I'm sorry.

325
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,080
What do you want me to do?

326
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,080
This is the only way to think.

327
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Hey, sis.

328
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,080
Hey, sis.

329
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Hey, sis.

330
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,080
You want this, right?

331
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
Sis.

332
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,080
Come on, come on.

333
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,080
Hey, it's me.

334
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,080
Sis.

335
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,080
Hey.

336
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,080
Sis.

337
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
Hey, sis.

338
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,080
I won't move.

339
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,080
If you want, you can do it by yourself.

340
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,080
Hey, hey.

341
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,080
Hey, hey.

342
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,080
Hey, hey.

343
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,080
Hey, hey.

344
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,080
Hey, hey.

345
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,080
Hey, hey.

346
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Hey, hey.

347
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
Hey, hey.

348
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Hey, hey.

349
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
Hey, hey.

350
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Hey, hey.

351
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,080
No, no, no.

352
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,080
Calm down, calm down.

353
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,080
Calm down.

354
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
I'm looking forward to it.

355
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,080
You can do whatever you want.

356
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,080
I don't know what to do.

357
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Don't shout.

358
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,080
Be quiet!

359
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,080
Let's go home.

360
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,080
Let's go home.

361
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:47,080
Let's get up and go home.

362
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,080
What are you doing?

363
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,080
Are you serious?

364
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,080
I told you not to do that.

365
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:59,080
I told you not to do that.

366
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,660
Wait, wait, wait.

367
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,960
I don't know.

368
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
I don't know.

369
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,500
I don't know.

370
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,840
I'll...

371
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,840
I'll take care of it.

372
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

373
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,840
I can't take it anymore.

374
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
I'm sorry.

375
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
I'm sorry.

376
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
I'm sorry.

377
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,840
I can't take it anymore.

378
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
I can't take it anymore.

379
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,840
No!

380
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
I can't do it!

381
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,840
I can't do it!

382
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,840
It's delicious.

383
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,840
It's delicious.

384
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
It's delicious.

385
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,840
It's delicious.

386
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,840
I don't want to die...

387
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,840
Is he new?

388
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
No.

389
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
He's younger than me.

390
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
Seriously?

391
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
I'm going to touch him.

392
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Stop it.

393
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,840
This guy is dangerous.

394
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
He's going to fall.

395
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
He's a friend.

396
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,840
Big sis.

397
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,840
I'm not your big sister, but I'm your big brother.

398
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,840
We're brothers no matter what you do.

399
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,840
I'm looking for you, but I'm your big brother.

400
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,840
You can do it!

401
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,840
Are you going to bed soon?

402
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,840
I think I'll go if I stay a little longer.

403
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,840
Be careful.

404
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,840
I can't eat anymore.

405
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,840
Really?

406
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,840
I already ate.

407
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,840
You can't eat anymore.

408
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
I can't eat this much.

409
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,840
I can't wait anymore.

410
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Is your time okay?

411
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
It's still okay.

412
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,840
It's okay.

413
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,840
Oh, that's right.

414
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,840
Today too.

415
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,840
I'm full.

416
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,840
I'm hungry.

417
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,840
Oh, really?

418
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
Good luck.

419
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,840
Thank you.

420
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,840
What about dinner?

421
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
I don't need it.

422
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,840
Really?

423
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
Yeah.

424
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,840
Are you okay?

425
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Have you eaten?

426
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,840
Yeah.

427
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,840
You've been working hard lately.

428
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
Yeah.

429
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
You're not late for work.

430
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
Yeah.

431
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,840
That's what I'm sorry about.

432
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,840
Did you get a boyfriend?

433
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
What?

434
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,840
What are you talking about?

435
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
I can't get a boyfriend.

436
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
What?

437
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,840
I can't.

438
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,840
You're mean.

439
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,040
No, I mean, you know...

440
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,240
It costs a lot of money to buy clothes.

441
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,140
Yeah, that's right.

442
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,640
It's a waste of money.

443
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,140
You know, you've been wearing a lot of hair lately.

444
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,140
You're not really like that, are you?

445
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,240
What? No, I'm not.

446
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,840
You look so pretty.

447
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,140
You're not weird.

448
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,440
No, I'm not.

449
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,540
You really like me, don't you?

450
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,900
You don't need a boyfriend, do you?

451
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,540
What?

452
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,600
You don't need a boyfriend, do you?

453
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,100
I don't know.

454
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,540
What do you mean you don't know?

455
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,580
Why?

456
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,780
You really don't have one?

457
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,480
I'm pretty, aren't I?

458
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,880
I'm fashionable.

459
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,680
I see.

460
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,680
All the girls are fashionable.

461
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,020
You can be one of them.

462
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,820
Yeah.

463
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,260
You're so pretty.

464
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,960
You don't have to be more beautiful.

465
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,520
Even when you go to college,

466
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
There must be a lot of weirdos.

467
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,520
That's not true.

468
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,520
It's okay.

469
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,520
I'm not worried about my mom.

470
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,520
I really like you.

471
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,520
I'm a good old man.

472
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,520
I'm worried about you even though you're so cute.

473
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,520
I'm worried about my mom.

474
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,520
But it's okay.

475
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,520
Isn't that too much?

476
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,520
That's not true.

477
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,520
I don't want to be a loser.

478
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
Why?

479
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,520
I don't want to spend money.

480
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,520
I've been chosen by the last place.

481
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,520
Not a card?

482
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,520
I want to get a body line.

483
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,520
No, I don't want to show that.

484
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,520
You're too good.

485
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,520
I know, right?

486
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,520
Because...

487
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,520
I don't have a boyfriend.

488
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
Then, what about you?

489
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
I don't want a girlfriend.

490
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
You don't want me?

491
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,520
It's good to have you.

492
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,520
You really like me, don't you?

493
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Of course I do.

494
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,520
You're a good person.

495
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,520
You're right.

496
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,520
You don't have to have someone you like.

497
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,520
No, I don't.

498
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,520
Do you have someone you like?

499
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,520
I don't know.

500
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,520
I might be able to.

501
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,520
You're wearing glasses like you used to.

502
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Why did you wear contacts?

503
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,520
Your glasses were so cute.

504
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,520
I have to go now.

505
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,520
I have to go too.

506
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,520
I have to go.

507
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,520
I'll be free next Sunday.

508
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,520
Let's go together.

509
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,520
I'll go first.

510
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,520
See you later.

511
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,520
It looks so delicious.

512
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,520
Of course she likes you more than her siblings.

513
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,520
Maybe she thinks too much.

514
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,520
Why is he here?

515
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,520
Where is he going?

516
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,520
I'm hungry.

517
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,520
Open the door.

518
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Is he my boyfriend?

519
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,520
No, he's not.

520
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,520
No way.

521
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,520
I'm curious.

522
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,520
What is he doing?

523
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,520
I'll wait.

524
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,520
I wonder what he's doing in his stomach.

525
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,520
I'm curious.

526
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,520
I'm worried about her.

527
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,520
Se-chan...

528
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,520
Is she in there?

529
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,520
Are you okay?

530
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,520
I'm fine.

531
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,520
I'm fine.

532
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,520
I'm fine.

533
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
I'm fine.

534
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,520
I'm fine.

535
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,520
I'm fine.

536
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,520
I'm sorry.

537
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,520
Please stop.

538
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,520
I'm sorry.

539
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,520
I'm trying to do something.

540
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,520
I'm sorry.

541
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
I'm sorry.

542
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,520
Let's go back.

543
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,520
I'm sorry.

544
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,520
I'm sorry.

545
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,520
I'm sorry.

546
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,520
More.

547
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
It's hot.

548
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,520
It's hot.

549
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,520
It's hot.

550
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,520
It's hot.

551
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,520
It's hot.

552
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,520
You're not done yet.

553
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,020
Hey, come on.

554
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,420
I'm not done!

555
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,420
You're sweating.

556
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,420
I'm not done yet.

557
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,420
Are you okay?

558
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,420
I'm not done yet.

559
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,420
I'm not done yet.

560
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,420
I'm not done yet.

561
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,420
Are you okay?

562
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,420
I'm not done yet.

563
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,420
I'm not done yet.

564
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:13,420
What do you want?

565
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,420
I want to die!

566
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,420
I want to die!

567
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,420
She's laughing.

568
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,420
You can do it!

569
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,420
You can do it!

570
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,420
You can do it!

571
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,420
You're mad at me, aren't you?

572
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,420
It's cold.

573
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,420
What are you doing?

574
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,420
What?

575
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,420
Why are you touching yourself?

576
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,420
I'm sorry.

577
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,420
You are in trouble.

578
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,420
I'm sorry.

579
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:21,420
My legs are painful.

580
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,420
My legs are painful.

581
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,420
You are not in pain.

582
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,420
I'm sorry.

583
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,420
I'm sorry.

584
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,420
I'm sorry.

585
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,420
I'm sorry.

586
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,420
I'm sorry.

587
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,420
I'm sorry.

588
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,420
More! More!

589
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,420
Hurry! Hurry!

590
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,420
Are you OK?

591
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,420
More!

592
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:12,420
Do you want more?

593
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,420
You need to give me more.

594
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:18,420
Give me more.

595
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,420
Stop it.

596
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:30,420
Who are you?

597
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,420
Let's go home.

598
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,420
Are you okay?

599
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,420
Let me go.

600
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,420
You said sister.

601
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,420
Yes.

602
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,420
Sister.

603
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,420
Let me go.

604
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,420
You are younger than me.

605
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,420
Sister.

606
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,420
Look.

607
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,420
I got a new Chimpo.

608
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,420
What are you doing?

609
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,420
Look.

610
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,420
Chimpo.

611
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,420
Sister.

612
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,420
I'm Kota.

613
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:07,420
You're addicted to Chimpo, aren't you?

614
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:11,420
Stop it, sis.

615
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,420
I'm your little brother.

616
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,420
You're amazing.

617
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,420
Let go of me.

618
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,420
Sis.

619
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,420
She's licking him.

620
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,420
I don't know.

621
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,420
You're addicted to Chimpo.

622
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,420
You're addicted to everything.

623
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,420
I don't understand.

624
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,420
You're licking everyone, aren't you?

625
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:37,420
No, I'm not licking anyone.

626
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,420
I said I'm not licking anyone.

627
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,420
Why are you standing up?

628
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,420
You're not standing up, are you?

629
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,420
No, I'm not licking anyone.

630
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,420
Oh, that's right.

631
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,420
I'm licking everyone.

632
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:54,420
I'm licking everyone.

633
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,420
You're not licking anyone.

634
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,420
I'm licking everyone.

635
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:04,420
Chikkun, how is Chikkun?

636
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:06,420
It's delicious.

637
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:07,420
Is it delicious?

638
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,420
No, it's delicious.

639
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,420
It doesn't matter to anyone.

640
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:14,420
No, it doesn't matter to you.

641
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:18,420
Mom, if it's Chikkun, it doesn't matter, right?

642
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,420
It doesn't matter to me.

643
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,420
I know.

644
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,420
It doesn't matter to anyone.

645
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,420
No, it doesn't matter to you.

646
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,420
No, no, no.

647
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:31,420
More, more.

648
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,420
How is it?

649
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,420
You are moving.

650
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,420
I feel bad.

651
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,420
Look at her face.

652
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,420
She is in pain.

653
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,420
I feel bad.

654
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,420
I feel bad.

655
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,420
Do it again.

656
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,420
Come on, come on.

657
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,420
Stop it.

658
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,420
Stop it.

659
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,420
I'm still taking pictures.

660
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,420
Stop it.

661
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,420
Stop it.

662
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,420
Stop it.

663
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,420
Stop it.

664
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,420
Stop it.

665
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:21,420
Don't do that!

666
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,420
What?

667
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,420
What's wrong?

668
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,420
Ichi...

669
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,420
Ichi...

670
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,420
Ichi...

671
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,420
Ichi...

672
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,420
You're out of breath.

673
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,420
I'm so hungry

674
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,420
I want more

675
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,420
I want more

676
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,420
I want more

677
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,420
I'm so hungry

678
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:43,420
You're saying something cool, aren't you?

679
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:47,420
You're doing it while saying something cool, aren't you?

680
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,420
This is bad.

681
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,420
It feels good.

682
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:58,420
What is this?

683
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,420
What is this?

684
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,420
I'm sorry.

685
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,420
I'm sorry.

686
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:31,420
I'm sorry.

687
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,420
You're fine.

688
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,420
I'm sorry.

689
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:37,420
I didn't mean to do this.

690
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:09,420
I can't, I can't do this anymore.

691
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,420
I love you, Na-chan.

692
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,420
Let go of me...

693
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,420
I love you...

694
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,420
I love you...

695
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,420
I love you...

696
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,420
I love you...

697
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:12,420
I can't. I can't.

698
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:15,420
I can't. I can't.

699
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,420
Aki. Aki.

700
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,420
Wake up.

701
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:38,420
I'll be back at 11.

702
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,420
Come on, wake up.

703
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:43,420
Good morning, sis.

704
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:45,420
You're not awake.

705
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,420
Let me sleep a little longer.

706
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:49,420
I'm sleepy.

707
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,420
Why? I have to go out for a bit.

708
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,420
Where are you going?

709
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:56,420
I have some business to attend to.

710
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,420
What business?

711
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:01,420
I'm going to meet some friends.

712
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:03,420
I see.

713
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:07,420
You came home early.

714
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,420
What?

715
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,420
You always come home late.

716
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,420
I'm worried about you.

717
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,420
It's okay.

718
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,420
Don't worry about me.

719
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:25,420
We used to go out together on holidays.

720
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:29,420
You don't do that these days, do you?

721
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:32,420
What are you talking about?

722
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,420
Let's go again when you calm down.

723
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,420
But I feel lonely.

724
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:40,420
What? You are so cute.

725
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,420
You love me, don't you?

726
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:44,420
Stop it.

727
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,420
What?

728
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:55,420
You are not involved in strange things, are you?

729
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,420
Strange things?

730
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:03,420
Lately, you've become very beautiful.

731
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,420
Really?

732
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:09,420
I mean, your clothes...

733
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:13,420
You've become more fashionable.

734
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,420
Really?

735
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:20,420
I feel like you're different from usual.

736
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:24,420
Don't worry. I'm fine.

737
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:29,920
By the way, I'm making fried rice in the kitchen over there.

738
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,720
You like it, don't you, Aki?

739
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,720
Yeah, I love it.

740
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,420
Get up and have breakfast.

741
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,720
Got it?

742
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,420
I'll be right back.

743
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,920
Are you really leaving?

744
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,420
What do you mean, I'm really leaving?

745
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:44,920
I'm going. Bye.

746
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,920
Here.

747
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,920
I'll go with you.

748
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,920
Huh? Why is it here?

749
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,920
This way?

750
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,920
I'm sorry.

751
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,920
I'm sorry.

752
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,740
you can keep this away for another day or two for as long as you want?

753
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,980
You want to keep talking!

754
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:55,900
Many times, they told her to misuse the service orders, but she didn't for sure.

755
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:01,320
I changed her relationship with her ex-boyfriend

756
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:05,560
to move to a lower level.

757
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,300
It worked out great.

758
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,560
What she said was so frequent.

759
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:18,380
I felt sorry for her that she moved to a lower level.

760
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,380
Wow, that's amazing.

761
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:25,020
I said I was going too far.

762
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,620
I'm already addicted to it.

763
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:28,620
It feels really good.

764
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,820
Are you okay?

765
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:34,820
It's so hard.

766
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:43,820
It's so hard.

767
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,820
Hey, let me do it.

768
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,820
kun

769
01:37:58,520 --> 01:37:59,520
oh

770
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,480
kiss

771
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,640
show your hand

772
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,640
A little more?

773
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,640
A little more?

774
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,640
Let me see your tears.

775
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,640
I can't help it.

776
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

777
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,640
Amazing, amazing

778
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,640
Your body is moving so fast

779
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,640
Is it painful?

780
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,640
Is it painful?

781
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,640
Is it painful?

782
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,640
Ah, it feels good.

783
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,640
Even if it's painful, it feels good.

784
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,640
Hey, don't cry.

785
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,640
Come on.

786
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,640
It's not just you.

787
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,640
But...

788
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:45,180
Whoever it is,

789
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,960
please just feel free.

790
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,960
You want to lick it that fast?

791
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,960
It's good, isn't it?

792
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,960
It's good, isn't it?

793
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,960
How is it? Is it good?

794
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,960
What are you doing?

795
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,960
Oh, no.

796
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,960
Oh, no.

797
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,960
Look at me.

798
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,960
You like it, don't you?

799
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,700
Move this side as well.

800
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,960
You're the cutest when you're like this.

801
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,960
You're the cutest when you're like this.

802
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,960
I'm sorry.

803
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,960
What's wrong?

804
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,960
This scent is the cutest.

805
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,960
lol

806
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,960
What's wrong?

807
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,960
You can't stop eating at 3 o'clock.

808
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:23,960
I'm hungry.

809
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,960
Wanko

810
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,960
Wanko

811
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:32,960
Wanko

812
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:33,960
Wanko

813
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,960
I want to sleep.

814
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:37,960
I want to sleep.

815
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,960
How many do you want me to sleep?

816
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,960
How many do you want?

817
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,960
I want to sleep.

818
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,960
I want to sleep.

819
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,960
I'm sorry.

820
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,960
I'm sorry.

821
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,960
You're so annoying.

822
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,960
I'm sick.

823
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,960
Hurry up.

824
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,960
Are you sure you're okay?

825
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,960
Move it by yourself.

826
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,960
I want to take a closer look at your nails.

827
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,960
Look at me.

828
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,960
Look at my hand.

829
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,960
Look at my wide-open hand.

830
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,960
Yes, yes, yes.

831
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,960
Look at my hand.

832
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,960
Look at my hand.

833
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,960
Yes, yes, yes.

834
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,960
Ah!

835
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,960
Ah!

836
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,960
Ah!

837
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,960
Is it better to go to the back?

838
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,960
Back, back, back!

839
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,960
Back?

840
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,960
Ah!

841
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,960
What are you doing?

842
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,960
Hey, that's too much.

843
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,960
What are you going to do?

844
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:38,960
What's wrong?

845
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,960
Are you okay?

846
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Hey, are you okay?

847
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,960
What is this?

848
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,960
I'm sorry.

849
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,820
You want to be in that team?

850
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:29,820
I want to be in that team.

851
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:30,820
It's hard, isn't it?

852
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,820
Look forward next time.

853
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,820
What are you doing?

854
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:43,820
I'm listening.

855
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:45,820
A new girl is coming today, right?

856
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:48,820
Let's go together.

857
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:50,820
Come on in.

858
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:56,820
Look forward.

859
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,820
I'm sorry.

860
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:00,820
Hurry up.

861
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,820
Hey, hey, hey.

862
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:06,820
I saw a new person walking around.

863
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,820
I saw him walking around.

864
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,820
Hey, hey, hey.

865
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,820
Who's the new person?

866
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:14,820
I saw him sitting on the floor.

867
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,820
Hey, hey, hey.

868
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,820
Hey, hey, hey.

869
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,820
What's going on?

870
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:22,820
What are you doing?

871
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:24,820
What are you doing?

872
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:27,820
What are you guys doing here?

873
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,820
We're in the bathroom

874
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:30,820
What are you guys doing here?

875
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,820
It's not like that

876
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:32,820
It's not like that

877
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,820
We're just sitting in front of the door

878
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:35,820
And then

879
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:36,820
We're like

880
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,820
Who's that?

881
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,820
This is my little brother

882
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:44,820
Your little brother?

883
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,820
Oh, you're brothers?

884
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:48,820
Really?

885
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,820
What are you guys doing?

886
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:55,820
Please don't do that.

887
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:58,820
Hey, sis!

888
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:00,820
Please don't do that.

889
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,820
It's hard.

890
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:08,820
Are you serious?

891
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,820
It's getting harder.

892
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,820
Please don't do that.

893
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:20,820
It's hard.

894
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,820
It's OK. You're the big sister.

895
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:24,820
Please don't cry.

896
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:26,820
You're making a mess.

897
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,820
I'm sorry.

898
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:38,820
You're the big sister.

899
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:41,820
Wait.

900
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:43,820
You're saying big sister.

901
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:45,820
You're making a mess.

902
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:47,820
I'm sorry.

903
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:51,820
I'm going to look over here.

904
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:54,820
My brother is stiff.

905
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:03,820
It's too stiff.

906
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:14,820
No, no, no.

907
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,820
Stop it!

908
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:18,820
Stop it!

909
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,820
Stop it!

910
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,820
Don't touch her!

911
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,820
Don't touch her!

912
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,820
Don't touch her!

913
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:28,820
Don't touch her!

914
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,820
Don't touch her!

915
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:32,820
What are you doing?

916
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:34,820
She's mine!

917
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,820
Don't touch her!

918
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:38,820
Let's make her do it!

919
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,820
Let's make her do it!

920
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:42,820
Sorry!

921
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,820
That's too much!

922
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:46,820
Take it off!

923
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:48,820
Take it off!

924
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:50,820
This is fun!

925
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:52,820
Come on!

926
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:54,820
It's okay!

927
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,820
I've never seen this before!

928
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:00,820
Take it off!

929
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:02,820
Take it off!

930
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:04,820
Look at this!

931
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:06,820
Look at this!

932
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:08,820
It's on my shoulder!

933
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:10,820
No!

934
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:12,820
Wait a minute!

935
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,820
Stop it!

936
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:16,820
Hey!

937
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:18,820
My little brother!

938
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,820
My little brother!

939
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:22,820
He's sleeping!

940
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,820
Amazing!

941
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:26,820
He wakes up!

942
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:28,820
You know,

943
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:30,820
this woman,

944
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:32,820
she can sleep with anyone.

945
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:34,820
Really?

946
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:36,820
Really?

947
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:38,820
If she's a man, she can sleep with anyone.

948
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,820
Wow!

949
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,820
He's got a shovel!

950
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:44,820
What do you think of my brother's Chimpo?

951
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:46,820
It's delicious!

952
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:48,820
It's delicious!

953
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:50,820
Wow!

954
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,820
You did it, my brother!

955
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:56,820
Oh my brother!

956
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:02,820
Don't resist!

957
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:04,820
Wake him up!

958
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:06,820
Wake him up!

959
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:08,820
I'll do it for you.

960
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,820
I'll do it for you.

961
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,820
It's good, isn't it?

962
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,820
I'll do it for you.

963
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,820
He's saying, ah.

964
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:28,820
Damn it.

965
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:32,820
It's not like you can do anything.

966
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:34,820
I'm sure of it.

967
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:39,820
You have a great face.

968
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:45,820
You can do it.

969
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,820
It's amazing.

970
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:52,820
I don't know.

971
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:54,820
Really?

972
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:59,820
So you don't have any memory.

973
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:02,820
You don't even realize that it's going to fall off.

974
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:08,820
Don't drop it.

975
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:13,820
No?

976
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:15,820
Why not?

977
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:18,820
You love it, don't you?

978
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:20,820
Hold on.

979
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:22,820
Don't drop it.

980
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:24,820
What?

981
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:29,820
I want to put it in your mouth.

982
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:34,820
Are you okay?

983
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:40,820
I told you to be patient.

984
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:47,820
You can put it in your sister's mouth.

985
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:50,820
I didn't believe it.

986
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,820
I'm scared.

987
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:54,820
I want to cut it.

988
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,820
I'm still standing.

989
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,820
I'm still standing.

990
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:00,820
Why?

991
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:02,820
Why are you doing this?

992
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:04,820
I've always wanted to see it.

993
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:06,820
Hey, hey, hey.

994
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:08,820
Hey, hey, hey.

995
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,820
Hey, hey.

996
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,820
Hey.

997
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:14,820
Hey.

998
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:16,820
Hey.

999
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:18,820
Hey.

1000
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:20,820
Oh, my God.

1001
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:22,820
That's amazing.

1002
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:24,820
I know, right?

1003
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:26,820
I'm sorry.

1004
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:28,820
Oh, my God.

1005
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:30,820
Oh, my God.

1006
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:32,820
Oh, my God.

1007
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,820
Oh, my God.

1008
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:36,820
Oh, my God.

1009
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:38,820
Oh, my God.

1010
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,820
Oh, my God.

1011
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:42,820
Oh, my God.

1012
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,820
Oh, my God.

1013
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:46,820
Don't be angry!

1014
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:56,820
What's that on your face?

1015
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:03,820
I can see my sister's mark in front of me.

1016
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,820
Oh, my God.

1017
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:12,820
I'm going to faint.

1018
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:14,820
What?

1019
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:16,820
I want to do it.

1020
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:18,820
You can do it.

1021
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,820
You can do it.

1022
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:25,820
Stop it.

1023
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,820
Stop it.

1024
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:29,820
No, don't do it.

1025
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:00,820
Kiss! Kiss!

1026
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:27,820
Kiss! Kiss!

1027
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:32,820
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1028
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:29,820
Don't you know?

1029
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:31,820
You don't know?

1030
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:33,820
I don't know.

1031
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,820
Don't you know?

1032
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:37,820
Don't you know?

1033
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,820
Don't you know?

1034
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:45,820
I don't know.

1035
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:17,820
What's wrong?

1036
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:19,820
I'm scared.

1037
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,820
I'm scared.

1038
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:23,820
I'm scared.

1039
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:27,820
I'm scared.

1040
02:02:57,820 --> 02:02:58,820
I'm sorry.

1041
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,820
I'm sorry.

1042
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:04,820
Don't cry.

1043
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:06,820
No...

1044
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:10,820
I'm sorry.

1045
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,820
What are you talking about?

1046
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:44,820
It's so hard!

1047
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:47,820
I can't do it anymore.

1048
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:55,820
It's so hard!

1049
02:03:55,820 --> 02:04:00,820
It's so hard!

1050
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:04,820
It's so hard!

1051
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:07,820
It's so hard!

1052
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:38,820
Wait a minute.

1053
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:39,820
You're going to die?

1054
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:41,820
Are you okay?

1055
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:43,820
This is bad.

1056
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,820
Ouch!

1057
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:49,820
What is this?

1058
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:51,820
What is it?

1059
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:53,820
I'm scared.

1060
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,820
I'm scared.

1061
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:57,820
Did you decide it at home?

1062
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:27,820
What are you doing?!

1063
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:55,300
What is it, Tanaka?

1064
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:31,300
Aki, help me.

1065
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:34,300
Aki?

1066
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,300
Aki?

1067
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:38,300
Aki?

1068
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:41,300
Aki?

1069
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:44,300
What are you doing?

1070
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:47,300
What are you doing?

1071
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:52,300
Aki, what are you doing?

1072
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,300
Wait!

1073
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:54,300
Akina!

1074
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,300
No!

1075
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,300
No!

1076
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:57,300
Akina!

1077
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:58,300
No!

1078
02:07:58,300 --> 02:07:59,300
Wait!

1079
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,300
No!

1080
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,300
Wait!

1081
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,300
No!

1082
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,300
No!

1083
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:04,300
Why?

1084
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:05,300
Why?

1085
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:06,300
Akina!

1086
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:07,300
No!

1087
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,300
No!

1088
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:09,300
No!

1089
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,300
No!

1090
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:11,300
No!

1091
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:12,300
No!

1092
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:13,300
Ah!

1093
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:14,300
Ah!

1094
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:15,300
Ah!

1095
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:16,300
Wait!

1096
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,300
What are you doing?

1097
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:18,300
Akina!

1098
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:19,300
What are you doing?

1099
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,300
Hey, wait!

1100
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:21,300
No!

1101
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:21,300
Hey...

1102
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:22,300
What?

1103
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:23,300
Hey!

1104
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:24,300
Hey!

1105
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:25,300
No, don't do it.

1106
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:26,300
Hey!

1107
02:08:26,300 --> 02:08:27,300
What?

1108
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:28,300
No, no!

1109
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,300
What are you doing?

1110
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:30,300
Hey!

1111
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:31,300
Hey!

1112
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,300
Wait a second.

1113
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:34,300
Go away.

1114
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:35,300
Stop.

1115
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:36,300
What are you doing?

1116
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:37,300
No, please.

1117
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:39,300
No, please.

1118
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,300
Hey, don't!

1119
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:41,300
Hey, stop it.

1120
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:42,300
Please stop it.

1121
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:43,300
No, please.

1122
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:44,300
What are you doing?

1123
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:45,300
Stop!

1124
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,300
Let go of me!

1125
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,300
Let go of me!

1126
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:48,300
Stop it!

1127
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:49,300
Come on!

1128
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,300
No!

1129
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:53,300
Let me go!

1130
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:57,300
Let me go!

1131
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:59,300
No! Let me go!

1132
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:01,300
No! No!

1133
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:03,300
No!

1134
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:11,300
What are you doing?

1135
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:13,300
Come on, hurry up and cry!

1136
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:19,300
Wait a minute.

1137
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,300
Wow.

1138
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:21,300
Wow.

1139
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:23,300
She's a big sister, so she's a good match.

1140
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,300
What do you mean?

1141
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:25,300
Wait a minute.

1142
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:27,300
It's okay.

1143
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:28,300
It's okay.

1144
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:29,300
What do you mean?

1145
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:30,300
Come here.

1146
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:31,300
Come here.

1147
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,300
Hurry up.

1148
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:35,300
It's hot.

1149
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:36,300
It's hot.

1150
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:37,300
It's hot.

1151
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:38,300
It's hot.

1152
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:39,300
It's okay.

1153
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:11,300
It's okay.

1154
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,300
It's okay.

1155
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:17,300
It's okay.

1156
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,300
I'm sorry.

1157
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:25,300
I'm sorry.
