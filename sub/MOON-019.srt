00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,980
FUJISAKI YUKARI in the middle of the night

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Hello!

3
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,300
It's hot, isn't it? It's so hot.

4
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,500


5
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,020
Yes, it was hot.

6
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:01,980
Really? Yes, it was.

7
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,450


8
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,180
It's hot, isn't it?

9
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,700
That's why I brought a special watermelon.

10
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,520
It was a little heavy, though.

11
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:18,320
This is a mini-watermelon.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,380
It's a little hot,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

13
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,580


14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,640
Let's cool it down and eat it.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Yes.

16
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,600
It's good, isn't
it? No, it's not.

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,721
Is that so? Yes, it is.

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,860
You guys seem to get along well.

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,720
Not at all, not at all.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Really?

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
Yes.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
But you two are close, aren't you?

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,040
We don't have any special relationship.

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Really?

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
What about you, Akemi?

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,630
I don't want you to say it, but my
husband has been cheating on me lately.

27
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,230
Really?

28
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:19,521
I didn't mean to look at it, but I was on my phone
on the table, and it wasn't locked, so I didn't

29
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:26,830
mean to look at it, but when I looked at LINE, I
was having a fun conversation with a young woman.

30
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,010
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

31
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,270
I've never seen him saying,

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,550
I'll be there,

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,950
even though he sent me a
message that he'll be there.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,810
Oh my god,

35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,050
I can't believe it.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,870
I'm not going to say anything,

37
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,130
but he's going to make money

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,170
for me, right?

39
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:54,990
But divorce is

40
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,470
Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

41
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,550
If I go there, as long as Marudake
doesn't tell me, I don't want to do it.

42
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,690
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,530
Do you want to take a doctor
and go on a trip with everyone?

44
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,070
That's a good idea.

45
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,150
But I don't care about that.

46
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,230
It doesn't matter to me.

47
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,490
But, you know, in LINE,

48
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,270
you don't have to send a
message that you are sexless.

49
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,271


50
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,270
You don't have to do that.

51
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,690
Don't you think so?

52
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:31,691
I can't believe it.

53
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,250
That's true.

54
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,770
But,

55
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:39,390
if you have been together for a long
time, couples are like that, aren't they?

56
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,050
We haven't been together for years.

57
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,051
I don't think so.

58
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,990
Sexist is normal.

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,470
Is that so?

60
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,190
How about you,
Yukari? Well, I'm.

61
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,110
..

62
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,591
Well, I'm... I'm fine.

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,210
Well... I've been less often.

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,710
But, I do it a little.

65
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,050
That's great.

66
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,410
That's great.

67
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,890
Well... I don't know.

68
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,610
Actually, I'm a little more like a work.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,210
Actually, I'm a little more like a priest.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,890
I wanted to do something like this.

71
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,530
That's a luxury.

72
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,730
I want you to do it.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,650
Like this?

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,270
I want to do this.

75
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,430
I want to do this.

76
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,750
Like this?

77
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:34,950
You are so cute.

78
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,690
You are so cute.

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,890
You look like you are
eating fruit with your husband.

80
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,070
I am worried about what will happen.

81
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,170
I think we will wait for a while.

82
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,030
I think so, too.

83
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,591
It would be better if you ate it.

84
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,410
What's going on?

85
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,630
Are you wearing a heart when you transform?

86
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,910
Of course I am!

87
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,570
That's great!
I want my husband to wear it too!

88
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,590
You're not wearing
it? No, I'm not.

89
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,750
It's like a circle.

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Welcome back.

91
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm back.

92
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,140
Are you hungry?

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes.

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
Is it curry today?

95
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,540
Yes.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,781
I haven't eaten curry for a long time.

97
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,480
Do you want to drink
with me? Sounds good.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,420
Let's go out.

99
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,160


100
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
OK.

101
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
I'll change my clothes.

102
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,460
OK.

103
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,210
I can't afford this.

104
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,270
Look at this!

105
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,630
Oh! Wait a minute for a moment!

106
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,650
Oh! Wait!

107
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:21,175
Oh! Wait!

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,530
It's filled with so much bubbles.

109
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,990
Amazing!

110
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,490
Wow!

111
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,790
Wow!

112
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
It looks delicious.

113
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,450
Thank you.

114
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,550
It's a special way to open.

115
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,630
Yes, I found it.

116
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,310
I opened it randomly.

117
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,130
Ah, wait, wait, wait.

118
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,085
I have more than you.

119
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,890
Really?

120
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,190
You have more than I.

121
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,250
I see.

122
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,470
I'll give you this one.

123
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,110
No, it's OK.

124
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,410
I'm OK with this much.

125
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:57,890
Really?

126
00:07:58,265 --> 00:07:59,786
Next time, I'll drink a different one.

127
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,321
Thank you for your hard work.

128
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:05,736
Thank you for your hard work.

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,830
It's delicious.

130
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,320
It was hot today, too.

131
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,550
Are you okay? It was hot, wasn't it?

132
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,551
I'm going to make curry.

133
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,030
But it's okay.

134
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,910
Let's eat.

135
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,610
I'll eat, too.

136
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,930
It's delicious.

137
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,860
I think we should open a shop.

138
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
A shop?

139
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,140
Can I do it alone? Yes, you can.

140
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640


141
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm going to be a waiter.

142
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Really?

143
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Who are you going to be?

144
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm going to be a cook and
you're going to be a waiter?

145
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:02,780
Yes.

146
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,680
I'm going to be a waitress.

147
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Waitress?

148
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,080
Don't waitresses usually cook?

149
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,460
Yes.

150
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I see.

151
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
You should wear maid clothes.

152
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Me?

153
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm going to be a cook.

154
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
I see.

155
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,760
We live in a time like that.

156
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,380
I'm sure it suits you.

157
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,650
What did you use as a
secret ingredient? Apple? I see.

158
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,270


159
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,330


160
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:38,270
This is a secret.

161
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,380
If you say so.

162
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,340
That's why it's so sour.

163
00:09:48,790 --> 00:10:09,320
It's a good drink.

164
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
My throat is dry.

165
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
What's wrong?

166
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,260
My throat is dry.

167
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,520
What's wrong?

168
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,400
I took a picture of the
trip I went to the other day.

169
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,180
Oh, I see.

170
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,620
Did you edit it? I edited it.

171
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,560
I didn't know.

172
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040


173
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,120
It's a little blurry,
so I'll make it clearer.

174
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,600
That's great. It's like a poster.

175
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
I was praised.

176
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,690
Let's go again.

177
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
To the southern island.

178
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,100
There is also a hot spring.

179
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,360
Where? Hot spring.

180
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,080
Oh, I like it, too.

181
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,620
We've been there quite a few times.

182
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,320
There are a lot of Hakone
because it's a suburb.

183
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,470
Yeah, how many times have we been there?

184
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,180
We've been there quite a few times.

185
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,535
I feel like I've said it all.

186
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Like Izu.

187
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,740
Yeah.

188
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,840
It's a little far.

189
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
It's even further.

190
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,800
Oh, even further?

191
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
We've been to Nishi-Izu.

192
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,420
Oh, Nishi-Izu.

193
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,421
It's good, isn't it?

194
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,480
Did we go to Nishizu by train?

195
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
It's quite tough.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,960
It ends at Shimoda, so we
have to go this way, don't we?

197
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,520
I think we have to go by rental car.

198
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,720
It was very delicious.

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Thank you.

200
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,670
Do you want to drink a little more?

201
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,270
I'll have a little more.

202
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,380
What should we do next?

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
How about a light one?

204
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,380
How about a fruity one?

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Sounds good!

206
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,760
I'll take this one.

207
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Really? Here you are.

208
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,300
Thank you.

209
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Thank you.

210
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,840
How much? This much.

211
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,140


212
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,420
Are you OK? You eat fast.

213
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,670


214
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,660
I found something.

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,380
Thank you.

216
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,540
I always watch you.

217
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,240
By the way, I'm sweating a lot.

218
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Don't you sweat?

219
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,780
Well, it was hot today.

220
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,800
Do you want me to take a shower?

221
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,860
Sorry, I haven't taken a bath yet.

222
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,560
It's hot, so I'll just take a shower.

223
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,660
Oh, I see.

224
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Can I have some sake? Oh, sure.

225
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,580


226
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Thank you for the meal.

227
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,680
It's hot.

228
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:04,680
I did my best.

229
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,980
What did I do wrong?

230
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,360
I should have thought a little more.

231
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:17,801
I wonder if it would have been
better if I hadn't been there.

232
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,320
Let's go in together.

233
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,110
You're sleepy, aren't you?

234
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I'm not sleepy today.

235
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,620
It's hot, but I've been walking a lot.

236
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,460
It's cold.

237
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Turn it off.

238
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
What?

239
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,920
It's still hot, isn't
it? No, it's cold.

240
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,020


241
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,370
Really? Yes, I'm happy.

242
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,410


243
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,680
How was today's meal?

244
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,380
It was delicious.

245
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
It's always delicious.

246
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Yes.

247
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,960
Let me know if you feel sick.

248
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:48,760
Do you want to sleep?

249
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:59,950
Do you want to
take it off? It's cold.

250
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,060


251
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,150
I'll take it off.

252
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,220
I woke up a little.

253
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,510
Can't you sleep?

254
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,250
No.

255
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,620
But I'm sleepy, so can I go to bed first?

256
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Yes.

257
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,980
Thank you for your hard work.

258
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,940
Thank you.

259
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,980
Good night.

260
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,380
Good night.

261
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,381
I'm sorry.

262
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Yukari Fujisaki I see.

263
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040


264
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,510
Oh, you can buy it at Rakuten.

265
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,160
You can buy it at Rakuten.

266
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,460
I see.

267
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
It's hot every day.

268
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,640
Oh, I see.

269
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
White!

270
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,680
White! I'm not sure.

271
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:41,681
It looks good.

272
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880


273
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:48,760
It's not that bad.

274
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm eating it.

275
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
You're eating it.

276
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,300
But it's white.

277
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I see.

278
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,960
I think I'm the fattest.

279
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,560
You're fat and short.

280
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,260
Stop it!

281
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Are you laughing?

282
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,600
No, I'm not laughing.

283
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,140
You're laughing a lot.

284
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
No, I'm not.

285
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,600
I'd like to ask you about your husband.

286
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
How is he doing?

287
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,060
He's in the middle of swimming.

288
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,360
I'll have sashimi for dinner.

289
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
What's that?

290
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,600
Sashimi? Why?

291
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:31,041
You're letting him swim, aren't you?

292
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,000
Then, fish and sashimi.

293
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,140
Wow, that's great!
You're so bold.

294
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,850
I'm surprised.

295
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340


296
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
What's that?

297
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,180
Hey, hey, hey, listen.

298
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,620
It's been a while since I had
dinner with my husband last night.

299
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Really?

300
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,040
You heard it, didn't you?

301
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
What's wrong with you?

302
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Did you have a good time?

303
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,340
Do you know Kogi? I don't know.

304
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700


305
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,500
Kogi? Dog? No, it's not.

306
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,061
Is it katakana? No, it's kanji.

307
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,480


308
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,900
It's written as Yuukinuki on the back.

309
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,320
You know Zengi,
right? Yes, I know.

310
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,460
Yes, that kind of story.

311
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,840
Zen practice is done
before marriage, isn't it?

312
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,160
It's like the end version of that.

313
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,900
Oh, so you do something like Zen practice
again after marriage? Yes, yes, yes.

314
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,440


315
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,460
I looked it up on the
Internet, and it said,

316
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:36,781
deepening the love of
the couple, so I tried it.

317
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,300


318
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,320
Then, I heard that my
husband was fine, too.

319
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,700
So, I kissed him today.

320
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,000
It's great, isn't
it? It's great.

321
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,560


322
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,560
Hey, what kind of things do you do?

323
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,560
What I saw was,

324
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
like good manners,

325
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,620
hugging, skinship,

326
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,000
those are also included in the lecture.

327
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,040
You know, in sex,

328
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,980
when a man is satisfied, it's over.

329
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,600
But women are not satisfied at all.

330
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,120
So, in the lecture,

331
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,810
it's important to be with a
woman until she is satisfied.

332
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660
That's right.

333
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,820
I'm not satisfied at all.

334
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:35,600
Yukari-san, your voice is too loud.

335
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
I don't like it.

336
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
I'm sorry.

337
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,040
Be careful.
I don't know who is listening to you.

338
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,000
So, you should look it up.

339
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
What? Look it up.

340
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,180
I got it.

341
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,300
Thank you.

342
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm leaving.

343
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:56,860
See you.

344
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
See you.

345
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,360
It's so hot.

346
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:00,361


347
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,610
What was it?

348
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,590
A lecture?

349
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,540
The snow in the back.

350
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,970
What?

351
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,530
【Q】What is the most common
form of sexual harassment?

352
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,170
1.Sexual harassment that is done in
a manner that is forced upon a woman.

353
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,970
2.Sexual harassment that is done in
a manner that is forced upon a man.

354
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:05,890
3.Sexual harassment that is done in
a manner that is forced upon a woman.

355
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:17,130
In the lecture, it is said
to put a kiss on the cheek.

356
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,270
What if I add it to my eyelids?

357
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:32,930
If you sleep, your partner will
be satisfied and go to bed early.

358
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,130
Oh, this kind of thing. I know.

359
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,710
skinship

360
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
light kiss

361
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,630
skinship of sexual intercourse other
than sexual intercourse touch on hair

362
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
touch on face

363
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,597
After a short break, such
as lying on each other's

364
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,790
arms and lying on each
other's shoulders and sleeping,

365
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,264
enjoy meals together,
take a bath together, talk

366
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:07,350
while lying down, and
extend your daily life.

367
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:08,351
Today's lecture.

368
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,990
Wow.

369
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,270
Oh, I see.

370
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,050
Well.

371
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:21,630
Well.

372
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:23,850
Hug the first line of the page carefully.

373
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,310
Hug, French kiss, soft touch.

374
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,410
Measure the skin-ship
and enter the second line.

375
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:40,591
If you can't see the recovery of the side that was
satisfied first, the side that is not satisfied can

376
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:49,810
be a little patient and exchange opinions on both
sides, make improvements, and move on to the next time.

377
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:56,297
If you have plenty of time, you
can take a long break at the entrance

378
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:03,090
or at the table, and then you can
be satisfied enough by doing it twice.

379
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:04,115
I have a weak point.

380
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,150
Hmm.

381
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,390
I see.

382
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,170
Hmm.

383
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,370
I don't even give a lecture at Bonobo.

384
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,030
Hmm.

385
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,970
Oh, that Bonobo.

386
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,790
It is a human privilege to give a lecture.

387
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:32,791
It's a bit strange.

388
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,191
I'll talk to him during dinner.

389
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:01,355
Good sound.

390
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,950
Good.

391
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,630
Lemon sour.

392
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,090
Good sound.

393
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,030
Thank you.

394
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:22,906
I put a lot of vegetables
because they were cheap.

395
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,211
I put a lot of vegetables in it.

396
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
It's good.

397
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,020
Is it good?

398
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,560
When I eat heavy food, my chest hurts.

399
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
Your chest hurts?

400
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,680
Yes.

401
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,760
Oh, I see.

402
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
That's right.

403
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,160
Let's eat.

404
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,180
It's a little expensive today.

405
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,000
It's a little colorful,
isn't it? It's delicious.

406
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
It's the best.

407
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,790
Oh, look.

408
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,810


409
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,110
This time, I'm going to
the museum I always go to.

410
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,510
The museum?

411
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,550
Yes, the museum.

412
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,591
I'm going to have a special
exhibition of my favorite fish.

413
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,580
Is that so?

414
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:38,850
Yes.

415
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,390
Since when?

416
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,791
It's been about a week since I tasted it.

417
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,490
A week ago?

418
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,790
No, a week later.

419
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,550
A week later?

420
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,870
Is that so? That's soon.

421
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,030


422
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:51,670
What about the ticket?

423
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:52,671
What about you?

424
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,450
I thought I'd take a ticket
if I could go with you.

425
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,250
Really? Thank you.

426
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,770
Can you go with me?

427
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,730
Yes.

428
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,920
Vegetables are fat.

429
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,660
I feel guilty.

430
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,726
What are you going to do if
you lose weight more than that?

431
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,750
Am I thin? That's all.

432
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280


433
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,760
Is that so?

434
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:24,000
Do you think so? Yes, I do.

435
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760


436
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:33,060
But I wanted more meat around here.

437
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,060
Around here?

438
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Yes.

439
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,160
I have a big butt.

440
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,000
So I wanted more breasts.

441
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
Other men would see it.

442
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,160
Other men? Yes, other men.

443
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,600


444
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,936
I wonder if they would see it.

445
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,300
I always wear fluffy clothes.

446
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,340
I don't know.

447
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,620
But I don't meet men at all.

448
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,380
Really?

449
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
I go out in the daytime.

450
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,121
It doesn't matter if it's daytime.

451
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Yeah.

452
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,271
It's not necessarily that there are no men.

453
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,361
Because I go around the
house and the supermarket.

454
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,880
Is it good? Yeah.

455
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,220


456
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:23,900
You're happy, aren't you?

457
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
It's great that the rice is delicious.

458
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,530
Oh, it's very soft.

459
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,880
Do you know Kogi?

460
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Kogi?

461
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,100
It's a kind of dog,
isn't it? No, it's not.

462
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Kogi.

463
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,140


464
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Kogi?

465
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
What's that?

466
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,020
What is Kogi?

467
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,270
Kogi is a character.

468
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,080
Character?

469
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,620
Character?

470
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,460
How do you write it?

471
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,020
In Kanji, you write 後の遊戯 and then Kogi.

472
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,020
Oh.

473
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Yeah.

474
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
後の遊戯.

475
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Yeah.

476
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Don't you understand?

477
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
What?

478
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,780
So, you know, you do that.

479
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,440
That? That.

480
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:14,980


481
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,160
What? After that.

482
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,940
After that.

483
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,620
After that.

484
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:19,621


485
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,040
What? What? That.

486
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,760
At night.

487
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040


488
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580


489
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,060
Something like that?

490
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Yes.

491
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
Well.

492
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
At night.

493
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
After that.

494
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,160
After that.

495
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,286
You mean the one you do in the morning
and the one you do in the afternoon?

496
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,720
Yes, the one I do in the morning
and the one I do in the afternoon.

497
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,616
Zen-gi is the one you
do in the morning, right?

498
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,600
And the one I do in the
afternoon is called Kogi.

499
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,060
I see.

500
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,240
I can understand it somehow.

501
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,040
You have your own words.

502
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Yes, I do.

503
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:17,020
This afternoon, I met my friend,
Kinjo, and she told me a lot of things.

504
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
We did a lot of research.

505
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,676
Is that what you were talking about?

506
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Yes.

507
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
I see.

508
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,200
I like that kind of conversation.

509
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:35,280
While you were working hard, I was talking
about craftsmanship, and I looked it up.

510
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,540
Did you look it up?

511
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
Yes.

512
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,320
Well, I looked up a lot of things today.

513
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,941
What's that? You wrote a lot of characters.

514
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,680
Look.

515
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,260
Is craftsmanship that difficult?

516
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:51,261
What is Kougi?

517
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,070
To put it simply,

518
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,820
it is a mandatory act that
makes you tired of sleepiness.

519
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,320
By doing Kougi,

520
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,530
it affects your daily life,

521
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,040
and causes sleepiness.

522
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,791
Isn't it a very important
thing? Yes, it is.

523
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640


524
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
And,

525
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:21,715
This is a place where you can touch the skin
of your genitals, touch your hair, touch

526
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:29,720
your face, touch your arm pillows, lie
down, rest a little and then eat together,

527
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,540
take baths, talk while lying
down, and extend your daily life.

528
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,781
This extension is also a kougi.

529
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,800
It's quite wide.

530
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,880
Yes, it is.

531
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,540
I think everyone does it.

532
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Don't they? Well, yes.

533
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,580


534
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,360
They take a shower together.

535
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,760
We haven't taken a shower yet.

536
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,440
They eat together and have fun.

537
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,770
For example, this is a kougi.

538
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
This is a kougi.

539
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:02,786
But we haven't done it yet.

540
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,840
I see.

541
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:04,420
I see.

542
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
You're sharp.

543
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,860
No, I'm not. This is Zenki.

544
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,180
Oh, I see.

545
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
Yes, this is Zenki.

546
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,340
I see.

547
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:11,360
Yes.

548
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,190
You're smart.

549
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,121
I don't know, but I think so.

550
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
I see.

551
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:18,520
Yes.

552
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I see.

553
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,850
So, shall we do it
today? What? Kogi.

554
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,480


555
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,080


556
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,380
Kogi?

557
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,680
Yes, shall we do Kogi today?

558
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,320
Today?

559
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,860
Yes.

560
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,320
It's a good chance.

561
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,470
I see.

562
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:37,440
I see.

563
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,120
I see.

564
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:38,760
I see.

565
00:43:38,761 --> 00:43:38,840
I see.

566
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:38,880
I see.

567
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,400
I see.

568
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:40,960
I see.

569
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,040
I see.

570
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:42,540
I see.

571
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
I see.

572
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460
I see.

573
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
I see.

574
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,240
I see.

575
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:49,980
I see.

576
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,820
I see.

577
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,920
I see.

578
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,260
I see.

579
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:54,340
I see.

580
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,980
I see.

581
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
I see.

582
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,510
I see.

583
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,300
I see.

584
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:02,320
Wait a minute. Let's take a bath together.

585
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,620
Do you want to take a
bath together? Today.

586
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,540
..

587
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,320
But...

588
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,100
It's a little embarrassing.

589
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
Hey, listen.

590
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,460
Do you know Bonobo?

591
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,780
Bonobo? Yes, Bonobo.

592
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,050


593
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
A car?

594
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:17,900
No.

595
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280
Isn't that Bonobo?

596
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,440
What's that?

597
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,260
Bonobo is like a monkey.

598
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,980
It's like a chimpanzee.

599
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
Do you know?

600
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,461
I don't know much about it.

601
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What is it? Bonobo.

602
00:44:30,095 --> 00:44:31,095
Look up Bonobo.

603
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Bonobo.

604
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
Bonobo.

605
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Here.

606
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,400
Anyway, Bonobo has a lot of sex.

607
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,910
What?

608
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:52,530
What do you think?

609
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,670
He has a lot of sex.

610
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,670
Yes. Isn't it amazing?

611
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,450
He can't differentiate
between male and female.

612
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,140
What?

613
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,220
He has a lot of sex?

614
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:09,080
It's amazing, isn't it?

615
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:09,540
It's amazing, isn't it?

616
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,820
I used to do it on TV before.

617
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:11,540
I used to do it on TV before.

618
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
I'm doing a lot of sex.

619
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,080
I'm doing a lot of sex.

620
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,880
I'm doing a lot of sex.

621
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,220
I'm doing a lot of sex.

622
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,160
I'm doing a lot of sex.

623
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:17,580
I'm doing a lot of sex.

624
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
I'm doing a lot of sex.

625
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,460
I'm doing a lot of sex.

626
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:19,540
I'm doing a lot of sex.

627
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:20,100
I'm doing a lot of sex.

628
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:21,180
I'm doing a lot of sex.

629
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,660
I'm doing a lot of sex.

630
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I'm doing a lot of sex.

631
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
I'm doing a lot of sex.

632
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
I'm doing a lot of sex.

633
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,220
I'm doing a lot of sex.

634
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,280
I'm doing a lot of sex.

635
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,020
I'm doing a lot of sex.

636
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,480
Are you pregnant? No, I'm not.

637
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:38,475


638
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,050
Genetics is strong.

639
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,941
There is only a strong one.

640
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,740
In other words, there is only a life
and death that wins in competition.

641
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,020
It's amazing.

642
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,260
I knew it.

643
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,660
It was compared on TV.

644
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,340
It was compared to the movement
of the life and death of a human male.

645
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,940
What does it mean?

646
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,201
Does it mean that humans are weak?

647
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:14,452
It means that humans
are getting weaker because

648
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:16,126
they are made up of
one part and one part.

649
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,710
So, one part and one part are not good?

650
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,560
It means that weakness is being copied.

651
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,770
It's like a group of people
who are about to have sex.

652
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,020
It's like a plurality.

653
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,160
It's like a group of people
who are about to have sex.

654
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,321
It's like a group of people
who are about to have sex.

655
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,720
Is that so?

656
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,640
Is that so?

657
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,820
Like a family?

658
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,760
Like a family?

659
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:39,820
Like a family?

660
00:46:39,821 --> 00:46:40,821
Like a family?

661
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Like a family?

662
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,320
Like a family?

663
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,040
Like a family?

664
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,041
Like a family?

665
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Like a family?

666
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,660
Like a family?

667
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:51,400
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

668
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,720
I heard that even a
monk doesn't do a ritual.

669
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
You don't do a
ritual? That's right.

670
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,880
I heard that only
humans do a ritual.

671
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
This is amazing.

672
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,271
I don't think there's
anything you don't do.

673
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Think about it.

674
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,461
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

675
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,200
I had a little problem recently.

676
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,540
What?

677
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,780
Your sex was very plain.

678
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,620
Plain? Plain.

679
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,080
It was plain, wasn't
it? Yes, it was.

680
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,020
It was like an
extension of work.

681
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,440
It ended quickly.

682
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,280
I took a shower quickly.

683
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,131
I turned my back and went to bed quickly.

684
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,900
I was worried about that.

685
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
I see.

686
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,240
Yes.

687
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:46,700
I didn't notice.

688
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,400
That's why I did my best today.

689
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,560
I'm sorry.

690
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,600
I made you worried.

691
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,400
Have you finished eating?

692
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,330
Yes.

693
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,770
Well,

694
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,100
I'm going to take a shower.

695
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,040
Together?

696
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,041
What is it?

697
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Well,

698
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,080
you know,

699
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,171
you have to turn around
to write a poem, right?

700
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,200
Yes.

701
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,300
So,

702
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,596
I want you to look forward to the next one.

703
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,200
The next one? Yes, yes, yes.

704
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,460


705
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,900
So, I'll go first.

706
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,820


707
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:32,440
Huh?

708
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,320
The next one? I'll be back.

709
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:34,321


710
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:35,986
Are you looking forward to it?

711
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,080
Well,

712
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,300
yes.

713
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Bye.

714
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,100
Bye.

715
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:43,101
Later.

716
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,900
OK.

717
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,910
You know,

718
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:26,810
I can't help but be conscious of you.

719
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,150
I know.

720
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:54,500
What are you doing?

721
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,280
Why are you laughing?

722
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,480
Do you want to do it?

723
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,460
Yes.

724
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,780
It's hard to do.

725
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:33,740
Well, if you don't mind, you
can do it when you feel like it.

726
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:35,740
I'm going to sleep.

727
00:54:33,385 --> 00:54:36,120
Hey, you can go to sleep now.

728
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:38,240
Do you want to take it off?

729
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:49,750
Do you want to take it off?

730
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,010
Yes.

731
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,040
Your face.

732
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,230
What? Is it weird?
Lend it to me.

733
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,550


734
00:58:20,390 --> 01:00:26,970
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

735
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,030
Please be aware that this is a
derivative work of the Touhou Project.

736
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:27,510
Please be aware that this is a
derivative work of the Touhou Project.

737
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:28,511
It might be dangerous.

738
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,860
Let's do it.

739
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,630
Oh, it came out a lot.

740
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,740
I have a handkerchief, too.

741
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,360
Thank you.

742
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
What?

743
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,820
Does it hurt?

744
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,240
Yes.

745
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,100
Thank you.

746
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,880
Is it cold?

747
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,640
No, but it's not that bad.

748
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,560
Hey.

749
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:31,600
Yes?

750
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Let's have a coffee.

751
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
Yes.

752
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,220
Coffee?

753
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,716
What are you going to do today?

754
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,700
Is this a lecture? Yes, it is.

755
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,580


756
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,660
What are you going to do?

757
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,190
I'm going to have a
skin-shaping session after this.

758
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,310
Skin-shaping?

759
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,710
That's a big budget.

760
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,910
It says I have to stroke your hair.

761
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:13,560
There is also a route written on it.

762
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,700
What's wrong? Is it stuck?

763
01:03:15,701 --> 01:03:16,701
Is this okay?

764
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,260
It's got hair on it.

765
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
Give me a second.

766
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,460
Give me a second.

767
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
No, you can't smell it.

768
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:13,920
Why?

769
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,060
Are you sweating?

770
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:19,570
You're sweating.

771
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,250
Stop it.

772
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,640
It was hot during the
day, so you're sweating.

773
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,390
Why?

774
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,001
Why are you sniffing
too much? I'm sweating.

775
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:37,470


776
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,540
Oh, is that so?

777
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:52,710
How was it? It felt good.

778
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,770


779
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,710
I've never touched your
hands like this before.

780
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,541
Maybe it was a little rough
because I was doing housework.

781
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,650
Thank you for everything.

782
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,990
I really like you.

783
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,210
Really?

784
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,860
But...

785
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,800
Just a little more...

786
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:57,521
It felt good, but just a
little more... A little more?

787
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:07,260
I want to make other people feel good, too.

788
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,240
What do you mean?

789
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,281
I want to make you feel better.

790
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:35,960
I want you to lick me.

791
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,500
Lick you?

792
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:40,300
What is it?

793
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:45,300
What do you want
me to eat? Your face.

794
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,640
Your tongue.

795
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,540


796
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,480
My tongue?

797
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,960
It's hot!

798
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,520
Really? Is it that
hot? Around there.

799
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,220


800
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,920
I want you to eat it.

801
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,160
Your breath is warm.

802
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
Your nose is breathing.

803
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,140
Your breath is hot.

804
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:38,180
It's hot.

805
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,440
It's hot, isn't it? It's okay.

806
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,660
It's the wind.

807
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:53,780
It feels good.

808
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:19,100
I'm fine.

809
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,030
I'm sorry.

810
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:53,010
Is it like this?

811
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,590
Yes, it feels good.

812
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,720
Which part of the body did you feel good?

813
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,900
It's been a long time, so forget it.

814
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,870
It's like a fish.

815
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,660
My stomach feels good, too.

816
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:34,200
It feels so good.

817
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:27,450
It's hot, isn't it?

818
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,330
It's hot, isn't it?

819
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,990
It's hot, isn't it?

820
01:11:49,880 --> 01:12:24,640
Oh, it feels good...

821
01:12:40,680 --> 01:13:44,530
Yeah, that's right.

822
01:14:58,125 --> 01:15:47,020
I'm sleepy...

823
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,760
Thank you for your hard work.

824
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,480
It's so hot.

825
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:58,130
It's so hot.

826
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:02,890
It's so hot.

827
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:06,070
I'm fine.

828
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:13,570
It doesn't hurt, does it?

829
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:14,571
Doesn't it hurt? No, it doesn't.

830
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:16,610


831
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,770
It felt so good.

832
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,360
Let's start from the side.

833
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,110
Oh, I'm sorry.

834
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,430
It's not that hot.

835
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,320
Is it hot?

836
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,360
It's hot, isn't it?

837
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,040
It's painful, isn't it?

838
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,570
It smells again.

839
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,300
Are you okay?

840
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,520
Is it that bad? I don't know.

841
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

842
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,320
I'm sorry.

843
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,370


844
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,700
You're sweating a lot today.

845
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,220
Really?

846
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,040
I think you should let it out a little.

847
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,280
I know.

848
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,640
It's difficult.

849
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,120
It's difficult.

850
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,780
Do you want to take a shower?

851
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,820
Do you want to take a shower together?

852
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,340
Yes.

853
01:18:43,545 --> 01:18:44,626
I'm going to take a shower.

854
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,180
Take a shower?

855
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,360
Yes.

856
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,480
Okay.

857
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:49,580
I got it.

858
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,720
Okay.

859
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,400
It's hot.

860
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:58,240
No, it's not.

861
01:18:58,241 --> 01:18:58,640
Is it hot? Yes, it's hot.

862
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,200


863
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,380
Really? It's hot.

864
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,250


865
01:19:31,825 --> 01:19:35,220
Let's take a shower and do something.

866
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:36,340
This is my room.

867
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,660
Yes, it is.

868
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:40,620
Did you make it? Yes, I did.

869
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,320
Thank you.

870
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,840


871
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:14,460
FUJISAKI YUKARI

872
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:33,700
What are you
doing? Oh, it's windy.

873
01:20:33,701 --> 01:20:34,960
I found it.

874
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,660
You found it.

875
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,260


876
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,780
What's wrong?

877
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,340
It's getting thinner.

878
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,381
I can see the white part clearly.

879
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,480
No, it's not.

880
01:20:50,481 --> 01:20:51,881
You should change the parting line.

881
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:57,500
If you make it the same,
the white part will spread out.

882
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,240
Should I make it like 7-3?

883
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:00,676
I think it's better to divide it like that.

884
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,220
No, you can't make a lot of divisions.

885
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,280
Oh, you don't make divisions?

886
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,500
There are a lot of women.

887
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,660
It's thin.

888
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,100
There's a clinic like that.

889
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,480
Oh, there is.

890
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,580
You don't have to massage.

891
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,360
Oh, is it okay to
massage? Massage.

892
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:17,820
I'll do it.

893
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:19,560


894
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,700
Will it work soon?

895
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,140
No, it won't work soon.

896
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,920
I don't know if it's because
I have the life of a monk.

897
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:29,251
I don't know what to do with three people.

898
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,760
It's hot.

899
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,420
What's up?

900
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,171
I'm thinking of getting a divorce.

901
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:45,470
What's wrong?

902
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,140
I think I should get a
divorce and get a doctor.

903
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,200
I thought I could make time for myself.

904
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,900
Oh, I see.

905
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,641
I'm looking for a good lawyer.

906
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,220
Oh, I see.

907
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,680
Let me know if you find one.

908
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,800
But it's only once in a lifetime.

909
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,300
I think it's good.

910
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:09,780
I envy you.

911
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,020
I want to get a divorce, too.

912
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:15,200
I wish I had some evidence of divorce.

913
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,340
Don't you have one as a husband?

914
01:22:19,341 --> 01:22:22,180
Well, it's a long story, isn't it?

915
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:26,580
It's been a while, but we
don't get together that often.

916
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,120
I see.

917
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,100
Well, I feel like we're back to normal.

918
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,521
You said you wanted
to get a divorce, but

919
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,600
we've been together
for the rest of our lives.

920
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:39,480
I see. You two get along well, don't you?

921
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,740
Hey, hey, hey, Ms. Yukari.

922
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,440
Did you look into the lecture?

923
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,260
I did, and I practiced.

924
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:49,261
I did it!

925
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,030
How was it?

926
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:56,840
In conclusion, it was really good.

927
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:02,160
I was able to do it for the
first time in a long time.

928
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,350
What is that?

929
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,460
I don't understand at all.

930
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,070
Great!

931
01:23:21,145 --> 01:23:22,386
It was good that you taught me.

932
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,380
But I'm glad you didn't.

933
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:26,100
Thank you so much.

934
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,375
I'm a little jealous.

935
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

936
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,041
It's going to be a lot of
trouble for the lawyer.

937
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,040
I know.

938
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,580
I know.

939
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:40,701
I hope we can talk about it.

940
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,700
Like a mud horse marriage.

941
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,760
Mud horse?

942
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,180
We're not in that kind of relationship.

943
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:50,261
It's not like that, really.

944
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:51,820
Well, it's refreshing.

945
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,600
But I still want to take a picture.

946
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,961
Did you have anything
interesting today? Well, yes.

947
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,100


948
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,840
Today,

949
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,740
I talked with my neighbors.

950
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,560
What did you talk about?

951
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:09,680
Did you talk about it?

952
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,560
Yes.

953
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,440
I cut my hair again.

954
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,440
Do you still talk about it?

955
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,020
Yes.

956
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,700
You like to talk about it, don't you?

957
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:23,701
Yes.

958
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:24,860
So,

959
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,640
what did you talk
about? It's a secret.

960
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,670


961
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,120
It's a secret?

962
01:25:32,605 --> 01:25:34,080
But you are talking about it, aren't you?

963
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:35,081
I'm sure you'll remember.

964
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,180
I haven't talked that much.

965
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,700
Just a little.

966
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:43,940
I see.

967
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,520
But if it's that face,

968
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,360
I'm sure it's a good story.

969
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,200
I'm blushing.

970
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:37,787
This is the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had
a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time

971
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:53,340
I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the
first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed, and it's the first time I've ever had a nosebleed

972
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,561
There may be a lot of places
where you haven't kissed yet.

973
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,960
It's a bit perverted.

974
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,460
Then I'll kiss you until
my whole body is numb.

975
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:05,840
Really?

976
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,740
I'll kiss you in the fall, too.

977
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,360
Fall? I'm sweating.

978
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,320


979
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,260
It smells so good.

980
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:45,220
Really?

981
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,660
Did you smell something?

982
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:50,750
I wonder what it is.

983
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,160
Is it shampoo? It's amazing.

984
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,680
Thank you.

985
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,200


986
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:34,194
This is the first time
I've ever seen a cat like

987
01:28:34,206 --> 01:28:42,880
this, and I'm curious
about how it feels to touch it.

988
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:43,900
What?

989
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,700
What is it? Wait a minute.

990
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:47,600


991
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Did I do something
wrong? No, not at all.

992
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,440


993
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,760
Is this a
strawberry? Yes, it is.

994
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,460


995
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,391
Only this part is a strawberry.

996
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,840
Only this part is 3D.

997
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,900
It's 3D.

998
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,620
I thought you would be happy.

999
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,780
I was surprised. It's vivid.

1000
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,540
Show me the back.

1001
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,120
How is the back?

1002
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,820
The back is normal.

1003
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:41,080
You're right.

1004
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,920
You look happy.

1005
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,060
I just wanted to play with you.

1006
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:29,950
You're cuter than usual.

1007
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,490
You're cuter than usual.

1008
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:40,230
That's right.

1009
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,250
Let me see.

1010
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,040
It's the same,
isn't it? It's hot.

1011
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:46,700


1012
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,541
I hear my baby is crying crying.

1013
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,810
It's a little tight.

1014
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:19,410
My baby is getting around my husband's arm.

1015
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:23,630
I can't believe I'm just
looking at my baby.

1016
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,670
I had no idea that the baby was so dirty.

1017
01:35:50,671 --> 01:35:51,671
I'm going to sleep.

1018
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,090
Really?

1019
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:54,450
Yes.

1020
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:55,570
Are you sure?

1021
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:57,030
Yes.

1022
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,210
I'm sure.

1023
01:37:48,070 --> 01:40:00,210
I want you to relax a little.

1024
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:01,211
I want you to feel it.

1025
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,720
Did it hurt?

1026
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:04,770
I want you to feel it slowly.

1027
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,390
Is it in a good
place? It feels good.

1028
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:23,170


1029
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:48,270
Does it feel good,
Kyary? Yes, it does.

1030
01:41:48,810 --> 01:41:51,651
I'm going to take a shower.

1031
01:41:57,970 --> 01:41:59,210
It feels good.

1032
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:08,770
Can I take a bath?

1033
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:44,930
This is amazing.

1034
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,880
I'm going to take a bath.

1035
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:16,440
My friend seems to be in a bad mood, but
I can't help it because it's a good day.

1036
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:16,620
I'm sorry.

1037
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,660
I'm sorry.

1038
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,820
I'm sorry.

1039
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,940
I'm sorry.

1040
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,760
I'm sorry.

1041
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,760
I'm sorry.

1042
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:33,761
I'm sorry.

1043
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:40,640
I'm sorry. Are you
okay? I'm okay.

1044
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:41,900
It feels good.

1045
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:44,340
Wait a minute.

1046
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,380


1047
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,900
I'll take it off.

1048
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,400
Can you do it?

1049
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,360
Gently, gently, gently.

1050
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,080
Are you okay?

1051
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,141
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat play with a ball.

1052
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,060
I'm not sure if it's a good
idea to play with a ball.

1053
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:17,660
I'm not sure if it's a good
idea to play with a ball.

1054
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:20,471
I'm not sure if it's a good
idea to play with a ball.

1055
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:29,680
I'm not sure if it's a good
idea to play with a ball.

1056
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:32,500
Huh?

1057
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,540
Huh?

1058
01:44:33,665 --> 01:44:35,080
Are you going to pull again?

1059
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,680
Yes.

1060
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,540
Wow!

1061
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,200
It's going to be on the back of my head.

1062
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:43,760
Really?

1063
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:46,600
That's very embarrassing.

1064
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:50,200
It's done.

1065
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:05,570
Huh?

1066
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:07,450
Huh?

1067
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,001
My husband is a little
surprised when I touch his neck.

1068
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,460
He's never touched my neck.

1069
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:37,720
But he seems to be interested in my neck.

1070
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:43,660
He plays with my neck,
then he tries to touch it.

1071
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:49,360
Haha.

1072
01:45:49,361 --> 01:45:50,440
You are ticklish.

1073
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,360
You are sensitive now.

1074
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:03,500
Are you blowing?

1075
01:46:04,635 --> 01:46:05,740
You are in the back.

1076
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,120
Girls come out from the back, don't they?

1077
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:24,760
Now...

1078
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,380
You can do it.

1079
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,160
Hey, where are you touching?

1080
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,820
Where are you touching?

1081
01:46:52,821 --> 01:46:53,821
What are you doing?

1082
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:07,320
I'll touch you, too.

1083
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:19,880
I think you should sweat a little.

1084
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:22,661
You'll be a little calmer.

1085
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:36,380
I'm going to take a bath.

1086
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:38,780
Thank you.

1087
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:46,350
Thank you.

1088
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:32,740
It's amazing.

1089
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,100
What?

1090
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:35,900
It looks like it's done.

1091
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:38,860
Really?

1092
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,320
Yes.

1093
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:48,610
It's done.

1094
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:49,860
Really?

1095
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,300
Yes.

1096
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,100
It's blue.

1097
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:57,470
What?

1098
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,560
What?

1099
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,760
What?

1100
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:03,660
What?

1101
01:50:03,661 --> 01:50:07,080
I bought a new hair dryer.

1102
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:11,300
It's been a while since I wore a
dryer, but I'm glad I got a new one.

1103
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,061
How far have you come since then?

1104
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:43,860
I'm a little hungry because
I'm working from now on.

1105
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:58,543
It's been a long time
since I've had a bath, so

1106
01:50:58,555 --> 01:51:07,900
I'm a little tired, but I'm
going to take a break.

1107
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:25,081
I'm going to take a break,
but I'm going to take a break,

1108
01:51:25,093 --> 01:51:31,140
so I'm going to take a break,
so I'm going to take a break.

1109
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,440
It's true.

1110
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:40,540
It's amazing. I can do it again.

1111
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,360
It's true.

1112
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,760
You can put it in here.

1113
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:47,380
What?

1114
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:48,680
You can put it in here.

1115
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:49,760
Here?

1116
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,140
Yes.

1117
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:55,680
Then, I'll take it off.

1118
01:51:55,681 --> 01:51:58,900
No, I don't want to do it here.
It's a pain in the ass.

1119
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,000
I want you to do it in the bath.

1120
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:01,560
What?

1121
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:03,060
I want you to do it here.

1122
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:08,191
But I don't want the baby to come out.

1123
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,720
Then let's think about it at that time.

1124
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:15,280
You did a good
job, didn't you? I see.

1125
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,160
Oh, it's okay.

1126
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:24,240
I'm going to put a
bandage on your arm.

1127
01:52:47,870 --> 01:53:02,100
I'm going to put a bandage on your arm.

1128
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:33,220
It's been a long time since
I've done this kind of exercise.

1129
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:41,551
This time I was able to do it.

1130
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,838
This is the first time
I've had a baby, so I'm a

1131
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:55,836
little nervous, but I'm
sure it's going to be okay.

1132
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:56,100
I'm sure it's going to be okay.

1133
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:57,796
I'm sure it's going to be okay.

1134
01:53:57,820 --> 01:53:58,820
It's OK, isn't it?

1135
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:00,220
Is that so? Oh, I'm tired.

1136
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:04,100
It's ticklish.

1137
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:13,120
Oh, I'm tired.

1138
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:25,020
Hello.

1139
01:54:55,060 --> 01:55:20,900
My name is Michiko
and I'm 12 years old.

1140
01:55:20,901 --> 01:55:22,656
I'm a junior in high school and
I'm currently in my final year.

1141
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:23,680
Me too.

1142
01:55:25,570 --> 01:56:59,110
5th month 7th month

1143
01:56:59,210 --> 01:57:00,210
I'm going to sleep.

1144
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:03,750
I'm going to close the door.

1145
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:19,510
What are you going to do?

1146
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:22,410
Really? I'm fine.

1147
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:24,010


1148
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,818
This is the first time I've
had a baby, so I'm a little

1149
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:21,320
worried, but I'm doing my
best to take care of my baby.

1150
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:30,760
I was surprised when I opened the door.

1151
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,360
I have a lot of things.

1152
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:35,680
I have a lot of things.

1153
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,260
I have a lot of things.

1154
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,620
I have a lot of things.

1155
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:35,650
Tama Zoo, Chimpanzee
It's hot, isn't it?

1156
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:39,450
Do you want me to
hold it for you? It's hot.

1157
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000


1158
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,730
Oh, are you OK? It's hot.

1159
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:48,470


1160
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:49,650
It's hot, isn't it?

1161
01:59:49,690 --> 01:59:50,690
It's hot, isn't it? I'm sorry.

1162
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:52,750


1163
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:04,970
Oh, is it hot? It's hot.

1164
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,650


1165
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:19,140
This is a video of the process
of making a leather belt.

1166
02:01:19,141 --> 02:01:29,780
I will explain how to make a leather belt.

1167
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,420
Do you have any bubbles left?

1168
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,540
Is it OK? OK, that's all.

1169
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:38,280
Thank you.

1170
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:01,020


1171
02:02:36,290 --> 02:03:07,980
This is a video of my son and my
daughter playing in the living room.

1172
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,160
My son and my daughter
are playing in the living room.

1173
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:19,520
It's dry.

1174
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:23,260
Do you want to drink
something? Yes, I do.

1175
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:25,780


1176
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:27,370
What do you want to drink?

1177
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:30,380
What? I don't know.

1178
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,040
Thank you.

1179
02:03:54,085 --> 02:03:55,710
It's good.

1180
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:26,680
It's good.

1181
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:28,940
It's great.

1182
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:32,440


1183
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:42,170
It reminds me of the old days.

1184
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,570
The old days?

1185
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:44,770
When we first met.

1186
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:48,910
When I entered the university.

1187
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,150
At first.

1188
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:53,510
I see.

1189
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,910
I thought you were a kind senior.

1190
02:04:58,590 --> 02:05:00,030
Since that time.

1191
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:01,610
We were in the same circle.

1192
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:06,370
You taught me a lot of things.

1193
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:12,890
I thought you were
different from other girls.

1194
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:15,290
Really?

1195
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,090
I was surprised.

1196
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:17,290
What?

1197
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:25,050
You were the first one to
invite me on a date, right?

1198
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:29,930
Me?

1199
02:05:30,370 --> 02:05:31,370
Yes.

1200
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:43,490
At first, we went to a good
Italian restaurant near our school.

1201
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,041
We went there to have a meal together.

1202
02:05:46,810 --> 02:05:47,810
Yes, that's right.

1203
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:53,110
We met on the way home.

1204
02:05:55,010 --> 02:05:56,570
That restaurant is quite famous.

1205
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,050
I was very excited.

1206
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:02,611
I was surprised when I heard the
news that you were going to be a couple.

1207
02:06:04,910 --> 02:06:06,930
I wonder if they saw it.

1208
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:09,030
I don't know.

1209
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,841
It's a rumor that you're
going to be a couple soon.

1210
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:14,601
I'm looking forward to it.

1211
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:20,290
I think everyone knew it right away.

1212
02:06:20,291 --> 02:06:25,770
I feel like it's been a long
time since we started dating.

1213
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:31,730
I miss that time.

1214
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:42,050
We used to do it a lot.

1215
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:44,430
We were young.

1216
02:06:44,431 --> 02:06:45,431
I didn't know that.

1217
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:50,930
At that time, you weren't
aware of Kougi, were you?

1218
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:54,390
I didn't know at all.

1219
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:01,930
I felt like I was taking a
shower when it was over.

1220
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:04,890
I talked to him a little.

1221
02:07:04,891 --> 02:07:09,637
I was conscious of it when I
was told again by the name of the

1222
02:07:09,649 --> 02:07:14,790
lecture, but I was conscious of it
more than I was conscious of it.

1223
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,910
I thought that I shouldn't do it as it is.

1224
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:27,750
Thank you.

1225
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:36,780
I didn't think you would do it properly.

1226
02:07:37,830 --> 02:07:38,860
Like in the old days?

1227
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:42,800
It's a little different from the old days.

1228
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:54,140
Is my hand long?

1229
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,400
What about me?

1230
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:27,260
Oh, it's bright.

1231
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,000
Oh, you're right.

1232
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:32,820
It's that time already?

1233
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:34,520
Yes.

1234
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:38,160
Do you mean you had a lecture last night?

1235
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Do you mean that?

1236
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:42,480
It's a new record.

1237
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,220
You're right.

1238
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:46,740
Yes.

1239
02:08:47,210 --> 02:08:50,680
I haven't been to a
nightclub in a long time.

1240
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:53,880
It's a new record.

1241
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:02,580
Shall we go to the room?

1242
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:04,180
Yes.

1243
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:20,610
What time is it? I don't know.

1244
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:21,890


1245
02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:24,010
What time is it? It's so bright.

1246
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,410
It's so bright.

1247
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:31,370


1248
02:09:58,270 --> 02:09:59,671
Do you want to do it one more time?

1249
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:41,780
I'm going to try it.

1250
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:25,260
I'm going to try it.

1251
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:29,100
Is it my fault?

1252
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:41,040
I have to go to the bathroom.

1253
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:43,860
I have to go to the bathroom.

1254
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:46,220
What are you doing?

1255
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:48,370
I'm taking a bath.

1256
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:22,670
It's getting cold.

1257
02:12:29,690 --> 02:12:37,040
It's delicious.

1258
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:39,300
You seem to be ready.

1259
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:44,480
Do you want to go home like this?

1260
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:46,040
Yes.

1261
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:49,300
Take your time.

1262
02:13:14,755 --> 02:13:18,891
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh,
ahh, I'm so comfortable.

1263
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:25,390
Ah,

1264
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:29,970
oh,

1265
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:34,290
ah,

1266
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:37,650
Ah, it feels good.

1267
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:40,210
Ah.

1268
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,970
Ah, here.

1269
02:13:42,230 --> 02:13:43,230
Ah.

1270
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:46,330
Ah.

1271
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,021
It's easier to take it from this side.

1272
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:50,550
Ah.

1273
02:13:51,010 --> 02:13:51,510
Really?

1274
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:53,010
Look at my feet.

1275
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:57,810
Ah.

1276
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:58,830
Ah.

1277
02:13:58,831 --> 02:13:59,831
Ah.

1278
02:14:00,710 --> 02:14:01,710
Ah.

1279
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:38,490
Ah~~~~~~~~~

1280
02:14:38,491 --> 02:14:42,911
Ah~~~~~~~~~
Ah~~~~~~~~~ I feel good.

1281
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:46,800


1282
02:14:53,765 --> 02:14:55,230
Ah~~~~~~

1283
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:56,090
Ah~~~~~~

1284
02:14:56,091 --> 02:14:56,650
Ah~~

1285
02:14:57,075 --> 02:14:58,356
But I don't like the other side.

1286
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,370
What?

1287
02:14:59,470 --> 02:15:00,590
I want to do something else.

1288
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:03,770
What? Try to guess.

1289
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:04,910


1290
02:15:05,610 --> 02:15:09,150
Ah~~~~~~ I'm tired.

1291
02:15:09,151 --> 02:15:10,151
It feels good.

1292
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:16,310


1293
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:24,170
It's very tight.

1294
02:15:24,530 --> 02:15:25,530
It feels good.

1295
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:27,790
Does it feel good? Don't move.

1296
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:39,010


1297
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:47,890
I've been trying to make a video
of myself, but I couldn't get it.

1298
02:15:49,970 --> 02:15:50,970
I'm sorry.

1299
02:15:52,810 --> 02:15:53,810
I'm sorry.

1300
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:54,910
I'm sorry.

1301
02:15:55,160 --> 02:16:24,690
When I first met Riki, I tried
to straighten my leg on a chair.

1302
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,890
It's hot, isn't it? It's hot.

1303
02:16:40,970 --> 02:16:42,071
Is it hot?

1304
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:48,050
It's hotter than before.

1305
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:50,390
Yes, it is.

1306
02:16:50,391 --> 02:16:51,391
Already.

1307
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:56,740
It's fine.

1308
02:16:57,770 --> 02:17:05,510
I'm going to hide my face in the mirror.

1309
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:25,700
This video is a derivative work of the
Tohoku Prefecture Tourism Promotion Agency.

1310
02:17:48,290 --> 02:17:49,019
This is the first time
I've had a baby, so I'm

1311
02:17:49,031 --> 02:17:49,756
a little nervous, but
I'm sure it'll be okay.

1312
02:17:49,780 --> 02:18:02,440
I'm sure it's going to be okay.

1313
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:05,660
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1314
02:18:05,661 --> 02:18:12,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1315
02:18:14,060 --> 02:18:20,460
Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...

1316
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:35,900
It's cold, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1317
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:49,040


1318
02:18:50,290 --> 02:19:06,440
It's cold, isn't it?

1319
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,040
Really?

1320
02:19:07,041 --> 02:19:10,980
Give me your hand.

1321
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:40,250
Let me help you.

1322
02:19:42,130 --> 02:19:44,250
It's cold.

1323
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:15,520
I was surprised.

1324
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:30,020
Oh, it came out.

1325
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:33,400
Why did it come out?

1326
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:41,160
It's a great picture.

1327
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:42,880
It's going down.

1328
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,320
I have to wash it later.

1329
02:20:49,970 --> 02:20:51,480
Oh, thank you.

1330
02:20:52,050 --> 02:20:53,050
It's a lot of rice.

1331
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:54,860
It's a lot of rice.

1332
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:57,920
Thank you.

1333
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:58,320
Are you okay? Wait a minute.

1334
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,580


1335
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:06,460
I'll hold it down a little.

1336
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:09,760
Are you okay?

1337
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:10,220
Do you wear underwear?

1338
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,000
No, I don't wear underwear.

1339
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:15,600
Wow, it's amazing.

1340
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:22,420
Tissue?

1341
02:21:25,090 --> 02:21:26,090
It's going to harden.

1342
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:27,940
It's the same as the tissue.

1343
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:20,990
How was it? Did you feel good?

1344
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:23,670
Yes, I felt good.

1345
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:24,550
Really?

1346
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:25,990
Yes.

1347
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:50,780
What?

1348
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:55,520
What should I do?

1349
02:22:55,521 --> 02:22:56,681
It's been a while, hasn't it?

1350
02:22:58,450 --> 02:23:01,040
But I want to stay like this for a while.

1351
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:04,220
Do you want to sleep together?

1352
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,080
Don't you have to take a shower?

1353
02:23:07,170 --> 02:23:08,740
Just a little bit.

1354
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,580
About 5 minutes is fine.

1355
02:23:12,730 --> 02:23:13,730
It's before work.

1356
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:16,000
I have to get ready.

1357
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:17,620
I see.

1358
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:19,800
Then, just a little bit.

1359
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,400
Just a little bit?

1360
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:24,521
Please make a straight face.

1361
02:23:49,805 --> 02:23:56,540
Are you tired?

1362
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:58,160
No, I'm not tired.

1363
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:01,100
Just a little.

1364
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:02,520
Let's take a nap.

1365
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:29,680
Oh, by the way.

1366
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:32,880
It's Friday next week.

1367
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:38,240
I have to finish work a little early.

1368
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,120
Let's go out for a meal sometime.

1369
02:24:48,850 --> 02:24:49,850
Really?

1370
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:50,620
Yes.

1371
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:52,280
Of course.

1372
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:07,640
Well, this way?

1373
02:25:08,060 --> 02:25:09,060
This way?

1374
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:10,980
Well, that's right.

1375
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:13,600
Next Friday.

1376
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:15,520
It's a promise.

1377
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:31,120
Yukari Fujisaki

1378
02:25:41,550 --> 02:25:42,710
Thank you for your hard work.

1379
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:44,100
It must have been hard for you.

1380
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:45,980
I know.

1381
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:49,840
But you did your best.

1382
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:51,800
I envy you.

1383
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:09,510
What's up?

1384
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:14,730
I got a divorce yesterday.

1385
02:26:16,530 --> 02:26:17,570
Congratulations.

1386
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:19,390
I'm so happy.

1387
02:26:21,925 --> 02:26:23,250
I'm happy, too.

1388
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:24,610
I can fly as a woman.

1389
02:26:26,750 --> 02:26:28,130
I'm glad.

1390
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:29,950
I'm rooting for you.

1391
02:26:29,951 --> 02:26:30,951
Thank you.

1392
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:37,950
Hey, did you change your
make-up recently? No, I didn't.

1393
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:42,670
Is there any change?

1394
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:47,150
Well, I was looking at you because I
thought you had a strong skin recently.

1395
02:26:47,870 --> 02:26:48,870
I thought so, too.

1396
02:26:48,990 --> 02:26:49,370
That's right.

1397
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:50,930
Do you do anything?

1398
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:53,650
No, I don't do anything.

1399
02:26:53,651 --> 02:27:02,910
I don't know, but I think I've
been doing it quite a bit recently.

1400
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:04,190
What?

1401
02:27:04,191 --> 02:27:04,630
I've been doing it quite a bit.

1402
02:27:05,170 --> 02:27:06,170
Really? No way! I see.

1403
02:27:06,370 --> 02:27:07,370


1404
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:08,630


1405
02:27:08,730 --> 02:27:09,730
That's why? I think so.

1406
02:27:10,070 --> 02:27:11,070
I see.

1407
02:27:14,490 --> 02:27:15,610


1408
02:27:15,930 --> 02:27:16,990
So, you've been doing it.

1409
02:27:17,790 --> 02:27:18,390
Yes.

1410
02:27:18,391 --> 02:27:19,391
I see.

1411
02:27:20,130 --> 02:27:23,508
For me, it was like, I did it
at the beginning, and then

1412
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,910
I went back to my usual
pace, like I didn't do anything.

1413
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:31,530
It was normal, so I
think it's a good feeling.

1414
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:33,370
I see.

1415
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:43,310
Oh, by the way, it's rare, but that
person invited me to dinner tonight.

1416
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:44,950
After work?

1417
02:27:45,610 --> 02:27:45,990
Is that so?

1418
02:27:45,991 --> 02:27:47,071
We're going to be together.

1419
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:50,070
That's rare.
You always said you wanted to eat at home.

1420
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:54,040
Yes, this is also thanks to Kouki.

1421
02:27:54,750 --> 02:27:55,970
Thank you so much.

1422
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:57,530
It's good to have Kouka.

1423
02:27:59,070 --> 02:28:00,470
I'm a little jealous.

1424
02:28:00,990 --> 02:28:02,590
No, I'll give it to you.

1425
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:04,010
Thank you so much.

1426
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:07,710
From now on, if you're alone, you
can have a meal with three people.

1427
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:09,490
That's great.

1428
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:09,830
That's right.

1429
02:28:09,831 --> 02:28:11,590
It's a girl's cafe.

1430
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:13,050
It's a girl's cafe.

1431
02:28:13,730 --> 02:28:14,730
It's fun.

1432
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:16,190
You two are cute.

1433
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:29,420
I'm sorry.

1434
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:30,840
I'm late.

1435
02:28:32,260 --> 02:28:33,600
I couldn't get out of the car.

1436
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:35,560
I see.

1437
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:37,200
What do you
want to eat? Italian.

1438
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:38,060


1439
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:38,900
Italian? Sounds good.

1440
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:40,080


1441
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,360
It's like our first date.

1442
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:03,390
What did you eat that day?

1443
02:29:04,980 --> 02:29:08,240
I think I ate aglio e olio.

1444
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,780
That's fashionable.

1445
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:12,300
Isn't it? Today.

1446
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:15,960
..

1447
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:17,010
What do you want
to eat? Pasta and.

1448
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:19,800
..

1449
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:21,640
pizza? That's right.

1450
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:23,220


1451
02:29:24,670 --> 02:29:28,810
It's okay to eat garlic.

1452
02:29:28,811 --> 02:29:30,211
It's okay to eat what's in the bag.

1453
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:31,190
Oh, really?

1454
02:29:31,350 --> 02:29:34,390
If you're going to eat it,
it's okay if you two eat it.

1455
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:38,130
I'll kiss you a lot.

1456
02:29:39,085 --> 02:29:40,130
Yeah, sure.

1457
02:29:45,050 --> 02:29:46,210
It was delicious.

1458
02:29:47,290 --> 02:29:48,370
Yeah, it was good.

1459
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:50,730
I'm full.

1460
02:29:51,150 --> 02:29:52,150
Really.

1461
02:29:52,330 --> 02:29:53,330
Yeah.

1462
02:29:54,300 --> 02:29:55,660
It's been a while since I had fun.

1463
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:57,350
Yeah.

1464
02:29:57,450 --> 02:30:00,750
I'm sorry. I don't usually do this to you.

1465
02:30:01,950 --> 02:30:05,130
It's okay. I'm busy.

1466
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:07,450
Invite me again when you have time.

1467
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:10,710
Thank you.

1468
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:21,880
The first shop we went
to was very delicious.

1469
02:30:23,290 --> 02:30:24,290
That's right.

1470
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:27,540
Is that shop still there?
Which one was better?

1471
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,480
I wonder if there is still.

1472
02:30:30,481 --> 02:30:31,641
I wonder if it's still there.

1473
02:30:32,670 --> 02:30:37,700
It's been more than 20 years.

1474
02:30:40,100 --> 02:30:41,500
It's a miracle if it's still there.

1475
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:44,160
But the chef may have changed.

1476
02:30:44,980 --> 02:30:46,340
I wonder if the taste will change.

1477
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:49,200
I miss it.

1478
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:52,800
Because I couldn't go at that time.

1479
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:54,240
That's right.

1480
02:30:57,355 --> 02:30:59,400
But now that I think about
it, I wonder if it was like this.

1481
02:30:59,401 --> 02:31:00,401
I think so.

1482
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:06,640
When I was a student, I
thought it was very delicious.

1483
02:31:08,610 --> 02:31:10,420
I made money and
became a member of society.

1484
02:31:12,330 --> 02:31:14,700
I ate it with everyone and
said, It was delicious here.

1485
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:18,620
Did everyone agree with you?

1486
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:19,900
Yes.

1487
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:21,440
That's right.

1488
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:26,180
Did I eat too much delicious food?

1489
02:31:26,181 --> 02:31:27,181
I wonder if it's gone.

1490
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:30,620
But you know, you can update it again.

1491
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,200
Yeah.

1492
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:35,480
So let's look for a lot of good
restaurants together again.

1493
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Yeah, that's right.

1494
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:56,460
Today,

1495
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:58,560
After this,

1496
02:32:59,385 --> 02:33:01,185
I'll ask you to go out
with me a little more.

1497
02:33:33,590 --> 02:33:34,670
Kouki, Yeah.

1498
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:36,891
Yes.

1499
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:42,660
Was it the right answer?

1500
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:45,620
The right answer?

1501
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:47,660
Was there anything you were glad about?

1502
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:59,970
Well, until the morning,

1503
02:34:02,290 --> 02:34:06,910
I talked about memories all night.

1504
02:34:08,250 --> 02:34:09,290
You talked about
memories? All night long.

1505
02:34:09,870 --> 02:34:11,010


1506
02:34:11,290 --> 02:34:13,290
In the living room.

1507
02:34:13,291 --> 02:34:18,490
I was wondering if that would happen, too.

1508
02:34:18,730 --> 02:34:19,730
I see.

1509
02:34:21,890 --> 02:34:26,010
I don't know the correct
answer, but it was fun.

1510
02:34:27,270 --> 02:34:28,270
I see.

1511
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,980
It's a two-way race.

1512
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:42,280
It's fun to find it.

1513
02:34:42,281 --> 02:34:43,281
It's fun, isn't it?

1514
02:34:48,210 --> 02:34:50,570
It's a little hard to go out
every day until the morning.

1515
02:34:52,370 --> 02:34:53,690
It's a little hard.

1516
02:34:57,230 --> 02:34:59,850
But sometimes we have a day off.

1517
02:35:02,570 --> 02:35:04,810
Sometimes we have a day off.

1518
02:35:04,811 --> 02:35:18,180
What do you do when you
don't wear clothes all day?

1519
02:35:18,181 --> 02:35:19,941
What do you do on days
when you can't sleep?

1520
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:25,740
What do you do when you can't stop?

1521
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:31,480
I don't stop until morning.

1522
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:34,780
That's amazing.

1523
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:36,640
I don't wear clothes.

1524
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:39,620
I don't wear clothes all day.

1525
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:41,520
You're always flirting.

1526
02:35:41,521 --> 02:35:41,900
I wash my face,

1527
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:46,000
I eat on the bed,

1528
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,240
I do laundry on the way,

1529
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:57,800
I do cleaning on the way,

1530
02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:02,240
I do cleaning on the way,

1531
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:05,901
I do cleaning on the
way, What are you doing?

1532
02:36:08,860 --> 02:36:44,990
It's so beautiful.

1533
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:50,510
Ta-da! I did my best.

1534
02:36:51,105 --> 02:36:52,630


1535
02:36:53,710 --> 02:36:54,950
Wow!

1536
02:36:56,425 --> 02:36:57,650
Did you hear that?

1537
02:36:58,030 --> 02:36:59,030
Yes.

1538
02:37:00,310 --> 02:37:01,310
It's amazing.

1539
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:05,151
It's like... Isn't it that?

1540
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:08,430
Isn't it the newlywed travel
to Hawaii? That may be so.

1541
02:37:12,170 --> 02:37:13,170


1542
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:17,180
What is this?

1543
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:19,970
What is this?

1544
02:37:22,230 --> 02:37:26,170
I think this is also a free plan.

1545
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:27,950
Is that so? Wow! It's cute.

1546
02:37:28,530 --> 02:37:29,530


1547
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:32,370


1548
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:36,150
You can drink whatever
you want in the refrigerator.

1549
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:36,990
Really?

1550
02:37:37,530 --> 02:37:37,610
Yes.

1551
02:37:37,950 --> 02:37:40,210
It usually costs a lot
of money, doesn't it?

1552
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:41,430
Yes.

1553
02:37:41,770 --> 02:37:44,211
Refrigerator... Here? Oh, I see.

1554
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:45,970


1555
02:37:47,130 --> 02:37:47,850
There are a lot of things in it.

1556
02:37:48,150 --> 02:37:49,150
Yes.

1557
02:37:49,810 --> 02:37:50,810
Oh, great.

1558
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:52,770
Oh, that object.

1559
02:38:03,060 --> 02:38:04,060
Great.

1560
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:05,520
Yes.

1561
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:06,940
I've never stayed in a place like this.

1562
02:38:06,941 --> 02:38:07,220
I've never seen it.

1563
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:08,840
No, I haven't.

1564
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:11,800
Was it expensive?

1565
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:18,470
Well, let's not talk about that.

1566
02:38:19,350 --> 02:38:20,350
Let's leave it.

1567
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:24,890
Hey, it's trash day tomorrow.

1568
02:38:25,750 --> 02:38:27,070
I can't carry the cardboard.

1569
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:30,510
Can you do something
difficult for me? Let's see.

1570
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:32,070


1571
02:38:33,630 --> 02:38:34,630
But,

1572
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:38,010
It's already 10 o'clock.

1573
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:40,360
Oh, I see.

1574
02:38:40,570 --> 02:38:41,690
It's already been collected.

1575
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:43,370
Yes, it is.

1576
02:38:43,790 --> 02:38:45,590
I think it will be
collected until next week.

1577
02:38:47,310 --> 02:38:49,130
Yes, it was a bad timing.

1578
02:38:50,250 --> 02:38:51,510
Well, it doesn't matter.

1579
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:52,830
It doesn't matter.

1580
02:38:57,205 --> 02:38:59,770
Oh, did I turn off the gas generator?

1581
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:04,770
Did I turn it off? I don't know.

1582
02:39:06,695 --> 02:39:07,695
I'm fine.

1583
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:11,110
I see. I'm worried about you.

1584
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:13,170
But you're always fine.

1585
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:15,910
Yes, you're right.

1586
02:39:21,100 --> 02:39:22,190
Are you nervous? No, I'm not.

1587
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:23,930


1588
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:24,850
Really?

1589
02:39:25,240 --> 02:39:27,450
I'm not used to this kind of place.

1590
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:29,750
So I'm a little nervous.

1591
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:34,230
I see.

1592
02:39:34,590 --> 02:39:34,850
Yes.

1593
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:38,930
Do you want to take a
shower? It's a hassle.

1594
02:39:41,750 --> 02:39:42,810


1595
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:44,270
What?

1596
02:39:44,770 --> 02:39:45,770
It's a hassle?

1597
02:39:46,030 --> 02:39:46,250
Yes.

1598
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,840
You're a grown-up now.

1599
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:51,050
Because you're old.

1600
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:53,810
Oh, really?

1601
02:39:54,270 --> 02:39:55,750
I'll be cute if I become like that.

1602
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:57,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

1603
02:39:57,250 --> 02:39:58,250
No, no, no.

1604
02:39:58,290 --> 02:39:59,570
I was just trying to relax.

1605
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:01,770
Oh, really?

1606
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:03,210
Yes.

1607
02:40:03,290 --> 02:40:04,290
Then say you're cute.

1608
02:40:06,510 --> 02:40:07,510
You are cute.

1609
02:40:08,650 --> 02:40:09,650
Thank you.

1610
02:40:10,610 --> 02:40:11,890
You are the cutest in the world.

1611
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:13,430
In the world? Thank you.

1612
02:40:14,110 --> 02:40:15,110


1613
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:24,820
Did I hurt you?

1614
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:26,120
What?

1615
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:30,020
What's wrong with
you? No, I'm fine.

1616
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:32,760


1617
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:34,020
Are you sure?

1618
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:36,180
Yes.

1619
02:40:59,230 --> 02:41:00,830
I'm really nervous in a place like this.

1620
02:41:02,810 --> 02:41:03,810
But it's wonderful.

1621
02:41:06,130 --> 02:41:07,130
I'm very happy.

1622
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:09,660
Thank you.

1623
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:20,110
Thank you for being with me.

1624
02:41:23,230 --> 02:41:24,230
That's right.

1625
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:27,160
It's been 20 years.

1626
02:41:27,610 --> 02:41:28,610
That's right.

1627
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:30,570
20 years is early.

1628
02:41:30,571 --> 02:41:31,571
I see.

1629
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:35,350
How often did you
come with me? 20 years.

1630
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:39,190
I didn't imagine that.

1631
02:41:40,130 --> 02:41:40,890
What?

1632
02:41:40,995 --> 02:41:43,430
I didn't imagine that I
would be with you for so long.

1633
02:41:45,060 --> 02:41:46,956
Did you think we would break up
at an earlier stage? No, not at all.

1634
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:49,330
I couldn't imagine
it for 20 years.

1635
02:41:49,710 --> 02:41:51,210
I didn't know if I was alive or not.

1636
02:41:53,090 --> 02:41:54,730
But we were together.

1637
02:41:55,070 --> 02:41:56,070
Yes.

1638
02:41:56,210 --> 02:41:57,210
What?

1639
02:42:12,065 --> 02:42:14,065
Where do you want to go
when you are 30 years old?

1640
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:15,520
Abroad?

1641
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:18,340
Do you want to go?

1642
02:42:18,380 --> 02:42:19,380
Yes.

1643
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,840
How about 40 years?

1644
02:42:26,580 --> 02:42:28,290
40 years? Do you want to go to space?

1645
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:30,510
Do you want to go?

1646
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:33,970
I think I can go there.

1647
02:42:34,270 --> 02:42:35,490
I think so, too.

1648
02:42:36,470 --> 02:42:37,910
Then, let's stay together forever.

1649
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:14,050
What's going on
over there? Bedroom.

1650
02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:16,850


1651
02:43:17,910 --> 02:43:19,330
Let's go to bed.

1652
02:43:20,970 --> 02:43:22,770
Let's go.

1653
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:44,340
It's so beautiful.

1654
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:47,420
Let's take a look.

1655
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:54,020
Wow, it's so beautiful.

1656
02:44:00,440 --> 02:44:10,680
When I look at the night
view, I can't help but cry.

1657
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:12,380
Tears?

1658
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:15,540
I think I'm getting older.

1659
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:17,090
What?

1660
02:44:21,010 --> 02:44:22,650
When I see something beautiful like this.

1661
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:27,420
I'm impressed.

1662
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:29,320
Yes.

1663
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:32,680
I see.

1664
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:35,520
But I wonder if I can look at it forever.

1665
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:43,800
I feel like I'm in a place
I've been to before.

1666
02:44:43,801 --> 02:44:44,881
I feel like I'm in a video.

1667
02:44:45,900 --> 02:44:46,900
Video?

1668
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:48,160
Yes.

1669
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,060
Thank you.

1670
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:43,300
You look great today.

1671
02:45:43,900 --> 02:45:44,900
Yes.

1672
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:52,270
Did you buy something
for today? Yes, I did.

1673
02:45:52,810 --> 02:45:54,090
For you.

1674
02:45:54,330 --> 02:45:55,710


1675
02:45:57,250 --> 02:45:57,890
You look so cute.

1676
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,610
Thank you.

1677
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:04,650
I love pink tie.

1678
02:46:18,190 --> 02:46:42,260
What should I do with this?

1679
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:44,460
Do something?

1680
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:46,360
Yes.

1681
02:46:50,430 --> 02:46:53,980
I'm kidding.

1682
02:46:53,981 --> 02:46:54,981
Really?

1683
02:46:56,730 --> 02:47:05,270
I don't hate it.

1684
02:47:05,970 --> 02:47:06,130
Really? Just a little.

1685
02:47:06,630 --> 02:47:08,530
Just a little.

1686
02:47:09,970 --> 02:47:10,970


1687
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:13,150
I just played with it.

1688
02:47:14,030 --> 02:47:15,030
Well, next time.

1689
02:47:16,710 --> 02:47:17,710
Yes, next time.

1690
02:47:18,190 --> 02:47:19,270
Let's try it.

1691
02:47:19,271 --> 02:47:20,271


1692
02:48:02,070 --> 02:48:03,190
This clothes is very erotic.

1693
02:48:03,430 --> 02:48:03,570
What?

1694
02:48:04,170 --> 02:48:05,170
Yes.

1695
02:48:19,180 --> 02:48:20,500
I was wondering.

1696
02:48:39,470 --> 02:48:40,830
Have you ever seen this underwear?

1697
02:48:41,990 --> 02:48:42,330
Yes.

1698
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:43,970
It's a new underwear.

1699
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:50,400
I see.

1700
02:48:50,880 --> 02:48:51,880
Can I wear it today?

1701
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:53,200
Yes.

1702
02:48:53,550 --> 02:48:55,000
Are you happy? Of course I am.

1703
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:58,080
You look great.

1704
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:03,760
Thank you.

1705
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:05,140


1706
02:49:11,140 --> 02:49:11,810
Do you need this?

1707
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:13,010
Yes.

1708
02:49:13,150 --> 02:49:14,330
It fits the image of Yukari.

1709
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:16,630
Thank you.

1710
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:21,251
But this... What?

1711
02:49:21,890 --> 02:49:22,890
What?

1712
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:24,870
Isn't this too tight?

1713
02:49:24,871 --> 02:49:25,470
It's too aggressive, isn't it?

1714
02:49:25,530 --> 02:49:26,530
Too aggressive?

1715
02:49:26,790 --> 02:49:27,790
Is it?

1716
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:30,470
Hmm...

1717
02:49:30,870 --> 02:49:31,870
Wow...

1718
02:49:35,150 --> 02:49:37,430
The shop staff told me that
this is a fighting underwear.

1719
02:49:39,090 --> 02:49:40,110
Really?

1720
02:49:40,430 --> 02:49:41,430
Yes.

1721
02:49:44,250 --> 02:49:45,270
Awesome.

1722
02:49:45,970 --> 02:49:46,390
Awesome?

1723
02:49:46,650 --> 02:49:47,650
Yes.

1724
02:49:50,630 --> 02:49:51,650
Awesome.

1725
02:49:52,210 --> 02:49:53,210
Yes.

1726
02:49:58,250 --> 02:50:00,450
I bought it because you said
you wanted to play a game.

1727
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:02,730
I didn't know you asked me.

1728
02:50:10,390 --> 02:50:11,830
So, today is the day to play a game.

1729
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:32,340
I'm normal. Are you okay?

1730
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:33,760
What about my
game pants? It's okay.

1731
02:50:33,761 --> 02:50:41,020
I like this.

1732
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:41,960
Really?

1733
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:43,300
Yes.

1734
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:46,040
Are you okay?

1735
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:47,420
Yes.

1736
02:50:52,190 --> 02:50:58,050
Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay.

1737
02:50:58,450 --> 02:50:59,790
Oh, yes.

1738
02:51:04,390 --> 02:51:05,390


1739
02:51:10,850 --> 02:51:14,050
This is the first time I've ever
seen such a large bed in my life.

1740
02:51:14,051 --> 02:51:16,590
It's a big bed, isn't it?

1741
02:51:17,320 --> 02:51:18,320
Where is it?

1742
02:51:25,090 --> 02:51:27,570
The pillow is big,
isn't it? My butt is big.

1743
02:51:29,010 --> 02:51:30,010
Thank you.

1744
02:51:30,230 --> 02:51:32,130
You said your butt is big.

1745
02:51:33,070 --> 02:51:33,350
What?

1746
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:34,670
You said your butt is big.

1747
02:51:35,550 --> 02:51:37,350
I love you.

1748
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:41,290
It's a pillow fight.

1749
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:43,610
If I throw a pillow, you'll get angry.

1750
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:45,330
That's right. You'll get angry.

1751
02:51:46,730 --> 02:51:47,730
Let's go.

1752
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:07,190
Wow, it's so soft.

1753
02:52:07,630 --> 02:52:08,870
Yes, it is.

1754
02:52:08,871 --> 02:52:11,030
It's so soft.

1755
02:52:13,250 --> 02:52:15,930
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

1756
02:52:17,090 --> 02:52:19,810


1757
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:26,750
I hit something.

1758
02:52:35,610 --> 02:52:41,530
「」「せっかくの新しいヤツに裏切られちゃった。」
「うるさくて」 It's hard.

1759
02:54:05,910 --> 02:54:07,160


1760
02:54:08,060 --> 02:54:09,060
What? It's very hard.

1761
02:54:09,720 --> 02:54:10,720


1762
02:54:10,980 --> 02:54:11,980
Is it hard?

1763
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:55,280
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's so cute.

1764
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:57,740
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

1765
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:00,800
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

1766
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:19,250
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

1767
02:56:10,490 --> 02:56:12,620
Today is the day when I will start eating.

1768
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:25,760
I'm not good at eating
out, but I try to take it.

1769
02:56:25,761 --> 02:56:28,361
I always think that eating and
sleeping are two different things.

1770
02:56:37,800 --> 02:56:41,200
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1771
02:56:43,560 --> 02:56:55,840
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1772
02:56:56,070 --> 02:56:58,080
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1773
02:57:03,910 --> 02:57:06,160
Oh, wait a minute.

1774
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:07,700
What's wrong?

1775
02:57:08,180 --> 02:57:10,440
I felt so good just now.

1776
02:57:11,480 --> 02:57:11,840
Really? Yeah.

1777
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:12,980


1778
02:57:14,310 --> 02:57:16,120
The pillow is too low.

1779
02:57:16,740 --> 02:57:17,740
Yeah.

1780
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:19,836
I think it's better to
put it on the pillow.

1781
02:57:19,860 --> 02:57:20,860
OK.

1782
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:22,520
Where? Here.

1783
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:23,940


1784
02:57:24,990 --> 02:57:26,500
How do you feel? I feel good.

1785
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:27,820


1786
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:30,160
You feel too good.

1787
02:57:30,980 --> 02:57:31,980
Should I stop?

1788
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:33,920
I feel too good.

1789
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:36,340
What should I do?

1790
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:37,860
What should I do?

1791
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:39,660
Should I be a little
gentle? That's right.

1792
02:57:40,660 --> 02:57:41,660


1793
02:57:55,740 --> 02:58:26,960
ああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああ

1794
02:59:34,100 --> 02:59:35,740
It's a very loud sound.

1795
02:59:38,300 --> 02:59:40,940
I feel it more than usual.

1796
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:42,600
Really?

1797
02:59:43,460 --> 03:00:19,230
I'm glad if you enjoy this video.

1798
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:20,890
Oh my god.

1799
03:00:20,950 --> 03:00:21,950
Oh my god.

1800
03:00:31,720 --> 03:00:33,380
Can I lick you?

1801
03:00:38,930 --> 03:00:40,100
Are you okay?

1802
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:41,340
What should I do?

1803
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:42,620
This way? It's fluffy.

1804
03:00:44,330 --> 03:00:45,330


1805
03:00:48,770 --> 03:00:50,640
It's really fluffy.

1806
03:00:50,641 --> 03:00:50,960
It's hot, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1807
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:53,080


1808
03:01:18,080 --> 03:01:20,320
This is a video of me and
my husband playing with a cat.

1809
03:01:27,300 --> 03:01:27,640
I'm not used to this kind of
video, so I'm a little nervous.

1810
03:01:28,220 --> 03:01:29,840
I'm not used to this kind of
video, so I'm a little nervous.

1811
03:01:29,841 --> 03:01:31,820
I'm not used to this kind of
video, so I'm a little nervous.

1812
03:01:31,821 --> 03:01:32,821
Hey.

1813
03:01:44,820 --> 03:01:45,820
It's not your business.

1814
03:01:46,100 --> 03:01:47,100
It's not your business?

1815
03:01:47,820 --> 03:01:48,880
Don't get dirty.

1816
03:02:07,835 --> 03:02:09,570
It feels really good.

1817
03:02:28,100 --> 03:02:51,360
I'm sorry I'm not good at speaking English.

1818
03:02:51,480 --> 03:02:53,200
I'm sorry I'm not good at speaking English.

1819
03:02:57,670 --> 03:03:01,760
I'm having a hard time with my teeth.

1820
03:03:01,965 --> 03:03:02,965
It's so bad today.

1821
03:03:05,050 --> 03:03:06,520
It's so bad that it's full.

1822
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:10,040
There's a lot in my mouth.

1823
03:03:11,225 --> 03:03:12,900
Don't you have teeth?

1824
03:03:12,950 --> 03:03:13,950
Don't you feel any pain?

1825
03:03:15,880 --> 03:03:17,680
I don't feel any pain at all.

1826
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:24,720
Is your jaw tired?

1827
03:03:26,010 --> 03:03:27,260
Yes, just a little.

1828
03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:29,120
Because it's big.

1829
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:36,500
Oh, my God.

1830
03:03:37,310 --> 03:03:38,310
It feels good.

1831
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:45,530
Oh, no.

1832
03:03:45,910 --> 03:03:46,910
Oh, no?

1833
03:03:47,270 --> 03:03:48,090
It's coming out.

1834
03:03:48,250 --> 03:03:49,250
It's coming out? No.

1835
03:03:50,050 --> 03:03:50,430
No?

1836
03:03:50,590 --> 03:03:51,590
No.

1837
03:03:51,790 --> 03:03:53,710
Not this way.

1838
03:03:55,450 --> 03:03:57,030
But it feels so good.

1839
03:04:00,150 --> 03:04:01,790
Oh, no.

1840
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:07,030
Well, then.

1841
03:04:14,410 --> 03:04:15,370
I'm sorry.

1842
03:04:15,371 --> 03:04:15,410
Ah.

1843
03:04:16,010 --> 03:04:18,950
It's hot.

1844
03:04:19,190 --> 03:04:20,190
Ah.

1845
03:04:20,990 --> 03:04:21,990
Ah.

1846
03:04:23,130 --> 03:04:24,130
Ah.

1847
03:04:24,210 --> 03:04:25,210
It's okay.

1848
03:04:25,805 --> 03:04:27,950
What about the ball?

1849
03:04:28,690 --> 03:04:29,690
Ah.

1850
03:04:30,630 --> 03:04:32,710
It's in my bag.

1851
03:04:34,330 --> 03:04:35,330
I don't like it.

1852
03:04:35,410 --> 03:04:38,790
If it's stuck here, I
don't want to take it off.

1853
03:04:40,270 --> 03:04:41,170
Then, put it in this bag.

1854
03:04:41,171 --> 03:04:42,291
Do you want me to put it in?

1855
03:04:43,030 --> 03:04:44,030
Yes.

1856
03:04:46,330 --> 03:04:47,330
Wow.

1857
03:04:49,450 --> 03:04:50,450
Isn't it melting? It's melting.

1858
03:04:51,150 --> 03:04:52,150


1859
03:04:52,840 --> 03:04:54,890
If it melts, it will disappear.

1860
03:04:55,790 --> 03:04:56,790
Wow.

1861
03:04:56,990 --> 03:04:57,990
It's melting.

1862
03:04:58,310 --> 03:04:59,810
Is it melting?

1863
03:05:01,480 --> 03:05:02,480
It's easy to put it in.

1864
03:05:04,280 --> 03:05:05,280
Can I put it in?

1865
03:05:12,970 --> 03:05:14,140
Ah...

1866
03:05:19,130 --> 03:05:21,720
Ah... Ah...

1867
03:05:24,360 --> 03:05:25,520
You have gone very far.

1868
03:05:32,875 --> 03:05:33,875
I feel good.

1869
03:05:35,190 --> 03:05:36,250
Ah...

1870
03:05:38,940 --> 03:05:40,930
Ah...

1871
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:42,590
Ah...

1872
03:05:48,470 --> 03:05:51,401
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1873
03:05:52,970 --> 03:05:54,680
Oh, it's very red.

1874
03:05:58,580 --> 03:05:59,580
Can I put it this deep?

1875
03:06:03,530 --> 03:06:05,120
It's rubbing a lot.

1876
03:06:08,580 --> 03:06:09,960
It feels good.

1877
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:16,920
Do you like this? I love it.

1878
03:06:18,310 --> 03:06:19,310
It feels good.

1879
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:22,440
It's amazing.

1880
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:24,800
That's it.

1881
03:06:26,140 --> 03:06:27,140


1882
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:28,560
This?

1883
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:30,040
This? That's it.

1884
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:31,760
That's amazing.

1885
03:06:45,445 --> 03:06:47,440


1886
03:06:48,700 --> 03:06:49,700
Here?

1887
03:06:52,300 --> 03:06:53,020
Ah!

1888
03:06:53,220 --> 03:06:54,220
How do you feel,
Ikari? I feel good.

1889
03:06:54,860 --> 03:06:56,140


1890
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:57,600
I feel like I'm in my stomach.

1891
03:06:58,460 --> 03:06:59,720
In my stomach.

1892
03:06:59,960 --> 03:07:00,960
Ah, I see.

1893
03:07:11,270 --> 03:07:12,760
I can't say anything.

1894
03:07:25,260 --> 03:07:26,900
Oh, that's right.

1895
03:07:28,110 --> 03:07:29,460
You have the deepest one now.

1896
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:36,360
I knew it.

1897
03:08:13,810 --> 03:08:14,943
Today, I'm going to show
you a video of my cat,

1898
03:08:14,955 --> 03:08:16,246
Sukude, who was caught
by the owner of the cat tower.

1899
03:08:16,270 --> 03:08:17,750
The owner of the cat tower, Sukude,
was caught by the owner of the cat tower.

1900
03:08:17,751 --> 03:08:18,751
Oh, dear.

1901
03:08:20,440 --> 03:08:22,870
Oh, it's too wet.

1902
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:25,500
You touched my belly.

1903
03:08:26,570 --> 03:08:28,210
Please be gentle, my dear.

1904
03:08:29,470 --> 03:08:30,770
Not yet.

1905
03:08:32,630 --> 03:08:34,510
Do you feel tired, staying
on bed all the time? A little bit.

1906
03:08:34,710 --> 03:08:35,910


1907
03:08:38,980 --> 03:08:40,100
Well, I'm going to lie down.

1908
03:08:44,790 --> 03:08:47,190
Good night.

1909
03:08:47,890 --> 03:08:48,370
Good night.

1910
03:08:48,371 --> 03:08:49,371
Good night.

1911
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:19,236
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's been

1912
03:09:19,248 --> 03:09:23,010
a long time since I've seen a
cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

1913
03:09:38,050 --> 03:09:40,299
I'm not sure if it's because
it's been a long time since

1914
03:09:40,311 --> 03:09:42,410
I've seen a cat like this,
but I'm a little nervous.

1915
03:09:56,905 --> 03:09:58,690
I'm sorry.

1916
03:10:02,900 --> 03:10:03,970
I'm sorry.

1917
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:09,710
I'm sorry.

1918
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:14,370
Put your legs straight.

1919
03:10:33,110 --> 03:10:36,110
It feels good.

1920
03:10:38,590 --> 03:10:40,810
It feels good.

1921
03:10:58,590 --> 03:11:00,910
Today, I'm going to show you
how to get rid of bad breath.

1922
03:11:03,490 --> 03:11:05,530
I'm going to show you
how to get rid of bad breath.

1923
03:11:05,750 --> 03:11:08,350
I'm going to show you
how to get rid of bad breath.

1924
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:12,130
I'm going to show you
how to get rid of bad breath.

1925
03:11:12,520 --> 03:11:14,560
I'm going to show you
how to get rid of bad breath.

1926
03:11:18,310 --> 03:11:20,290
It's like a vacuum cleaner.

1927
03:11:20,990 --> 03:11:21,990
It's amazing.

1928
03:11:28,590 --> 03:11:33,430
Here, do you
see this? This is it.

1929
03:11:34,620 --> 03:11:35,710


1930
03:11:36,690 --> 03:11:37,690
What is that?

1931
03:11:38,050 --> 03:11:39,070
What is that? I don't know.

1932
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:40,570


1933
03:11:40,990 --> 03:11:42,210
It's a good place.

1934
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:44,160
It's amazing.

1935
03:11:47,070 --> 03:11:50,630
It's terrible.

1936
03:11:53,610 --> 03:11:56,680
It's terrible.

1937
03:13:37,460 --> 03:13:39,970
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

1938
03:13:40,730 --> 03:13:41,410
It's been a long time since
I've seen a cat like this.

1939
03:13:41,411 --> 03:13:41,550
It's been a long time since
I've seen a cat like this.

1940
03:13:42,250 --> 03:13:44,410
It's been a long time since
I've seen a cat like this.

1941
03:13:45,190 --> 03:13:45,650
It's been a long time since
I've seen a cat like this.

1942
03:13:46,070 --> 03:13:47,070
Are you okay? I can't sleep.

1943
03:13:49,320 --> 03:13:51,010


1944
03:13:51,450 --> 03:13:52,930
You can't sleep? I can't sleep.

1945
03:13:53,370 --> 03:13:54,370
Oh, my God.

1946
03:14:21,825 --> 03:14:22,850


1947
03:14:23,230 --> 03:14:24,790
Oh, it feels good.

1948
03:14:33,290 --> 03:14:34,290
It feels good there.

1949
03:14:38,330 --> 03:14:39,640
Oh, my God.

1950
03:14:40,730 --> 03:14:43,060
Oh, but it feels good to
rub the tip of my nose.

1951
03:15:00,670 --> 03:15:01,670
Oh, my God.

1952
03:15:13,900 --> 03:15:14,850
Oh, it hurts.

1953
03:15:14,851 --> 03:15:16,850
I'm going to sleep.

1954
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:19,190
I'm going to sleep.

1955
03:15:19,330 --> 03:15:20,330
I'm going to sleep.

1956
03:15:21,270 --> 03:15:22,310
I'm going to sleep.

1957
03:15:22,450 --> 03:15:23,930
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

1958
03:15:25,230 --> 03:15:26,710
What should I do?

1959
03:15:27,350 --> 03:15:29,030
A different place than usual.

1960
03:15:33,220 --> 03:15:34,380
A different place than usual?

1961
03:15:34,910 --> 03:15:35,910
Yes.

1962
03:15:36,910 --> 03:15:37,910
What?

1963
03:15:39,220 --> 03:15:40,530
A place I've never been.

1964
03:15:47,700 --> 03:15:49,090
Your face...

1965
03:15:49,440 --> 03:15:53,930
But your make-up is going to be messed up.

1966
03:15:57,055 --> 03:16:00,090
I don't care.
I'm going to wash my face and go to bed.

1967
03:16:02,290 --> 03:16:03,890
I don't care. I'm going to wash my face.

1968
03:16:06,265 --> 03:16:07,305
I've never done it before.

1969
03:16:09,810 --> 03:16:10,970
Let's do it.

1970
03:16:11,870 --> 03:16:15,010
It's not good if you put it in your mouth.

1971
03:16:16,430 --> 03:16:17,670
I'm closing my mouth.

1972
03:16:58,620 --> 03:17:00,140
I'm going to rub your neck a lot.

1973
03:17:04,340 --> 03:17:08,000
Oh, it feels good.

1974
03:17:51,150 --> 03:17:52,300
Oh, my God!

1975
03:17:54,080 --> 03:18:01,660
Oh, my God!

1976
03:18:01,661 --> 03:18:02,861
I'm going to have a hard time.

1977
03:18:04,020 --> 03:18:05,220
I'm going to have a hard time.

1978
03:18:13,760 --> 03:18:22,280
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

1979
03:18:35,010 --> 03:18:36,591
Are you okay?

1980
03:18:37,310 --> 03:18:38,310
Are you okay? Oh, my God.

1981
03:18:38,410 --> 03:18:39,410


1982
03:18:41,350 --> 03:18:43,230
You have a mosquito bite.

1983
03:18:43,570 --> 03:18:44,610
Do I have a mosquito
bite? I can't see.

1984
03:18:45,690 --> 03:18:46,950
I can't see.

1985
03:18:48,370 --> 03:18:49,370
I'm sorry.

1986
03:18:50,230 --> 03:18:51,450
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1987
03:18:51,750 --> 03:18:53,470


1988
03:18:53,990 --> 03:18:55,630
Wait, what's going on?

1989
03:18:57,170 --> 03:18:58,170
Is it serious?

1990
03:18:59,510 --> 03:19:00,510
Yes.

1991
03:19:10,310 --> 03:19:12,230
Wait a minute.

1992
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:13,770
Can't you see?

1993
03:19:16,410 --> 03:19:18,810
Hold it for a moment.

1994

This is a video of a child who
had a lot of food on the floor.

1999
03:19:50,515 --> 03:19:52,235
A child who has a lot of food on her mouth.

2000
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:00,720
Oh, it didn't go into my mouth.

2001
03:20:02,190 --> 03:20:03,280
It was dripping here.

2002
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:05,920
Did you know it was dripping?

2003
03:20:06,020 --> 03:20:07,700
It was dripping. My stomach was throbbing.

2004
03:20:08,660 --> 03:20:10,980
A shooting star was flowing.

2005
03:20:13,430 --> 03:20:14,430
I don't know.

2006
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:18,020
I forgot to say shooting star or wish.

2007
03:20:26,100 --> 03:20:27,380
But it seems to be okay.

2008
03:20:27,780 --> 03:20:30,600
Are you okay?

2009
03:20:35,310 --> 03:20:36,580
What did you want
to ask me? Well.

2010
03:20:39,980 --> 03:20:41,420
..

2011
03:20:42,470 --> 03:20:44,070
Can we be together until 50 years later?

2012
03:20:47,565 --> 03:20:49,165
Can we be together
until 50 years later? Well.

2013
03:20:51,320 --> 03:20:52,080
..

2014
03:20:52,081 --> 03:20:54,160
It's said that life is 90 years.

2015
03:20:54,960 --> 03:20:56,180
90 years is not 100 years.

2016
03:20:59,490 --> 03:21:01,730
Do you want to live with me until
you are 100 years old? Yes, I do.

2017
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:04,420
I wonder if I can live with you.

2018
03:21:05,875 --> 03:21:07,420
Then let's live together for 60 years.

2019
03:21:24,625 --> 03:21:28,150
Let's live together for 60 years.

2020
03:21:30,320 --> 03:21:32,160
If you die before me,
it's definitely no good.

2021
03:21:33,110 --> 03:21:34,230
That's right.

2022
03:21:34,980 --> 03:21:37,890
I made a lot of promises.

2023
03:21:39,455 --> 03:21:40,250
Did you make a lot of promises?

2024
03:21:40,251 --> 03:21:44,110
I feel like I've been
doing a lot of things lately.

2025
03:21:53,070 --> 03:21:54,430
My body is so hot.

2026
03:21:57,510 --> 03:21:59,270
It's okay.
I don't have to put on a blanket.

2027
03:22:00,320 --> 03:22:01,560
Then I'll just put on my waist.

2028
03:22:03,100 --> 03:22:04,100
I'll get a cold.

2029
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:10,040
Girls shouldn't get a cold.

2030
03:22:10,041 --> 03:22:11,241
You can't let go of your hand.

2031
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:33,840
Do you want to try to be a
child again? I don't know.

2032
03:22:35,560 --> 03:22:36,880


2033
03:22:38,440 --> 03:22:39,500
Are you okay now?

2034
03:22:39,740 --> 03:22:40,740
I think I'm okay.

2035
03:22:50,110 --> 03:22:51,730
I didn't expect you to
be so excited at this age.

2036
03:22:51,731 --> 03:22:53,291
I didn't think it would be so much fun.

2037
03:22:53,470 --> 03:22:54,470
That's right.

2038
03:22:54,590 --> 03:22:56,110
After all, it's thanks to the lecture.

2039
03:22:57,370 --> 03:22:58,370
It's amazing.

2040
03:22:59,230 --> 03:23:00,990
The lecture is amazing.

2041
03:23:04,380 --> 03:23:10,580
I think there are still many more lectures.

2042
03:23:12,840 --> 03:23:14,840
Let's develop more.

2043
03:23:16,900 --> 03:23:18,040
That's right.

2044
03:23:18,400 --> 03:23:19,700
It's fun.
