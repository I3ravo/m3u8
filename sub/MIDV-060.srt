1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the end of the story.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you for watching.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, right.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I forgot to take off the gloves.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go to the bathroom.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The bathroom is nice, isn't it?

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who's that girl?

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She's my relative, Nana.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My parents went on a trip, and I'm taking care of her.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Nana, this is Mumi.

14
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Goro lives in the neighborhood.

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nice to meet you.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Nana is born and raised in the city.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It seems that the countryside is not as exciting as it seems.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Goro-chan, I told you not to play around.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No matter what you say, there's nothing to do these days.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
All you can do is to take a bath.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm glad. I don't like taking a bath.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was stabbed here earlier.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, my, oh, my, it's a big deal.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then I have to put on some medicine.

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've been working hard since I was little.

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm a little tired.

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can't go.

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's impossible.

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
From here to Tokyo.

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It takes a whole day by bus and train.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why do you say that?

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If you want to see me, you can come to me.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I just want to see you.

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I know you met other girls.

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you going to do?

36
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,060
Come on.

37
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,420
I'm going to leave.

38
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,460
Is something wrong?

39
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,460
You're not feeling well, are you?

40
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,460
No, I'm not.

41
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
You're not?

42
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Even if you get dizzy,

43
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,460
you'll be fine.

44
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Right?

45
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
Yes.

46
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,460
They say humans are the best.

47
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,460
What are you talking about?

48
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,460
There are good things and bad things after good things.

49
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,460
There are good things after bad things.

50
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:14,460
You may have a new voice when you fall in love.

51
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,460
If I had a boyfriend, I wouldn't be able to do what I couldn't do.

52
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:28,460
Even though I lost my grandfather, I was very lonely,

53
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
but I was supported by my neighbors,

54
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,460
and I could understand people's feelings better than before.

55
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Yes, and I found a good man.

56
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
What? You have a boyfriend?

57
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,460
You must be bored living in the countryside.

58
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,460
But you can only do it here.

59
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,460
Maybe something good will happen.

60
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:18,180
OKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOK10

61
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,180
Hello!

62
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,180
What about you, Chiyoko?

63
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,180
I'm on a date.

64
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
A date?

65
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
I see.

66
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,180
It's nice to be able to fall in love no matter how old you are.

67
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm jealous.

68
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
Can you lend me your hand?

69
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,180
You don't have a good boyfriend, do you?

70
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
I used to.

71
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,180
Well, I had a good boyfriend.

72
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,180
While I was busy, I was taken to other places.

73
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Since then, I've been all alone.

74
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Well, sometimes when I come to see my mother-in-law,

75
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,680
we talk to each other,

76
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,680
You know, I feel like I'm talking to you more than you are talking to me.

77
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm so sleepy.

78
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm so sleepy.

79
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
It's hot.

80
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
What is it?

81
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
What? No, no, no, no.

82
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Nothing. Nothing.

83
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Oh, right.

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
I didn't see you for a long time.

85
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Well, I guess I'll have to go.

86
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Well, I guess I'll have to go.

87
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
I'll be going.

88
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Take care of your grandma.

89
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Wait.

90
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Uncle, sit here.

91
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Okay.

92
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Uncle, would you like to have a little chat with me?

93
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
A little chat?

94
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Sure, but what are you going to do?

95
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm so bored that I feel like I'm going to die.

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,280
Will you do anything for me?

97
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,320
Sure, anything is fine, but if it's something I can do for you...

98
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,320
Then...

99
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,620
Sex?

100
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,760
Sex? No, no, no.

101
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,600
Don't make fun of me.

102
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm not making fun of you.

103
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,840
I just wanted to be with someone like you.

104
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
There are a lot of people in the industry.

105
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes, there are.

106
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,840
A rich old man comes to me asking me if I want to be a father.

107
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
But I can't do that.

108
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,840
I want to have sex with someone like an old man.

109
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
What?

110
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
No?

111
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I don't think it's a good idea.

112
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Then it's okay?

113
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Well, I guess so.

114
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Wait a minute.

115
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I have to take a bath.

117
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
What is this?

118
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
What is this?

119
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,840
I get excited when I sweat.

120
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
You sweat like this?

121
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
No.

122
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
My sweat is the same as yours.

123
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,840
You don't like my sweat?

124
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
No.

125
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I don't mind if you sweat.

126
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
But my feet are so dirty.

127
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
It's salty.

128
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm going to put it on your face.

129
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Your feet...

130
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
I can smell it.

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
It doesn't hurt at all.

132
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I can't see your face properly.

133
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
What's wrong?

134
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm a little embarrassed.

135
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
My feet are wet.

136
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
My feet are wet.

137
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
My feet are wet.

138
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
My feet are wet.

139
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
What's wrong?

140
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
What do you want me to do?

141
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I've never done anything like this before.

142
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,840
You said you'd go out with me if you had time.

143
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm going to put it on you.

144
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Do you like nails too?

145
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Your nails are amazing.

146
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Amazing what?

147
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,840
You're good at it.

148
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
You're sweating a lot.

149
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm going to take it off.

150
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
You're worried about the sweat, aren't you?

151
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes, I am.

152
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
You want to take it off, don't you?

153
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,840
That's what you do when you're in a good mood.

154
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Oh, I'm a little embarrassed.

155
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Oh, I have a lot of sweat here.

156
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Why?

157
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
It's so cold.

158
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
What's going on here?

159
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,840
It's a little different from usual.

160
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
What's that?

161
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
You are weird

162
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Wait

163
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Don't touch me

164
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
No, no, no

165
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I wanted to have sex with you

166
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Thank you

167
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
I haven't done it yet

168
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Do you want to do it?

169
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
What? You don't want to do it?

170
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
No, I don't think so.

171
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,840
No, I don't think it's a good idea to do this.

172
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Are you sure you don't want to do it?

173
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Just a little bit.

174
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
You said you don't want to do it.

175
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
I think I'll stop.

176
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Do you want to do it?

177
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Do you want to do it?

178
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Do you want to pee?

179
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Do you want to pee?

180
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Come here.

182
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,840
You don't need it, do you?

183
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Wait a minute.

184
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Let me touch you.

185
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
I like you a lot, don't I?

186
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
I like you a lot, don't I?

187
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
It's boring, isn't it?

188
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
You're in the way, aren't you?

189
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Yeah.

190
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Oh, it's gone.

191
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Oh, it's a little out.

192
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Cute.

193
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
I can see it.

194
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Oh, no, no, no, no.

195
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Why?

196
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Oh, no, no, no, no.

197
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
Cute.

198
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
You're so cute.

199
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Let me touch you.

200
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Look at his face.

201
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
You're amazing.

202
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
It's hot.

203
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
It's hot.

204
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Can I touch you?

205
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
It's okay.

206
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
It's a beautiful cup.

207
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
What kind of cup do you like?

208
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I like this shape. This is nice.

209
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Let me see.

210
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Give me a hug.

211
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
You're so beautiful.

212
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
I want to see you more.

213
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
You're so beautiful.

214
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Am I beautiful?

215
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
You have a cute face.

216
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
You have a cute body.

217
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I'm happy.

218
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
You're going to give me a lot of compliments, aren't you?

219
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Yeah.

220
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh, it's cold.

221
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
It's cold.

222
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Oh, it's cold.

223
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
I don't want to run away.

224
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm scared.

225
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Hey, Uncle.

226
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Don't be so impatient.

227
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
I'm not going to run away.

228
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
It's been a long time.

229
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm bored.

230
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
That's right.

231
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
It's getting full.

232
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It's getting like this.

233
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,840
How many times did you throw it away?

234
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
You are a good boy, aren't you?

235
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Well, I haven't seen you for a long time.

236
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,840
It's been a long time?

237
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Oh, look at me.

238
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh, I said hello.

239
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Take a deep breath.

240
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Yeah.

241
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
What's wrong?

242
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
What's wrong?

243
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Get on my side.

244
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
It's getting hot.

245
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
You can't sleep on your own.

246
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
I'll hold it in.

247
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
It's not nice to sleep together.

248
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
You're so cute.

249
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
What are you looking at?

250
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
You're so cute.

251
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Look at me.

252
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I was too close.

254
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
It's okay.

255
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Hey, wait a minute.

256
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
It's okay.

257
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Don't touch me.

258
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
It's okay.

259
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
No, no, no.

260
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Come here.

261
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

262
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
You want to put it in?

263
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
But...

264
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,840
I can't tell you to put it in.

265
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Why not?

266
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Wait a minute.

268
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Something is coming out.

269
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
No, no, no.

270
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
It's dirty.

271
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
It's dirty.

272
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
You're so dirty.

273
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm sweating.

274
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I'm sweating.

275
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Are you sweating?

276
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Can I lick it?

277
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, it's in your mouth.

278
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Oh, your tongue.

279
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
It's all wet because of the old man.

280
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
You're lucky today.

281
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I was lucky.

282
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
The old man came, didn't he?

283
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm going on a date with my grandma.

284
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
What should I do?

285
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I was so hungry that I couldn't eat anything.

286
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I'm so full.

287
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
I'm so full.

288
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm so full.

289
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm so full.

290
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
I'm so full.

291
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Wow, you're doing a great job.

292
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,840
It's very soft.

293
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,840
It feels so good.

294
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
It feels good, doesn't it?

295
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
It feels good, doesn't it?

296
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
It's the first time I see you like this.

297
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
It's the first time I've ever seen you like this.

298
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Is it?

299
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
It feels good, doesn't it?

300
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
It feels good.

301
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
It's coming out of my throat.

302
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,340
I can't stop it.

303
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
It's amazing.

304
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
It's scary.

305
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,340
It feels good.

306
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,840
Don't go.

307
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,340
It feels good, so hold on.

308
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
It's coming out.

309
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
No, no.

310
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
Look at that!

311
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
You're amazing, aren't you?

312
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
You're amazing.

313
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
I'm all wet.

314
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Number one.

315
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
Number one.

316
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,340
What are you going to do?

317
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
What do you mean?

318
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Are you still sleepy?

319
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
Are you okay?

320
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
What?

321
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
I'm fine with it.

322
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
What about you?

323
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,340
I'm fine with it too.

324
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I'll do it more.

325
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
It's just a waste of time.

326
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
It's a secret from your grandmother.

327
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
What are you doing?

328
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
It's in.

329
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
It's in.

330
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
It's in.

331
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
It's in.

332
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
It's in.

333
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
It's in.

334
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Uncle,

335
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,340
how do you feel inside my blanket?

336
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
It feels great.

337
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
It feels great?

338
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
It feels great.

339
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,340
It feels great.

340
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
It feels great.

341
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
How do you feel?

342
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,340
How do you feel?

343
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
How do you feel?

344
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
I feel like I'm going to die.

345
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
You're so chubby.

346
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
Yes.

347
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
It's getting bigger.

348
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
It's about to tear.

349
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
It's so tight.

350
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,340
Does it hurt?

351
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Does it feel good?

352
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Yes.

353
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Does it feel good?

354
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
Yes, it feels good.

355
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Wow, this is amazing.

356
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,340
It's so cool in here.

357
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
It's amazing.

358
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
Look at me.

359
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,340
It feels good.

360
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
No, no.

361
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
What?

362
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
No, no.

363
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
You can't feel better by yourself.

364
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,340
It really hurts.

365
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Feels good.

366
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
I feel good inside.

367
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
It's white.

368
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Your waist.

369
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
Your waist.

370
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Are you okay?

371
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
I feel good.

372
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
I feel good.

373
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
I'll do it again.

374
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
Why?

375
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
You want me to do it again?

376
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,340
I can't do it anymore.

377
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
It's a little intense.

378
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
It feels good.

379
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
It's so hot.

380
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,340
It's hot.

381
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,340
I'm so tired.

382
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
I'm so tired.

383
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,340
I'm so tired.

384
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Are you okay?

385
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
I'm so tired.

386
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,340
How do you feel?

387
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
I'm fine.

388
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,340
Oh, it's cold.

389
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,340
You're not moving at all, are you?

390
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,340
Yes, I am.

391
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Wow.

392
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
Oh, it's cold.

393
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Oh, it's cold.

394
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,760
More more!

395
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,940
This!

396
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,240
Oh, feels good!

397
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,200
Fuck it.

398
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,100
You can do it more.

399
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
I can see your back.

400
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Yeah, I can see it.

401
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
I was looking somewhere.

402
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm sorry.

403
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
I'm sorry.

404
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
I'm sorry.

406
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
I'm sorry.

407
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm sorry.

408
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I'm sorry.

411
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I'm sorry.

412
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh, there you are.

414
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Did you see?

415
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Yes, I did.

416
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Your butt is so beautiful.

417
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Can you see it?

418
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Really?

420
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Yes.

421
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Can you see me?

422
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Yes, I can see you.

423
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
I feel so good.

424
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm so tired.

425
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
I'm so tired.

426
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Great.

427
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Amazing.

428
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Oh, my God.

429
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
It's so tight.

430
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
It's so tight.

431
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,720
What should I do?

432
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Wow, it feels so good.

433
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Do you feel good?

434
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
I'll do it for you.

435
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Really?

436
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,720
If you feel good, come up to me.

437
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Okay.

438
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,720
You're so cute.

439
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
You want to be up there too, right?

440
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Oh, it hurts.

441
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
It hurts.

442
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Are you okay?

443
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
It hurts.

444
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
It hurts.

445
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
It hurts.

446
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
It hurts.

447
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
You're a pervert.

448
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
It feels good.

449
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Feels good?

450
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Close your eyes.

451
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
It's closed.

452
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Close your eyes.

453
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Close your eyes.

454
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
I'm glad you woke up.

455
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
This is amazing.

456
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
I'm so tired.

457
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
I can't sleep.

458
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
What?

459
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
I can't sleep.

460
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
I can't do it anymore.

461
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I can't do it anymore.

462
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I'm sorry.

463
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Wake up, uncle.

464
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
Hold on, Pon-chan.

465
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Pon-chan, hold on.

466
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Hold on.

467
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Thank you.

468
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
I'll go get some water.

469
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Hold on tight.

470
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Hold on tight.

471
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,720
I feel like I'm about to cry.

472
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm so happy.

473
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm so happy.

474
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,720
I'm so happy.

475
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm so happy.

476
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,720
I'm so happy.

477
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,720
I'm so happy.

478
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Ah, my legs hurt.

479
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
What happened?

480
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
What's wrong?

481
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
It hurts.

482
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Huh?

483
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Where is it?

484
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Where is your favorite spot?

485
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
Right here

486
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Okay

487
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I don't care where it is

488
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Ah

489
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
Huh?

490
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Huh?

491
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Huh?

492
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Huh?

493
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Ah

494
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm sorry

495
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I'm sorry

496
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I'm sorry

497
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm sorry

498
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Ah

499
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Ah

500
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
Ah

501
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
Oh, my God.

502
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
Oh, my God.

503
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Oh, my God.

504
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
What should I do?

505
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
What should I do?

506
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Oh, it's cold.

507
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Let me lick you.

508
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
What is it?

509
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
You're moving too much.

510
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm sorry.

511
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,720
You're crying too much.

512
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,920
Let's sit here.

513
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,920
Okay.

514
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,920
Wow.

515
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,420
Thank you.

516
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
That's a lot.

517
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,520
Yeah.

518
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:59,220
Everyone in this village is so kind.

519
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,420
Yeah.

520
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,520
It's a small village, so we have to support each other.

521
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,920
If someone's in trouble, we'll help.

522
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,020
That's what this village is like.

523
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,520
Hmm.

524
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:20,520
If there's someone in trouble, I have to help you.

525
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Oh, that's a good idea.

526
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
I'm sorry.

527
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
What?

528
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Nothing.

529
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,520
You're in trouble, aren't you?

530
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,520
What?

531
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Because you were looking at me because you didn't like me.

532
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,520
You wanted to touch my boobs.

533
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Don't you want to be licked like this?

534
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Don't you think so?

535
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,520
I'll help you.

536
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Let's go.

537
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Please lie down.

538
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
Come on.

539
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,520
I'll help you.

540
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,520
I'm talking about Tsugi-san.

541
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
No?

542
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,520
Hey, lick it properly.

543
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
It feels good.

545
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,520
How do you feel?

546
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Good.

547
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
How is it?

548
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Is it good?

549
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
Yes

550
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Is it good?

551
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Yes

552
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,520
How is it?

553
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Yes

554
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,520
Yes

555
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Yes

556
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
Yes

557
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
Yes

558
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Yes

559
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Yes

560
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Yes

561
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,520
I'm sorry.

562
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,520
I feel so bad.

563
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
Do you feel bad?

564
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
Do you feel bad?

565
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,520
Like the people in the village?

566
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
That's right.

567
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
I'll be in trouble.

568
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,520
Won't you be in trouble if you do that?

569
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,520
I'll be in trouble if I don't do it.

570
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,520
You don't mind if I do it?

571
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,520
No, but...

572
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
Won't you wake me up?

573
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
No, I won't.

574
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
Thank you.

575
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
I'm sorry.

576
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
I did my best.

577
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
I'm sorry.

578
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,520
I'm sorry.

579
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,520
I'm so tired.

580
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
I'm so tired.

581
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
It's so cold.

582
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,520
It's so cold.

583
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Are you okay?

584
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
You're all sweaty.

585
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,520
I'm in trouble.

586
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,520
You're sweating a lot.

587
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
I'm in trouble.

588
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,520
Are you in trouble?

589
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm trying to help you.

590
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,520
Why are you running away?

591
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Can I have a sip?

592
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,520
I'll always help you when you're in trouble.

593
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
What?

594
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
It's like today.

595
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,520
How is it?

596
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
I want you to help me.

597
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,420
What happened to her.

598
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,420
I'm sorry.

599
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,420
You're wearing a very embarrassing costume.

600
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,420
Why are you still here?

601
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,420
Can I talk to you?

602
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,420
No.

603
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,420
Can I make a sound?

604
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,420
No.

605
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,420
It tickles.

606
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,980
You brought delicious vegetables for me, didn't you?

607
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,980
Yes.

608
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,980
Do you feel good now?

609
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,980
Yes, but I'm a little confused.

610
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,980
Look at me more.

611
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,980
You're not touching it yet, but it's getting harder over there.

612
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,980
Why is it getting harder over there?

613
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,980
It's because I'm holding it here.

614
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,980
I'm holding it here.

615
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Can you open it for me?

616
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,980
Oh, like this?

617
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,980
There you go.

618
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,980
Wait a minute.

619
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,980
I want to go to bed.

620
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,980
No, but...

621
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,980
No?

622
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,980
No, you can't do that.

623
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:02,980
You're dressed like this, but you can't show it to me.

624
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,980
I can't show it to you.

625
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,980
You're weird.

626
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,980
You're definitely weird.

627
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,980
You didn't say you wanted help, did you?

628
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,980
I did.

629
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,980
I told you so.

630
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,980
Wait, don't do that.

631
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,980
Why are you hiding it?

632
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,980
Because...

633
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
It's not a joke.

634
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,980
Oh, it's warm.

635
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,980
Oh, it's warm.

636
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,980
No, no, no.

637
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,980
No?

638
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,980
I don't think so.

639
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,980
Do you want me to pet you?

640
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,980
No, I don't.

641
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,980
How do you like to be touched?

642
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,980
Do you like to be touched?

643
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,980
I'm sorry.

644
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,980
I'm sorry.

645
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,980
I'm sorry.

646
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,980
I'm sorry.

647
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,980
I want to help you.

648
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,980
Tell me how you feel.

649
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,980
Let me see your face.

650
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
You look like you've seen a doll.

651
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,980
Do you want to see it?

652
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Let me show you.

653
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,740
Can you see it?

654
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,740
Yes, I can see it.

655
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:36,740
What do you think of my boobs and your boobs?

656
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,740
Can you see them?

657
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,740
Alright,

658
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Look...

659
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,320
Wow...

660
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,160
Well, your uncle is rubbing your chin a lot.

661
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,060
Does it feel good?

662
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Really?

663
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,060
Uncle, you're holding it in, right?

664
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,400
Yeah.

665
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
You're making a lot of sounds.

666
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Wow!

667
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Amazing!

668
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Amazing!

669
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Yes, it feels like I'm being touched by the acupuncture point, too.

670
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
This?

671
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
You like this kind of thing?

672
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Like this?

673
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Tell me more about what you like.

674
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,400
No, no. I'll do my best.

675
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
This one?

676
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Yes.

677
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Wow, I like this strong one.

678
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Oh, it's a Saki-podame.

679
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
No way.

680
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
You're a pervert, too.

681
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Oh, that's a Saki-podame.

682
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
It's getting harder and harder.

683
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
I'm gonna lick you.

684
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
No, I'm not gonna lick you.

685
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,400
What?

686
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
What's going on?

687
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
I told you not to lick me.

688
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
I'm so tired.

689
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
I'm so tired.

690
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Then, I'm not gonna lick you.

691
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,400
No, but...

692
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
I'm so tired.

693
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
Then, I'm not gonna lick you.

694
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
No, but...

695
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
What are you going to do?

696
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
Oh, I'm counting on you.

697
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Thank you.

698
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,120
No, it's here.

699
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,440
Wow.

700
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,440
You look so cool, old man.

701
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,440
How do you feel?

702
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,440
I almost fell asleep.

703
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,440
Wow, it's getting harder again.

704
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,440
Your blood pressure is getting really hard.

705
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,440
Yes, it feels good.

706
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,440
Show me how you feel.

707
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,440
It feels good.

708
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,420
Make more sounds.

709
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,420
Squish it.

710
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:27,460
A

711
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,420
May I?

712
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,420
Let's go.

713
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,420
Are you okay?

714
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,420
I'm glad it's not raining.

715
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,420
But...

716
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,420
No, no.

717
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,420
Are you going?

718
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,420
I'm so tired.

719
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,420
You can't do it anymore.

720
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,420
You're so fat.

721
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,420
I'm fine.

722
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,420
You can't do it anymore.

723
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,420
But you're coming out a lot.

724
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,420
I'm so tired.

725
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,420
Me too.

726
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:54,420
It's been a long time since I had a massage.

727
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,420
I'm tired again.

728
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,420
Did you bring it?

729
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,420
You're fast.

730
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,420
You have a grumpy face.

731
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,420
Can you show me more?

732
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,420
More, more.

733
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,420
It feels good.

734
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,420
Oh, sorry.

735
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:56,420
Ah, sorry.

736
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,420
You came out at once.

737
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,420
Did you feel good?

738
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,420
It's still hard.

739
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:23,420
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea to have a cat that's not afraid of anything.

740
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:33,420
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea to have a cat that's not afraid of anything.

741
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,420
I'm going to take a bath.

742
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,420
I'm so happy.

743
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,420
Why are you here?

744
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,420
I'm here.

745
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,420
I'm not here tomorrow.

746
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,420
It's hot.

747
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,420
It's hot.

748
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:04,420
Well then, I guess I should get going.

749
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:09,420
It's fine. Take your time.

750
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,420
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

751
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,420
Are you okay?

752
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,420
Thank you.

753
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:24,420
Don't be so self-righteous.

754
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,420
Rest until you're fully recovered.

755
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,420
Well then, I'll do as you say.

756
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:04,420
I'm sorry.

757
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,420
I drank too much.

758
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,420
It's okay.

759
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,420
Chiyo has a relative of yours and Benpin.

760
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,420
Are you from Tokyo?

761
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,420
Uncle, you smell like alcohol.

762
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,420
I'm sorry.

763
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,420
What?

764
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:39,420
You were looking at me like you didn't like me, weren't you?

765
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,420
No, I wasn't.

766
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,420
Really?

767
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,420
What are you doing?

768
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,420
Huh?

769
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,420
Can you hear me?

770
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,420
Huh?

771
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:07,420
Have you ever done something like this to me?

772
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,420
No.

773
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,420
I've never done anything like that.

774
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,420
Huh?

775
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:23,420
It's been a long time since I've been drinking, and you've been standing up.

776
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,420
Don't tease me.

777
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,420
I'm not teasing you.

778
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,420
How are you?

779
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,420
I'm scared.

780
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,420
Don't make a sound.

781
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,420
What did you say?

782
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,420
What did you do?

783
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,420
What are you looking at?

784
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,420
You wanted to kiss me, right?

785
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,420
I'm sorry.

786
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,420
Well, that's...

787
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,420
Can I do it?

788
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,420
What?

789
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,420
Don't you want to do it?

790
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:00,420
No, I don't.

791
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,420
Okay, okay, okay.

792
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,420
Ouch!

793
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,920
That's...

794
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,920
Be clear, old man.

795
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,920
You're an adult, aren't you?

796
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,920
I want to believe.

797
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,420
Do you want to start from the old man?

798
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,420
What do you want me to do?

799
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,420
It's okay.

800
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,420
Let's start from the top.

801
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,420
I'm scared.

802
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,420
You're so cute.

803
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:19,420
Wow, you are so weak.

804
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:37,420
You were looking at me with a grumpy look.

805
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:42,180
My hands It's like this

806
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,420
It's hot.

807
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:13,420
It's hot.

808
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,420
Ah...

809
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,420
Ah...

810
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,420
Ah...

811
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,420
What do you want me to do?

812
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,420
What?

813
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,420
Are you okay?

814
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,420
What do you want to lick?

815
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,420
Lick me.

816
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,420
Where?

817
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,420
Here.

818
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,420
Here?

819
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,420
Ah...

820
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:07,420
If you make that sound, grandma will come.

821
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,420
Are you okay?

822
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,420

823
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,420

824
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,420

01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,420

Please touch me.

828
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,420
Can you do me a favor?

829
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,420
It hurts a lot.

830
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:47,420
You look like you're in a good mood, Mr.Sukouji.

831
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,420
This is in the way.

832
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,420
It's okay, isn't it?

833
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,720
It's okay, isn't it, old man?

834
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,720
What's wrong?

835
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,720
It's not good.

836
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,720
It's not good.

837
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,760
The old man told you to lick it, didn't he?

838
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,760
No, that's right, but...

839
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,760
Which one?

840
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,880

841
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,880

01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,880
You look like a pervert.

844
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,880
Please be quiet.

845
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,880
Your grandmother will hear you.

846
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,720
They may already hear you.

847
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,880
Is it good?

848
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,880
Does it feel good?

849
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,880
Oh, you feel good, don't you?

850
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,880
You're so cute.

851
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,880
You don't do it often, do you?

852
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,880
What are you talking about?

853
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,880
Are you doing it?

854
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
I'm not doing it.

855
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,880
Then, how about a girl's boobs?

856
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,880
You haven't touched it yet?

857
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,880
How is it?

858
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,880
I can't hold it.

859
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,880
It's so soft.

860
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
Uncle, try harder.

861
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,880
What are you doing?

862
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,880
What do you want to do?

863
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,800
I can't do it like this.

864
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,840
You are the one who needs to do it.

865
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,840
No, no, no.

866
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,840
No.

867
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,840
You might be watched by someone.

868
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,840
What should I do?

869
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,840
You're a pervert, aren't you, old man?

870
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,840
You want to do something dirty again?

871
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,840
You want to do something dirty again?

872
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,840
I see.

873
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,840
You like the last one, don't you?

874
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,840
You can't sleep on your own.

875
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,840
No, I can't.

876
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,840
You can't sleep on your own, can you?

877
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,840
I can't.

878
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,840
He is sleeping.

879
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,840
He is sleeping.

880
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,840
Don't do that.

881
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,840
He is sleeping.

882
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
Don't do that.

883
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,840
Let me out.

884
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,840
He is not feeling good yet.

885
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,840
What is it?

886
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,840
What do you want to do?

887
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,840
I want to feel the feeling.

888
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,840
What should I do?

889
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,840
I want to do this.

890
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,840
What?

891
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,840
What?

892
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,840
What?

893
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,840
What?

894
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,840
What?

895
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,840
I want to do this.

896
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,840
What?

897
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,840
You are so positive, aren't you?

898
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,840
It's amazing, isn't it?

899
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,840
It's hard, isn't it?

900
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,840
I'm sorry.

901
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,840
You are always going to go.

902
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,840
I want to eat.

903
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
I want to eat.

904
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,840
I want to eat.

905
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,840
You look so sad.

906
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,840
Why do you look like that?

907
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
I want to go out.

908
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
No, you can't.

909
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,840
You'll get a fever if you stay here.

910
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,840
What?

911
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,840
It's an old man.

912
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,840
What are you doing?

913
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,840
What?

914
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,840
What are you doing?

915
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,840
What are you doing?

916
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,840
I'm closing the door.

917
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,840
Here?

918
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,840
Ah!

919
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,840
It's cold, isn't it?

920
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,840
It's cold, isn't it?

921
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:13,740
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

922
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:15,740
Oh, it's warm.

923
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,740
I'm coming.

924
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,740
It feels good.

925
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,740
It's warm.

926
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,740
It's warm and it feels good.

927
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,740
Don't go without permission.

928
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:52,740
Have you ever seen an old man moving?

929
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:55,740
No, I haven't.

930
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

931
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,740
I'm scared.

932
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:06,740
Don't do what I did.

933
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,740
I'm scared.

934
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:13,740
Uncle, look at me.

935
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,740
Feels good.

936
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:31,740
Uncle, you look like that.

937
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,740
No, no, no.

938
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,740
Don't do that.

939
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:57,740
No.

940
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,740
Don't do that.

941
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,740
Don't do that.

942
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,740
Don't do that.

943
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:15,740
I'm sorry.

944
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,740
I'm sorry.

945
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,740
Your face is so cute.

946
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:30,740
I'm sorry.

947
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,740
You're so cute.

948
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:34,740
I'm sorry.

949
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:37,340
Let's go back near your arm

950
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:46,280
Do not give up

951
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,800
It's okay

952
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,180
Disappearing

953
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:04,180
What should I do?

954
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,180
Ah...

955
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,140
What should I do?

956
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,980
Ah...

957
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,680
Ah...

958
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:13,180
Ah...

959
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,180
Ah...

960
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,180
Ah...

961
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,680
Ah...

962
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,180
Ah...

963
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,180
Ah...

964
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,680
Ah...

965
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,680
Ah...

966
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,680
It's moving a lot.

967
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,680
Let's go to the second floor.

968
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,680
From the back.

969
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,680
From the back?

970
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,680
Yes, from the back.

971
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,680
I like the second and third floors.

972
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,680
Here?

973
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,680
Here?

974
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,680
Here?

975
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,680
What are you doing?

976
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,680
Haa…

977
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,680
Haa…

978
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,680
Haa…

979
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:42,680
Haa…

980
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:46,680
Haa…

981
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,680
I'm sleepy…

982
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,680
Haa…

983
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,680
I'm so cold.

984
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,680
I'm so cold.

985
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,680
I'm so cold.

986
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,680
It's okay, it's okay.

987
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,680
Oh, my God.

988
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,680
Oh, my God.

989
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,680
Oh, my God.

990
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,680
Oh, my God.

991
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,680
He's gone.

992
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:53,680
Masu...

993
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,680
Are you asleep?

994
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,680
Masu...

995
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,680
I can see over there.

996
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,680
It's so hot.

997
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,680
Let's go in.

998
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:40,680
Open your mouth.

999
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,680
It's sweet.

1000
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,680
I'm sorry.

1001
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,680
I'm sorry.

1002
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,680
Wow, amazing!

1003
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,680
My back is moving.

1004
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,680
I'm sorry.

1005
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,680
I'm sorry.

1006
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,680
It's so painful.

1007
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,680
It hurts.

1008
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,680
It's so painful.

1009
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,680
It's painful.

1010
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,680
It's painful.

1011
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,680
It's so painful.

1012
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,680
It's so painful.

1013
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,680
The first time I saw her, I was shocked.

1014
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,680
I thought she was crying.

1015
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,680
I'm sorry.

1016
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,680
She was so cute.

1017
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,680
I want to see her like this.

1018
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:19,680
I was surprised.

1019
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,680
She was so cute.

1020
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,680
I was so shocked.

1021
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,680
I was so shocked.

1022
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,680
I was so shocked.

1023
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,680
I was so shocked.

1024
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,680
I was so shocked.

1025
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,680
I was so shocked.

1026
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,680
It's coming.

1027
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,680
Ouch!

1028
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,680
It's a good smell.

1029
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,680
It's so cool.

1030
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,680
Oh, it hurts.

1031
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,680
Amazing.

1032
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,680
Amazing.

1033
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,680
Have you ever done this before?

1034
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,680
Yes, it was my first time.

1035
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:57,680
First time?

1036
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,680
Amazing.

1037
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,680
Oh, no.

1038
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,680
Oh, no.

1039
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,680
Oh, no.

1040
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:02,680
Oh, no.

1041
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,680
Oh, no.

1042
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:04,680
Oh, no.

1043
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,680
Oh, no.

1044
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,680
Oh, no.

1045
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,680
Oh, no.

1046
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,680
Oh, no.

1047
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,680
Oh, no.

1048
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,680
Oh, no.

1049
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,680
How do you feel, Mr. Kimochi?

1050
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,680
Mr. Kimochi, Mr. Kimochi.

1051
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,680
You're amazing.

1052
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,680
Mr. Kimochi, touch my boobs.

1053
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,680
My boobs?

1054
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:04,680
Mr. Kimochi, Mr. Kimochi.

1055
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:09,460
How are you feeling?

1056
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:45,460
Well then, let's take a break.

1057
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:49,460
What? Take a break?

1058
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:51,460
I don't have a break.

1059
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:55,460
It's been like this since morning.

1060
01:48:55,460 --> 01:49:01,460
Today, I'm going to do it all day long until my grandmother comes home.

1061
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:03,460
All day long?

1062
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:04,460
Yeah.

1063
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,460
No?

1064
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:08,460
It's getting bigger.

1065
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,460
But...

1066
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,460
It's impossible.

1067
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,460
It's fun to play with you.

1068
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:18,460
I'm dying because I've been playing with you for a long time.

1069
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,460
It's a dream.

1070
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:22,460
It's a feeling.

1071
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,460
It's about time.

1072
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,460
Don't do that.

1073
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,460
Ouch!

1074
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:30,460
Ouch!

1075
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,460
It's so strange.

1076
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,460
I'm sorry.

1077
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:38,460
I've already taken care of your feelings.

1078
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,460
The phone is ringing.

1079
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,460
The phone is ringing.

1080
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,460
I'm tired.

1081
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,460
I'm tired.

1082
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:57,460
Don't you want to start over?

1083
01:49:57,460 --> 01:49:59,460
The phone is ringing.

1084
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:03,460
Well, I'll think about it when I get home.

1085
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:07,460
Oh, wait a minute.

1086
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:11,460
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1087
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:16,460
I might die again today.

1088
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:19,460
Oh, that's boring.

1089
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:27,460
I have a favor to ask you.

1090
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:28,460
I think so.

1091
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,460
You think so?

1092
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,460
Yeah.

1093
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:11,460
Nara-chan, he's a good guy, but he's a little shy and shy.

1094
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:17,460
He's interested in women, but he's inexperienced.

1095
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:25,460
So, Nara-chan, can you make him a man?

1096
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:27,460
What are you going to do?

1097
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:33,460
Well, I don't have time, so I don't mind.

1098
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:37,460
You don't mind? Thank you, thank you.

1099
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:39,460
Yuppe, I'm going.

1100
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,460
Do your best.

1101
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,460
Nara-chan, I'm counting on you.

1102
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,460
Doutei, huh?

1103
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:07,460
Doutei is so precious to an old man.

1104
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:10,460
I don't think I'll see you in Tokyo.

1105
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,460
Come here.

1106
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:19,460
You're too stiff.

1107
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:23,460
Are you scared?

1108
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:30,460
Have you ever kissed someone?

1109
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:34,460
Then what about holding hands like this?

1110
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:44,460
Then what about seeing boobs?

1111
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,460
Do you have any?

1112
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,460
If it's a video...

1113
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,460
A video?

1114
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:53,460
Look at me.

1115
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:56,460
Look at me like that.

1116
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:05,460
Can I kiss you?

1117
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:06,460
Huh?

1118
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:09,460
Yeah.

1119
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:22,460
Wow, you really are a virgin.

1120
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:33,460
It's your first kiss.

1121
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,460
I'll give you a lot.

1122
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,460
This is...

1123
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:00,460
There's a lot of hair.

1124
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,460
How do you feel?

1125
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,460
It's soft.

1126
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:15,460
And it's warm.

1127
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:19,460
It's sticky, right?

1128
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:52,460
I really wanted to see you.

1129
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:00,460
Then you won't forget me forever, right?

1130
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:02,460
You're so cute.

1131
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:25,460
Open your mouth.

1132
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,460
Open your mouth.

1133
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:37,460
Do you want more?

1134
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,460
Wow.

1135
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:56,460
It's the same as before, isn't it?

1136
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:59,460
It smells like a girl.

1137
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,460
It smells like a girl?

1138
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:03,460
You're a brother, aren't you?

1139
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:07,460
You don't know that it smells like a girl, do you?

1140
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:11,460
But it's different from a boy.

1141
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,460
That's right.

1142
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:34,460
I was asked to make you a man.

1143
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,460
Thank you.

1144
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:46,460
What's wrong?

1145
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,460
Can I sit down?

1146
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:56,460
It's okay.

1147
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:59,460
Uncle!

1148
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,180
Pant...

1149
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,820
Hey, old man!

1150
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:08,040
No more!

1151
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:13,040
You're being too harsh!

1152
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:14,580
I'm sorry.

1153
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,940
I felt bad to make a big mistake.

1154
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:22,240
I behaves like this too much in M感じtaうanp.

1155
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:25,540
That's why I...

1156
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,620
watch too much ESP.

1157
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,620
Am I wrong?

1158
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:32,620
If you keep staring at me like that, I'll get mad at you.

1159
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:34,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

1160
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:39,620
It's okay.

1161
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:41,620
I'll be the one to blame.

1162
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:46,620
You just have to feel good today.

1163
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:50,620
Yeah, I'll teach you how to do it.

1164
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,620
Let's go to sleep.

1165
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:13,620
I wonder what you like more.

1166
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:14,620
Ah!

1167
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:15,620
What?

1168
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,620
I like you too.

1169
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:25,620
Amazing.

1170
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:38,620
Amazing. I can feel it everywhere.

1171
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:42,620
You're a little sensitive, aren't you?

1172
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:57,620
Does it feel good?

1173
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:59,620
It feels good.

1174
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:06,620
I'm so happy to be able to be with an old man like you.

1175
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:32,620
Should I take off the bottom too?

1176
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:35,620
You don't need it, do you?

1177
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:45,620
Don't laugh.

1178
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:48,620
Oh, no.

1179
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:59,620
Is this your first time seeing this?

1180
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:04,620
It's a little embarrassing.

1181
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,620
Show me.

1182
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,700
What?

1183
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,940
Wait, wait.

1184
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:16,460
Here.

1185
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:21,020
I'll do it here.

1186
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:25,940
Sorry it's too small.

1187
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,000
You don't like the size of it?

1188
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:31,220
No.

1189
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:35,000
As if you can handle it?

1190
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I didn't have anyone to fight with until now.

1191
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I have someone to fight with.

1192
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
What about me?

1193
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
If you don't move, I'll go home.

1194
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I'm sorry, I understand.

1195
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
It's so big.

1196
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
It's warm.

1197
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,780
It was kind of scary.

1198
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:13,880
Breeze

1199
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:28,580
Tucker, you're cute!

1200
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:33,620
He fell asleep.

1201
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:34,920
Oh, my God.

1202
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:41,220
It feels so good.

1203
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:47,220
You're going to go to bed soon, aren't you?

1204
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,420
That's not good.

1205
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:53,720
Can I take it off, too?

1206
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:57,720
Wait for me.

1207
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,720
Let's have a drink.

1208
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,720
How do you feel?

1209
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:23,720
Do you want to drink with me?

1210
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:28,720
Can I sleep with you?

1211
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,720
Do you want to wake up with me?

1212
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,720
Then, can you drink with me?

1213
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,720
Wow!

1214
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,720
Can I drink with you?

1215
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:49,720
Did you see it for the first time?

1216
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:52,720
What are you doing?

1217
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:55,720
You can drink as much as you want.

1218
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:24,720
I'm sorry.

1219
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:33,720
No, you're about to die.

1220
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:35,720
But I...

1221
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:37,720
Don't do it on your own.

1222
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:39,720
I'm sorry, but...

1223
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:43,720
You're so sweet.

1224
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:50,720
I think this is the biggest one I've seen recently.

1225
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,540
I don't want it.

1226
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:13,000
That was dangerous.

1227
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,300
You turned really scary.

1228
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,620
Hey, act what I do.

1229
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:20,620
Don't lick my nipples.

1230
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,620
Don't lick my nipples.

1231
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:29,620
I'm sorry.

1232
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:45,620
I'm sorry.

1233
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:49,620
You're so good at licking your feet, Masai-kun.

1234
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:05,620
It feels so good.

1235
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:10,620
You're sweating too much.

1236
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,620
I love you too much.

1237
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:27,620
What's wrong?

1238
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:35,620
What are you thinking about?

1239
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:38,620
Just think of something that makes you feel good.

1240
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:55,620
Touch your belly.

1241
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:00,620
Like this.

1242
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:02,620
Touch your belly.

1243
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:05,620
It's your first time, isn't it?

1244
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:07,620
Look at me.

1245
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:09,620
Touch me a lot.

1246
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,620
Touch my wrist.

1247
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:15,620
Gently?

1248
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:17,620
Yes, gently.

1249
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:19,620
Like this?

1250
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:21,620
It feels good.

1251
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:24,620
It feels good.

1252
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:29,620
Touch me a lot.

1253
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:32,620
I'm so tired.

1254
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:39,620
I'm so tired.

1255
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:41,720
Good.

1256
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:57,480
Miss Shiou!

1257
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:32,480
I feel so good.

1258
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:36,480
I'm rubbing your butt in my belly.

1259
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:40,480
Amazing.

1260
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,480
You look like a man.

1261
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:51,480
Thank you.

1262
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:55,480
I haven't put it in yet.

1263
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:57,480
Are you okay?

1264
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:59,480
I don't want to.

1265
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:01,480
I want to fall.

1266
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:05,480
I want to feel good too.

1267
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:12,480
Touch me a lot.

1268
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,480
I feel so good.

1269
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:23,480
I feel so good.

1270
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,480
You're tired, aren't you?

1271
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:40,480
I'm tired.

1272
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,220
No...

1273
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:43,820
Can't you do it again?

1274
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:07,060
Wow

1275
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,560
Thank you.

1276
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:15,060
Thank you.

1277
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,560
Are you crying?

1278
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,060
I just wanna talk to you.

1279
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,060
Wow.

1280
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:28,060
Ahhhh...!

1281
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,060
No.

1282
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:36,060
No, no, don't.

1283
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:38,060
No, no.

1284
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:40,060
You're so cute.

1285
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:43,060
You're so cute.

1286
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:46,060
You're so cute.

1287
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,060
You're so cute.

1288
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:57,060
You're smiling like you're happy.

1289
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:02,060
You're so cute.

1290
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:07,060
You're thinking about Tetsu every day, aren't you?

1291
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:11,060
I'm sorry.

1292
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:14,060
I'm sorry.

1293
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:19,060
You're happy for the first time, aren't you?

1294
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:21,060
I can't.

1295
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:23,060
I can't do it.

1296
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:25,060
I can't do it.

1297
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:26,060
You don't like it?

1298
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:27,060
No.

1299
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:29,060
You don't like it?

1300
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:31,060
I don't like it.

1301
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:34,060
I'm so tired.

1302
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:46,060
Let's take a deep breath.

1303
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,060
Ah...

1304
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,060
Ah...

1305
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:51,060
Ah...

1306
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:54,060
Ah...

1307
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:55,060
Do you want to sleep?

1308
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:56,060
No...

1309
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:57,060
No...

1310
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:59,060
No...

1311
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:02,060
Ah...

1312
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:06,060
Ah...

1313
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:12,060
Should I put some water in?

1314
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:14,060
What?

1315
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:16,060
This is the first time.

1316
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:26,060
You don't have to look anymore.

1317
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:29,060
Amazing.

1318
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:31,060
I think I can go in.

1319
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:36,060
I wonder if he'll come back.

1320
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:48,060
How did you get in there?

1321
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:56,060
Look, he's in here.

1322
02:11:56,060 --> 02:12:00,060
How do you feel?

1323
02:12:00,060 --> 02:12:03,060
It's so hot.

1324
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:07,060
How do you feel?

1325
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:11,060
It's so warm.

1326
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:16,060
How do you feel?

1327
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:21,060
It's so warm.

1328
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:22,860
Oh, Imao-chan.

1329
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:26,860
Oh, Imao-chan.

1330
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:30,160
Oh, Imao-chan.

1331
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,360
Naga-chan, don't go too far.

1332
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:39,460
I'm sorry, Imao-chan.

1333
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:42,160
Naga-chan.

1334
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:47,260
Naga-chan.

1335
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:48,660
Naga-chan.

1336
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:49,940
Ren, wait.

1337
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:01,500
I can't.

1338
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:03,120
More!

1339
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:07,740
I fell.

1340
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,160
More.

1341
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:11,160
It feels so good.

1342
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,160
It feels so good.

1343
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:31,160
This is...

1344
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:33,160
I can't touch it.

1345
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:35,160
This is...

1346
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,160
Oh, it's so good.

1347
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,160
It feels so good.

1348
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:41,160
Let's do it one more time.

1349
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,160
Ah!

1350
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:46,160
Ah!

1351
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,160
Hmmm!

1352
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,160
Oh!

1353
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,160
Oh!

1354
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,160
Oh!

1355
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,160
Oh!

1356
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,160
Oh!

1357
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:02,160
Oh!

1358
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:04,160
Oh!

1359
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,160
Oh!

1360
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:37,560
Oh, it's cold.

1361
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:39,460
It's so cold.

1362
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:42,560
Oh, it's so cold.

1363
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,860
It's so cold.

1364
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:51,660
It's so cold.

1365
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:54,360
It's so cold.

1366
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,960
Oh, it's cold.

1367
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:05,060
Are you okay?

1368
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:07,060
How do you feel?

1369
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:09,060
How do you feel?

1370
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:40,500
Mom.

1371
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:43,600
What?

1372
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:57,940
Mom's Lewis is just so cute.

1373
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:59,220
What's he thinking?

1374
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:00,280
What?

1375
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:02,420
What are you doing?

1376
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:04,740
I want to sleep more.

1377
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:06,740
What are you looking at?

1378
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:12,740
What is this?

1379
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:14,740
You're wearing a embarrassing costume.

1380
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:21,740
Have you ever dressed like this?

1381
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:22,740
No.

1382
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:24,740
This is the first time.

1383
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:27,740
What are you going to do?

1384
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:28,740
Wait a minute.

1385
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:30,740
I'll put it in.

1386
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:46,740
This is amazing.

1387
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:52,740
You can see everything.

1388
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:56,740
I've never seen anything like this in a video.

1389
02:16:57,740 --> 02:16:58,740
Amazing.

1390
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:00,740
It's always better than being sick, right?

1391
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:05,740
Where did you learn this?

1392
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:07,740
Amazing.

1393
02:17:10,740 --> 02:17:12,740
Ai-chan, don't.

1394
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:14,740
Are you going to die?

1395
02:17:15,740 --> 02:17:16,740
Be careful.

1396
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:19,740
No.

1397
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,740
You have to go to the hospital.

1398
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:24,740
I got it.

1399
02:17:30,740 --> 02:17:31,740
More.

1400
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:32,740
More.

1401
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:35,740
It feels so good.

1402
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:41,740
Oh, no.

1403
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:46,740
More.

1404
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:48,740
More.

1405
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:50,740
It feels so good.

1406
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:55,240
Mami, show me your face!

1407
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:04,640
Go!

1408
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:06,640
One more time.

1409
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:23,640
It's hot.

1410
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:25,640
It feels good.

1411
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:29,640
I'm sweating a lot.

1412
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:35,640
It's the first time for me. I'm glad.

1413
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:37,640
I'm happy.

1414
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:39,640
It's the first time for me.

1415
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:41,640
I'm happy.

1416
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:45,640
I want to be a husband.

1417
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:47,640
I love you.

1418
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:49,640
I love you.

1419
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,640
I love you.

1420
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:52,640
I'm sorry.

1421
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:07,440
Let me try from the back.

1422
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:13,140
From the back?

1423
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:15,540
From behind...

1424
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:22,920
Right here.

1425
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,520
Let's finish.

1426
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:31,220
Here.

1427
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:34,720
Let's put these back in.

1428
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,160
No.

1429
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:37,700
Right, here.

1430
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:40,540
Aw...

1431
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:45,540
I feel so good.

1432
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:52,540
Why am I so sleepy?

1433
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:54,540
I'm doing a good job.

1434
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,540
I'm tired.

1435
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:06,540
Oh, no.

1436
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:11,540
Oh, no.

1437
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:14,540
Oh, no.

1438
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:16,540
Oh, no.

1439
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:18,540
Mom...

1440
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:25,540
I'm tired.

1441
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:28,540
Mom, stay here.

1442
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:30,540
I'm tired.

1443
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,540
I'm sorry.

1444
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:36,540
I'm sorry.

1445
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,540
I'm sorry.

1446
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:12,540
No, I'm still a baby.

1447
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:17,540
Don't be so mean.

1448
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:21,540
I've gotten a lot better.

1449
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:24,540
Thank you so much.

1450
02:23:25,540 --> 02:23:27,540
I'm going to go.

1451
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:29,540
Are you going to go?

1452
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:30,540
No.

1453
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:36,540
I want you to feel better inside of me.

1454
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:45,540
Let me know when you feel better.

1455
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:51,540
It's okay.

1456
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,540
How do you feel?

1457
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:58,540
Minji...

1458
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:02,540
Minji...

1459
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:04,540
I'm sorry.

1460
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:23,540
I can't touch your hand.

1461
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:24,540
I'm sorry.

1462
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:30,540
I'm sorry.

1463
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:35,540
Nana.

1464
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:38,540
I'm sorry.

1465
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:40,540
Nana.

1466
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:43,540
I'm sorry.

1467
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:45,540
I'm sorry.

1468
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:48,540
I'm sorry.

1469
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:58,540
I want to go to the bathroom, but I can't go to the bathroom, so I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1470
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:03,540
It's cold.

1471
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:14,540
It's cold.

1472
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:19,540
Where should I put it?

1473
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,540
You can take it out.

1474
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:25,540
Do you want to take it out?

1475
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:26,540
Do you want to take it out?

1476
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:27,540
Do you want to take it out?

1477
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:28,540
No.

1478
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:31,540
I want to take it out where you like.

1479
02:26:32,540 --> 02:26:34,540
Give me the first one.

1480
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:35,540
What?

1481
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:37,540
I can't do it anymore

1482
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,540
Let's go.

1483
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:13,540
I think I'm going to die.

1484
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:14,540
Are you going?

1485
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:15,540
No.

1486
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,880
Please take care of him.

1487
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,280
Be careful.

1488
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:22,060
Okay.

1489
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:29,420
Ooops.

1490
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:31,060
That's fine.

1491
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,940
Let's go to the cinema.

1492
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,560
Why are you article 2?

1493
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:43,780
Turkey Sorry.

1494
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:17,520
Is he there?

1495
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:30,780
Hello?

1496
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:34,580
Sorry, can you ignore me?

1497
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:41,740
I don't know whether to restart or not.

1498
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:43,740
I'll tell you when I get home.

1499
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:54,740
I'm busy now, so I'll call you again.

1500
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:55,740
Hmm?

1501
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:56,740
Hmm?

1502
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:59,740
Well, I'm free, but...

1503
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:03,740
I'm busy killing time.

1504
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:47,740
I can't do this anymore, Nara-chan. Please forgive me.

1505
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:49,740
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1506
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:19,740
Thank you for watching.
