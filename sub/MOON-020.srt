1
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm home.

2
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Welcome home.

3
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,130
Thank you.

4
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,430
Go ahead.

5
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,680
Did anything interesting
happen at work today?

6
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
Did you have any strange
customers? As usual.

7
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,810


8
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,560
Electricity, shoes,

9
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,580
Electricity, shoes, laundry.

10
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,320
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

11
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,740
I've heard that before.

12
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,220
I want to talk about
something fun when I'm eating.

13
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,060
Don't you want to go on a
trip next month? I'm sorry.

14
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,620
I don't feel like that even
if you say it suddenly.

15
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
I see. I'm sorry.

16
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,410
You know,

17
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,711
I don't want to say this because
I don't want to get into a fight,

18
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,850
but you have to keep your promise.

19
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,041
When you come home, you leave
the lights on everywhere in the house.

20
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,821
You don't have your shoes on.

21
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,890
You leave the laundry out.

22
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,841
The electric bill is not free.

23
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,090
I'm sorry.

24
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,340
You don't keep your promise no
matter how many times I tell you.

25
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,400
But you don't have to be so angry.

26
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,406
I'm telling you to keep your promise.

27
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,730
If you don't keep your
promise, you'll be worried

28
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:07,080
that you'll be cheated
again. Don't you know that?

29
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,760
I know, but I swore to Yamato that I
wouldn't cheat. I'm keeping my promise.

30
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,001
When did you talk about it?
It was three years ago.

31
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,060
It's been three years,
so it doesn't matter.

32
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,421
I've kept my promise not to cheat on you.

33
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,380
If you insist, I can't see what's inside.

34
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,920
I don't want to see it.

35
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
I'm going to bed.

36
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,080
Wash it and throw it away.

37
00:07:46,740 --> 00:09:37,560
Are you awake?

38
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,310
I'm sorry about today.

39
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
I'll be careful from tomorrow.

40
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,820
I'm sorry I said too much.

41
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,730
Do you want to go on a trip next month?

42
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,850
Yes.

43
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,790
Please look up some candidates.

44
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Okay.

45
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,760
Can I talk to you for a moment?

46
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,910
Yes.

47
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,580
Thank you for choosing a
convenience store today.

48
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,380
I know.

49
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,170
Thank you.

50
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I made up with you.

51
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,100
It's not a kiss.

52
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,090
I think I feel like that today.

53
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,870
I think so, too.

54
00:16:43,560 --> 00:18:10,400
It's been a long time.

55
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Yeah.

56
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,110
Don't you want to take
a shower? No, I'm fine.

57
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,070


58
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:10,240
It felt good, but I need to
get in the mood a little more.

59
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,580
I'll go take a shower.

60
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,300
Good night.

61
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,080
You heard everything
today, didn't you? Yes, I did.

62
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
Let's eat.

63
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,520


64
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,970
Hey, don't flush the water.

65
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:13,971
Don't let it out.

66
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,500
Can you be a little more gentle?

67
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,200
Not gentle, but careful.

68
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,450
I don't know if it breaks suddenly.

69
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,300
It's white. You can tell by the smell.

70
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,820
I don't know.

71
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,520
Even if I know, I don't
know if I shouldn't let it out.

72
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,800
I don't know.

73
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,540
Don't you understand if I
don't tell you everything?

74
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,300
I'd like to, but...

75
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
I'll tell you next time.

76
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
But you'll make the same mistake again.

77
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,810
I've told you so many times
about the weather and the laundry.

78
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,940
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

79
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:57,450
Do you think I haven't kept
my promise not to cheat on you?

80
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,290
I've been telling you that I haven't.

81
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,790
I don't have any proof.

82
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,630
What the hell are you doing?

83
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,350
Are you here to fight at home?

84
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,230
No, I just want to have fun with you.

85
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,820
But you're always the one
who says something like a fight.

86
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,290
Then please be careful not to do that.

87
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,625
I'll be careful from tomorrow.

88
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,030
You always try to end
the conversation like that.

89
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,890
You don't protect me.

90
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,068
I want to forgive you
for cheating on me, but

91
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,820
I'm worried if you don't
keep your promise.

92
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,150
It's hard for me to be
suspected every time I don't do it.

93
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,790
It's hard for me too.

94
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:50,791
I don't want to do it! Fine.

95
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,090


96
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,650
You can cheat on me again.

97
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,410
I did it, too.

98
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,870
What are you talking about?

99
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,750
I didn't say that.

100
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,990
You don't understand me at all.

101
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,480
I'm telling you that you
can do the same thing.

102
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,040
I don't want to cheat on you.

103
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
I don't think so.

104
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,920
When I cheated on you,
we talked a lot, didn't we?

105
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Yes.

106
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,040
I thought I'd get a divorce
when I knew I'd cheated on you.

107
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,600
But you tried so hard to forgive
me, so I decided not to get a divorce.

108
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,100
I don't know why I decided to do it.

109
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
You're right.

110
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
What if I cheat on you?

111
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,190
I won't get mad at you.

112
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,790
But I might get a divorce.

113
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm not hungry anymore.

114
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,240
I'm going to take a shower.

115
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,300
In the middle of the night.

116
00:29:12,750 --> 00:33:03,120
Are you Ms.

117
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,400
Akarin? Yes, I am.

118
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Are you Ms.

119
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,160
Kanayan? Yes, I am.

120
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,410
Good evening.

121
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Nice to meet you.

122
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
You are very beautiful.

123
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
Not at all.

124
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,560
I have made a reservation at the
restaurant you were talking about.

125
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Shall we go? Yes, please.

126
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200


127
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,820
It's about five minutes from here.

128
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:21,880
It's close.

129
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,960
Gratin is famous here.

130
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,320
I want to try it.

131
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,720
It's this way, so let's go.

132
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:31,140
Did you like Japanese
food better? I like both.

133
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,060


134
00:33:53,490 --> 00:34:05,330
I ate a lot, so I'm hungry.

135
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,710
Me too. It was delicious.

136
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,310
I'm glad you liked it.

137
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,170
There was a lot of seafood in it.
It was delicious.

138
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,250
Thank you very much.

139
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,910
Have you ever been to a
hotel with this kind of app?

140
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,230
No, you said it was your
first time to use an app.

141
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,130
Yes, I wanted to try it.

142
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,750
You must be curious.

143
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Yes, I am.

144
00:35:47,960 --> 00:37:00,250
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying.

145
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,251
The baby is crying.

146
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,880
The baby is crying.

147
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,520
The baby is crying.

148
00:37:18,545 --> 00:38:08,700
Thank you very much.

149
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:37,740
Ms. Akarin, you were amazing.

150
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,080
I'm glad.

151
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,560
Did you feel good?

152
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,480
Yes.

153
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,840
Was there anything wrong?

154
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,471
Did something happen between you two?

155
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,100
No, it's not like that.

156
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:09,280
The reason why we met like this today...

157
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,080
My husband cheated on me before.

158
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,440
I forgave him.

159
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:26,120
When we had a fight the
other day, I said to him,

160
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:31,740
「I cheated on you, so you
should cheat on me, too.

161
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
」 Yes.

162
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,490
That's why I'm here today.

163
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:44,230
That's why I came here.

164
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,220
I came here because I wanted to know
how my husband felt when he threw up.

165
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,260
I felt like I was disconnected.

166
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
I don't know what to say.

167
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,120
I'm sorry.

168
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:27,680
I'm sorry.

169
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,080
No, it's okay.

170
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,890
If you want to see me
again, please contact me.

171
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,030
Thank you.

172
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
Yes.

173
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
夜中、。 I'm home.

174
00:41:09,250 --> 00:47:37,160
I'm home.

175
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,700


176
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,011
It's rare to see you here.

177
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,860
Hey, can I talk to you
after I change my clothes?

178
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,671
Why are you looking at me like that?

179
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:49,830
I cheated on you.

180
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
What?

181
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,840
I said I could cheat on you, so I did.

182
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,301
How far did you cheat
on me? Until the end.

183
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,610


184
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,030
Do you have any questions?

185
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:20,431
Is there anything you want to know?

186
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,081
What kind of person was she?

187
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,070
Do you want to know?

188
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,530
Aren't you jealous?

189
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,470
Of what you've done for me.

190
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,590
Of this feeling.

191
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,670
You know...

192
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,970
Shall we... Get a divorce?

193
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,430
What?

194
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,621
I thought about it when you cheated on me.

195
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,641
I thought about it when you
told me I could cheat on you.

196
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,300
I thought about it when you cheated on me.

197
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,510
I don't like it.

198
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
I'm stubborn.

199
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,690
I see.

200
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,490
We cheated on each other.

201
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,350
I won't be lenient with you.

202
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:25,360
I don't care. I've changed.

203
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,230
I don't want to get a divorce.

204
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,250
But I have the right to
say that I cheated on you.

205
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,661
I don't want to change Akari's mind.

206
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,700
I don't have the right to say that.

207
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,389
I'm going to write it
because it's important, but

208
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,320
instead of writing it,
can I say one condition?

209
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,980
What is it?

210
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:30,470
Don't have sex at the end.

211
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,350
Why?

212
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,430
If I write this and submit
it, I'll be a stranger, right?

213
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,850
I like Akari, and I can't get
along with others so quickly.

214
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:52,270
I feel like I'll be cut off
if I have sex at the end.

215
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,591
I thought you'd say something else.

216
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,460
You don't have to write to me.

217
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,000
Really?

218
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,180
But you know what?

219
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,260
If you're going to do it, let's
have a sex that feels good.

220
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,860
And?

221
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,700
I want you to make me regret.

222
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,770
I can't have sex with such a good woman.

223
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,320
I understand.

224
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,260
I'll make you regret.

225
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:50,261
I'll do it for you.

226
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
OK.

227
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,051
If you take a shower, you'll catch a cold.

228
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,190
What?

229
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,620
Even if you sleep every
day, you smell so smooth.

230
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,520
It's good.

231
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:55,340
What's that? Are you cheating on me?

232
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,260
No, it's a spare.

233
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:57,800
Give me a kiss.

234
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,540
Give me a kiss.

235
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,150
You are very wet.

236
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,200
Give me a kiss.

237
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,010
Give me a kiss.

238
01:03:18,460 --> 01:04:03,300
I'm going to work out.

239
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:20,030
I'm tired.

240
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,000
It's longer than usual, isn't it?

241
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,060
What did you think of that man?

242
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,040
Why do you want to know?

243
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,880
If you do that, I'll ask you, too.

244
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,670
You're full of lies.

245
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,430
Get out of my way.

246
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,940
It feels so good.

247
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,840
Hey, relax.

248
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:09,170
Can't you do it?

249
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:44,660
You want to regret
it, don't you? I'm sorry.

250
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,120


251
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:33,810
If you were a good boy,
we could have sex forever.

252
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:36,430
Right?

253
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:30,100
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

254
01:10:32,085 --> 01:10:55,270
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

255
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:38,570
I'm going to make a mood.

256
01:12:04,760 --> 01:13:14,570
I'm going to make a mood.

257
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,720
It's the last one.

258
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,000
I'm determined to win.

259
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,060
I was so close to win.

260
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,400
I was so nervous.

261
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,920
I felt so good.

262
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:47,130
Can you go home?

263
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,740
I'll do it tomorrow.

264
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,180
I have to work until
night, so I'll do it today.

265
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,200
Today?

266
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,620
I'll go if you change,
but let's go together.

267
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,820
OK.

268
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,240
OK, let's change.

269
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:18,980
It's hot.

270
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,960
It's humid.

271
01:19:21,235 --> 01:19:27,680
I remember walking like
this when we were dating.

272
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,680
What? A memory talk?

273
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,860
It's a good time.

274
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:34,751
It's been a long time since I laughed.

275
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,180
It's a good time.

276
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,820
When we first dated,

277
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,760
Akari was so drunk that it was
dangerous to walk on the street at night.

278
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:46,980
Do you remember?

279
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:51,080
I think I was excited.

280
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,110
Why?

281
01:19:54,430 --> 01:20:13,490
I have to take off my ring.

282
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,410
Oh, I see.

283
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:23,870
It's strange, isn't it?

284
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:25,650
If I wear a ring.

285
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,670
I think so.

286
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,391
What do you do with this ring?

287
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,420
Do you want to sell it?

288
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,340
No, I don't want to.

289
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:46,926
It looks like it has electricity in it.

290
01:20:51,315 --> 01:20:54,820
By the way, did you bring the
divorce certificate? Yes, I did.

291
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,100


292
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:00,350
What?

293
01:21:02,485 --> 01:21:03,766
I told you to put it at the end.

294
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,170
Why is it like this?

295
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,990
Is it okay?

296
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:08,770
No, it's impossible.

297
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:12,490
The letters are torn here.

298
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:20,090
I don't think they'll take it.

299
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,270
It's impossible.

300
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:23,970
Let's rewrite it.

301
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:29,670
There's a new one, but
it's too far to go home.

302
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,150
What should I do?

303
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,470
Isn't there a cafe around here?

304
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,211
I don't want to go to a cafe.

305
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,471
It's embarrassing to be seen
writing something like this.

306
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,570
Then there's a good place.

307
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:41,810
Let's write there.

308
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,290
Really? Yeah.

309
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:43,850


310
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,790
Oh, I thought I put it in properly.

311
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,210
Be firm.

312
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,270
Until the end.

313
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,870
It's true.

314
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:36,780
Please check the delivery of divorce.

315
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:38,820
Isn't it too dirty?

316
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,340
I thought this is the only
place that can't be seen.

317
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,840
Well, let's go.

318
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,760
Do you want something
to drink? No, I'm fine.

319
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,900


320
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,700
I don't want my hair to get dirty.

321
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,130
Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine.

322
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,350


323
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,410
It's been a while since
we've been to a small hotel.

324
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:49,030
The last time we went to a
small hotel was 5 or 6 years ago.

325
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:51,650
We went to see the sea in Fukui.

326
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:53,766
It was so delicious that I
could see the sea of the sea.

327
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:54,750
Yes, it was.

328
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:55,751
The crab was delicious.

329
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,350
It was so delicious.

330
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:03,031
It was in the middle of winter,
but the heater didn't work at all.

331
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,130
It was amazing, wasn't it?

332
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:07,630
It was on all the time.

333
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:09,050
Yes, it was.

334
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,430
Even today, there was only a breeze.

335
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:15,070
Yes, it was.

336
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,350
It was so cold that we
were hugging each other.

337
01:24:18,351 --> 01:24:27,200
Are you going to buy a dojo
and not let me get a divorce?

338
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,840
I'm not going to do that.

339
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,920
I'm going to get a divorce.

340
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,620
OK, go home.

341
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:51,580
OK.

342
01:24:58,770 --> 01:24:59,770
I have a condition.

343
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,080
What?

344
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:07,560
I'm still alive, so I'm going to
have sex with you at the end.

345
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,240
Are you going to do
it again? That's right.

346
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,800


347
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,180
I'm going to do it again.

348
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:19,951
Otherwise, I won't write it.

349
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,060
You just want to have sex.

350
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,140
It doesn't matter if I want to have sex.

351
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:30,091
I've always wanted to break up.

352
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,651
But I've been fighting all
the time since I got home.

353
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,720
Well, it's bad because I'm here.

354
01:25:35,721 --> 01:25:39,680
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
earlier, but I still wanted to do it.

355
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,740
You should have told me earlier.

356
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:10,770
This is the last time.

357
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,480
Do you want to do it here?

358
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,480
Let's go to bed.

359
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,380
Akari.

360
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,500
Yes?

361
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,860
It's the last night, so
let's have the best sex.

362
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,050
What's that line?

363
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,660
You're the worst.

364
01:27:47,180 --> 01:28:22,920
Do you want to see it soon?

365
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,420
Yes.

366
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:27,420
Okay.

367
01:28:42,575 --> 01:28:45,200
You don't know how to
take off your clothes, do you?

368
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,300
Do you know? Do your best.

369
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,680


370
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:55,940
I'll do it for you.

371
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,670
You are so kind today.

372
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,270
You are so kind.

373
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,820
Sometimes it hurts a little.

374
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,180
Does it feel good here?

375
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,680
Yes.

376
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,800
Really?

377
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,660
Who invented it?

378
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,160
It's you, isn't
it? No, it's not.

379
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,381
It wasn't like that.

380
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:34,090
It's the last one, so I'll do it for you.

381
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,580
It's stained.

382
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:44,300
I hate selfishness.

383
01:33:44,301 --> 01:33:45,340
I really hate it.

384
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:47,960
Hey.

385
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:51,420
Remember Lady First.

386
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,300
Okay?

387
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,340
Hey.

388
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:09,400
If you don't remember that, you'll make her
sad forever. Do you understand? I understand.

389
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:10,830


390
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,180
You don't understand.

391
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,450
How do you feel?

392
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,870
Are you comfortable?

393
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,150
Yes, I'm comfortable.

394
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:50,100
I like being licked by Akari the most.

395
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,380
That's why I'm late.

396
01:38:17,781 --> 01:38:18,781
Oh, it's hot.

397
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,310
What?

398
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:48,830
I don't have a rubber band.

399
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:56,610
Do you? Yes, I do.

400
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:58,010


401
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:14,140
Why do you always have it?

402
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,140
I just happen to have it.

403
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,280
You must be lying. You're keeping it.

404
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,500
Akari always tells me to put it on.

405
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:26,031
Of course she tells you to put it on.

406
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:30,400
Unlike you, she does it properly.

407
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:35,180
Hey, did you put a rubber
band around your armpit?

408
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:36,220
What?

409
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:36,760
What? Of course not.

410
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,600
You're lying.

411
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,720


412
01:39:40,745 --> 01:39:41,920
You're lying, aren't you?

413
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:24,800
This is the last one.

414
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:26,760
Of course.

415
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,170
This is the last one.

416
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:49,310
Oh, it's good.

417
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:13,500
It feels good.

418
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:33,750
I can't do it.

419
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:36,050
I can't do it.

420
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:47,660
It feels good.

421
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:51,860
It feels good.

422
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:23,130
I want to do it more.

423
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:41,970
It feels good.

424
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:28,710
Give me a kiss.

425
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,780
Feels good.

426
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:39,450
What? Feels good.

427
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:43,320
Feels good.

428
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:47,070
Feels good.

429
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:06,620
Feels good.

430
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,680
Give me a kiss.

431
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:43,600


432
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:50,110
Make it stronger.

433
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:56,220
Do it like a wind.

434
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:36,640
It feels good.

435
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:06,980
It's funny.

436
01:47:08,485 --> 01:47:11,080
I'm having sex, but I can't get a divorce.

437
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:14,360
I'll never do it again.

438
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,500
Isn't it too funny?

439
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,400
I don't want to have sex with you.

440
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,061
What are you talking about?

441
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,100
You're the worst.

442
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:38,940
What's that? It's not bad.

443
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,680

447
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:05,330
You want to go to bed, don't you?

448
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,790
Are you going to sleep with this?

449

452
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:18,780
Oh, it feels so good.

453
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:30,240
Oh, it feels so good.

454
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:52,570
This is the last one. Thank you.

455
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:05,020
Oh, it feels so good.

456
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,540
Hey, do you want to do this?

457
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,240
I wanted to do this.

458
01:57:17,075 --> 01:57:19,140
Don't do it like an experiment.

459
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:24,061
It's the last one, so please forgive me.

460
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:26,400
Then, I'll give you a lot.

461
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:46,550
You're always like this.

462
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:51,910
Oh, my God.

463
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,990
Oh, my God?

464
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:03,780
But, you know, I was sick the other day.

465
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:19,360
But, you know, my head feels good.

466
01:58:22,595 --> 01:58:23,920
I'll never say it again.

467
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:26,940
Why are you laughing?
Well, you know.

468
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,920
..

469
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:35,920
You know, I've been working
with a guy for a long time.

470
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:39,900
Suddenly, he came into my life.

471
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:43,740
I don't know.

472
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,700
It's strange, isn't it?

473
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:52,860
What's with that face?

474
01:58:54,620 --> 01:59:00,100
You look like you just got off
work, but there's still some left.

475
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:01,200
What? Over there.

476
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,360


477
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:02,960
What?

478
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,280
Marriage certificate.

479
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:05,520
What?

480
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:07,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

481
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,920
Wait, wait, wait.

482
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:10,680
Ah! No, no, no.

483
01:59:10,681 --> 01:59:11,681
Here.

484
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:12,880
Yes.

485
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,480
Please keep your promise.

486
01:59:17,790 --> 01:59:19,246
There's something to do
before you go to the shower.

487
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:33,530
Don't mess it up again.

488
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:35,310
It's okay.

489
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:43,830
How do you feel about the last sex?

490
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:46,190
It was the best.

491
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:50,670
What's that?

492
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:57,390
It was the most comfortable I've ever had.

493
01:59:58,850 --> 01:59:59,850
Really? You know, men.

494
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:04,480
..

495
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,001
...feel sorry for you at
times like this, don't they?

496
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,541
Well, I'm going to take a shower.

497
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,090
You were able to get out safely.

498
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:31,070
Yes, I was.

499
02:01:32,690 --> 02:01:34,570
Now that I'm out, I feel much better.

500
02:01:34,571 --> 02:01:35,571
I was surprised.

501
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:43,170
Let's go there and talk.

502
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:52,471
We used to go to the park at night.

503
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:56,420
Yes, we did.

504
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,041
Even though we had nothing.

505
02:01:58,470 --> 02:01:59,470
We didn't have money.

506
02:02:00,270 --> 02:02:01,270
You're right.

507
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:07,190
It was fun.

508
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:08,191
It was raining a lot.

509
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:10,901
Sometimes it seems to get entangled.

510
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:12,670
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

511
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,641
It was very early for us to run away.

512
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:16,350
Is it okay today?

513
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:18,470
It was raining yesterday.

514
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:21,010
Yes, it is.

515
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:22,861
It's a strange weather today.

516
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,510
Yes, it is.

517
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:25,270
It's sunny and rainy.

518
02:02:25,570 --> 02:02:27,130
Yes, yes, yes. It's been a lot lately.

519
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:31,810
Do you want to sit down a little?

520
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,190
Yes.

521
02:02:52,710 --> 02:02:53,990
Unexpectedly, it was refreshing.

522
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,250
Yeah.

523
02:02:56,330 --> 02:02:57,330
You know,

524
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,810
the man at the reception at night,

525
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:01,690
he was like,

526
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:02,250
yes, yes,

527
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:03,510
and it was over in a second.

528
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:06,970
At the reception,

529
02:03:08,665 --> 02:03:09,810
he was bright and smiling.

530
02:03:11,110 --> 02:03:12,110
Yeah.

531
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:13,410
That's why it was
good, like this.

532
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:14,810
Maybe.

533
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:18,250


534
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:29,181
What are you going to do now?

535
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:34,240
I haven't decided yet.
I'll think about it when I wake up.

536
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:35,760
I have to find a house.

537
02:03:38,085 --> 02:03:39,206
Let's talk about that later.

538
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,720
I'm going to clean up the house.

539
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:47,771
You can leave the electricity
and air conditioner on.

540
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,060
I don't want to.

541
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:51,161
I've been raising public funds lately.

542
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,240
Thank you for your hard work.

543
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:04,240
What are you going
to do? This? Yeah.

544
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:09,900


545
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:11,600


546
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:18,810
Throw it?

547
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:22,510
Yeah, that's good.

548
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:25,230
Let's do that.

549
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:26,790
Wait a minute.

550
02:04:34,775 --> 02:04:35,400
Let's go with one, two.

551
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:35,840
Let's go together.

552
02:04:36,190 --> 02:04:38,600
OK, I'll definitely make you fly far away.

553
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,320
OK, let's go.

554
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,640
OK.

555
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:44,790
One, two.

556
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:52,700
It's the last joint work.

557
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:54,700
It went well.

558
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:56,240
Right?

559
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:04,240
Thank you for everything.

560
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:05,750
Thank you, too.

561
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:08,740
Be happy.

562
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,680
Akari Mama.

563
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:20,730
Bye-bye.
