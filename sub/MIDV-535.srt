1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,871
Thank you for your hard
work until the late shooting.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,300
Thank you for your hard work.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,140
You look a little gloomy.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,260
Do I look gloomy?

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,580
I have only one reason.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,711
Please introduce yourself to the camera.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,440
Hello, everyone. I'm Ibuki Aoi.

8
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,800
Ibuki Aoi, how are you?

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm fine.

10
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,860
How long has it been
since you made your debut?

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,300
It's been about 3 years.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,456
How many videos have you made so far?

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
About 30 videos.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,460
You're a veteran.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
No, I'm not.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm a newbie.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Are you enjoying the shooting?

18
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,450
Yes, I am.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,440
Can you tell us about today's shooting?

20
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,560
I'd like you to tell me about your date.

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,460
It's a 24-hour date with a man.

22
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm going to have sex until the morning.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,210
I see.

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,980
I'd like you to tell me about your date.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,840
Can you tell us about
your first impression?

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
My first impression?

27
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,930
Well...

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,140
It was the so-called MO-kun.

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700
He was my opponent.

30
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,400
I was wondering how it would be.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,300
I think I was able to ride in a
good wave from the middle.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,540
It was really fun.

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,140
Did you ride in a good wave?

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,680
I rode in a good wave.

35
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,681
I hope so.

36
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:51,560
If you have any memorable
scenes or highlights, please tell us.

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,440
Memorable scenes and highlights?

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,320
Well, it's a rare thing,
so I don't have a script.

39
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,960
So I think I can enjoy
watching such scenes.

40
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:07,820
I think you can enjoy
watching it today as well.

41
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:19,250
The main part of this work will start soon,
so please send a message to the viewers.

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,250
The date scene is very
fresh and I can see it,

43
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:34,610
so please don't fast forward
and watch until the end!

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,930
Please!

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
Ta-da!

46
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,980
Hello!

47
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,500
I'm Aoi Ibuki!

48
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Yay!

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Today,

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:12,280
I got this camera I heard that you can go
on a date with a guy just the two of you.

51
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,870
I'm nervous to go on a
date just the two of us.

52
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,770
I don't know what kind of person will come.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
I have no idea who will come.

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Who will it be?

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,920
I want someone who is easy to talk to.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,340
Someone who is fun to be with.

57
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Because it's a date.

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:52,180
So, let's go to the place where we
are going to meet up with my friends!

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Let's go!

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,020
I made it to the place where we
are going to meet up with my friends.

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,940
I can't see them at all.

62
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,660
I feel like I'm the only one who's waiting.

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,120
It's not good to make a girl wait.

64
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,380
If you're a man, you should
have arrived at the place first.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,780
Shouldn't you be waiting?

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,760
Oh, there you are!

67
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,700
there he is!

68
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:54,061
there he is hello.

69
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,940
today's date today's date.

70
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,660
it's been a while yeah it's
been a year how are you I'm

71
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,061
good how are you today's
date Aizawa I'm Aizawa-kun.

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,160
Is it okay to call you Aizawa-kun?

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
It's okay.

74
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,180
I'm Aizawa-kun.

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,220
You're so small.

76
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,400
You're not in the frame.

77
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,610
You're beautiful.

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,360
I don't like it.

79
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,580
I was waiting for you.

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,200
Did you wait for me?

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,220
Yes, I did.

82
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,221
Did you mix it well?

83
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,540
I think a man's clothes
should be decided first.

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
It's sudden, isn't it?

85
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,440
After this, it's half and half.

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,400
Let's take a two-shot in commemoration.

87
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,920
Is it okay if I take it?

88
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:09,680
Can you hold this for me?

89
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,820
I parked my car here Oh, you parked
your car here Yes, I parked my car here

90
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:23,160
I have a lot of things to
show you Aizawa-kun's.

91
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,680
I have a lot of places I want to go.

92
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,480
You have a lot of places you want
to go to Places you want to go to?

93
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:35,340
Yes, I have a lot of
places I want to go to.

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,840
Let's decide what to wear.

95
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,220
There is a big park nearby.

96
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,600
Did you look it up?

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Yes, I did.

98
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,460
It's like a date.

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,580
I like this style.

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,720
This is cute.

101
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,800
How is it?

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,760
It's very cute.

103
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,940
I think it's a little cheap, but it's cute.

104
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
It's super cute.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,620
That's the problem.

106
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,820
Let's go straight.

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh, I was escorted.

108
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,460
Thank you.

109
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,660
I'll close it.

110
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,760
I'm going to go to a big park.

111
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,520
Oh, a park.

112
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,620
Let's go there.

113
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,400
Let's go.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,060
Let's go There is
also a aquarium.

115
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,780
Oh, wow.

116
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,040
Let's go to Aizawa-kun's
date plan Oh, I see.

117
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll buy some food and go on a picnic.

118
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Sounds good.

119
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
It's like a date.

120
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,100
Yes, it is.

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,500
Did you think about it?

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Yes, I did.

123
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,160
That's cute.

124
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,740
You thought about it.

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Yes, I did.

126
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,560
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

You have a driver's license.

134
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,380
I don't think you have a driver's license.

135
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,280
I got it right away.

136
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Right away?

137
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,520
When I was 18 years old.

138
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,740
When you were 18 years old?

139
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes.

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm going to a driving school right now.

141
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Is that so?

142
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,100
I feel like I lost.

143
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,960

144

You have a driver's license.

145
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:24,920
Have you ever thought
about where you want to go?

146
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Where do you want to go?

147
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,800
Where do you want to go?

148
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
Are you nervous?

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Your legs are beautiful.

150
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,740
What are you looking at?

151
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,260
Because it's a mini skirt?

152
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,261
I don't know.

153
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,600
Please concentrate
on driving I will.

154
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,440
But we are alone in the car.

155
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,000

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,700
Oh, that kind of thing?

167
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Yeah, that kind of thing.

168
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm happy with that.

169
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,640
Oh, really? Then let's do that.

170
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Let's do that.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
It's a good memory.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a good memory.

173
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,200
Well, it depends on Aizawa-kun, right?

174
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
It depends on me.

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm late, so I'm
going to... That's right.

176
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,500
Kusatsu Onsen is a good place.

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,920
I've never been to Kusatsu Onsen.

178
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Oh, really?

179
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
I think so.

180
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,540
It's a good place to
go if you're not in a car.

181
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,620
Onsen has a sexy sound.

182
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:34,720
There is a place called Yubatake
which is 300m away from here.

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,380
There are so many butterflies.

184
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
What?

185
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,800
Do your best to speak.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,120
What?

187
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,420
You are blabbering.

188
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,480
When I go to the beach at night,

189
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,860
there are a lot of people,

190
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,600
and I feel like I'm in a fairy tale.

191
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,560
I see.

192
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,960
You were able to talk.

193
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,020
We talked a lot.

194
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:25,420
Wearing a yukata and
going on a date is the best.

195
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,360
With whom?

196
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,700
Please look forward to the sequel.

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,840
It's up to you.

199
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:47,841
I don't know.

200
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
The park.

201
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,480
It feels good to walk in the park.

202
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,640
What?

203
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,500
It feels good to walk in the park.

204
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,540
Don't look at me.

205
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
Don't look at me.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,420
Don't look at my thighs.

207
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:21,260
Your legs are longer than Aizawa-kun's.

208
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,100
Maybe longer than Aizawa-kun's.

209
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,800
Maybe longer than Aizawa-kun's.

210
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:30,460
How tall are you?

211
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,900
158 cm.

212
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,860
So small!

213
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,860
So cute!

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,040
You're 158 cm tall.

215
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,620
It's cute.

216
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Mr. Aoi.

217
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Can I call you Ibuki?

218
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,900
Yes, you can.

219
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,320
How many centimeters is it?

220
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,040
163 centimeters.

221
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
It's 5 centimeters.

222
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,960
It's like a model size.

223
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,380
What is it?

224
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,540
Can I praise you?

225
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,821
If you compliment me, I'm happy.

226
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,140
If you compliment me, I'm happy.

227
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,580
But it's true.

228
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
It's true.

229
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,460
I forgot to put out a wink.

230
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,620
Concentrate.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,900
You're doing it in the same way.

232
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Don't you come here often?

233
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,120
I don't come here often.

234
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,380
You don't come here often?

235
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
Sometimes I come here for cosplay events.

236
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
Oh, Big Saito?

237
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,460
Yes, Big Saito.

238
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,100
Like Comiket?

239
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Yes.

240
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,040
Are you going to cosplay?

241
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,240
I want to.

242
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,420
Why?

243
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
You should.

244
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Like a baker.

245
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,860
Oh, a baker.

246
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm from the factory.

247
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I'm Koushi.

248
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,580
I'm Koushi.

249
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,000
Most of them are anime characters.

250
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,420
Please look forward and drive.

251
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,630
It's not shiny.

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Is it fun to drive?

253
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,630
It's fun.

254
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,610
You say it's fun because I'm next to you.

255
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,190
That's right.

256
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,490
Because you're next to me.

257
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:56,290
It's fun to have a dog next to you.

258
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,850
That's what a popular man is.

259
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,250
Can I go back in time?

260
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,630
It's too late.

261
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,430
I'm driving now.

262
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,110
I wonder if this is okay.

263
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,830
I think the picnic will be canceled.

264
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,170
Thank you for your hard work.

265
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,331
Thank you for your hard work.

266
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,190
Thank you for your hard work, too.

267
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,110
It's too hard for me.

268
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,370
I can't be with you.

269
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,670
Mental damage?

270
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,030
Mental damage.

271
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,310
I can't be with you.

272
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,910
I don't know how to make you enjoy today.

273
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,250
I've been thinking about it.

274
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,950
I heard that there is also a aquarium.

275
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,290
Because it's close to the sea.

276
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,170
Do you like aquariums?

277
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,030
Do you like aquariums?

278
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,630
I'm not good at it.

279
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,830
I'm not good at it either.

280
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,570
Which one do you like?

281
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,770
You just said you like it.

282
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:18,771
I just said that.

283
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,570
Well... The bottom...
Well... What?

284
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,890
The bottom part is old.

285
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,110
I don't know which one it is.

286
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,986
By the way, what's the
reason you don't like it?

287
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,670
The reason I don't like it
is... I'm afraid of the sea.

288
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,070
I'm afraid of the ocean.

289
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,910
I'm fine with the sea I'm looking at.

290
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,570
The surface of the sea.

291
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,030
I see.

292
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,310
In the sea.

293
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,430
In the dark water.

294
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:48,190
I don't like sharks. I'm afraid of them.

295
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,970
I see.

296
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:53,190
I hate sharks the most in the world.

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,910
I see.

298
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,970
I'm afraid of ghosts, but I
can watch scary images.

299
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,610
But I can't watch sharks.

300
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,350
Do you mean sharks?

301
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,130
Not only sharks.

302
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,370
I don't really like the view from here.

303
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:28,570
It's deep and dark.

304
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,690
I can't reach my feet.

305
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,610
I see.

306
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,490
I thought it was a scary place
where you can't reach your feet.

307
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,430
I think it's okay.

308
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,850
The pool is okay.

309
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Did you make a mistake?

310
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,790
Are you in a hurry?

311
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,791
What are you doing?

312
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
What?

314
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,600
Did you make a mistake?

315
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,790
I want to tease you.

316
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,550
You made a mistake even
if you didn't say it strictly.

317
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,190
It's obvious.

318
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,750
It's obvious mistake.

319
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,460
How will you fix it?

320
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm confused.

321
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,500
Confused?

322
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,500
Do you have a Ferris wheel?

323
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,460
Do you have a Ferris wheel?

324
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Oh.

325
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,120
How is it?

326
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,601
Ferris wheel is good
Don't you want to ride it?

327
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,321
Ferris wheel is good Oh, really?

328
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
Let's ride a Ferris wheel.

329
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,060
Or let's go to a private room
for two Are you aiming for it?

330
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,040
Are you aiming for it?

331
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Are you aiming for it?

332
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,970
Do you have any plans for a date?

333
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,030
I want to go on a date.

334
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,070
Really!?

335
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,970
A date you want to go on?

336
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,730
A date I admire?

337
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,930
A date you admire.

338
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,510
Or a date you want to go on?

339
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,150
A date you want to go on.

340
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,190
A date you want to go on.

341
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,410
A date?

342
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,411
I see.

343
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,530
I want to go on a date.

344
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,010
I want to go to an amusement park.

345
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,310
I don't have to go out.
I can go on a date at home.

346
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,910
You can relax.

347
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,310
I can watch a movie at
home and cook together.

348
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,890
That's good.

349
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,730
I like that.

350
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:59,490
It's relaxing, isn't it?

351
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,590
Yes.

352
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,480
Is it an amusement park?

353
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Aizawa-kun?

354
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,301
Well... Well...
What should I say?

355
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,290
Well... Well... I'd like to go to a
dream country such as Tokyo or L.A.

356
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,090
Dream country is definitely
something I want to visit.

357
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,170
And the onsen we just went to.

358
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,830
Onsen is definitely a good idea.

359
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:53,800
I wore a yukata at night and
walked around in a capo capo.

360
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,400
Capo capo?

361
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
What?

362
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,940
I walked around in a Zori Zori.

363
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,140
Zori Zori?

364
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Capo capo?

365
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:17,800
I walked around in a capo
capo while wearing a yukata.

366
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,320
Kappo Kappo What is Kappo Kappo?

367
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,560
Walk What is Kappo Kappo?

368
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,220
Go to the footbath together.

369
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,480
Oh, that's good.

370
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,100
There is a footbath in September.

371
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
And at night?

372
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,320
Bathroom.

373
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
And at night?

374
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,040
Bathroom at night.

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,601
Sleep in the bathroom
Sleep in the bathroom?

376
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,920
Sleep in the bathroom No
no no I've never heard of it.

377
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Really?

378
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,700
I'm going to sleep in the bathroom.

379
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,200
You're so excited.

380
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,920
That's good.

381
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,040
I want to have a hot
spring date in the bathroom.

382
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,100
Bathroom?

383
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,800
I want to sleep in the bathroom at night.

384
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,900
I'm going to sleep in the kitchen.

385
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,600
You don't like it?

386
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,840
No, I don't.

387
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,240
I don't like it.

388
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm going to the amusement park.

389
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,160
Can I ride a ride?

390
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:36,040
I love the theme park near Mt.Fuji.

391
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,480
It's the most famous theme park in Japan.

392
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,520
Do you go there often?

393
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:55,840
Have you been there recently?

394
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,776
Oh, you haven't been there recently.

395
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,520
But I need someone who can ride a scooter.

396
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm looking forward to it.

397
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,960
I have to go there with you.

398
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,940
Can you ride a scooter?

399
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,840
I can't.

400
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,460
We can't get on the train, can we?

401
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,960
Wait a minute.

402
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:40,780
I want to get on the train.

403
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,380
We have arrived.

404
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,800
We have arrived.

405
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:00,801
We're here.

406
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,680
Oh, Ferris wheel.

407
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,540
Today is the day to rescue the aquarium.

408
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,360
We couldn't go to the aquarium on the way.

409
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,080
Ferris wheel is working.

410
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,460
Yes, it's moving.

411
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm here.

412
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:38,260
Please be careful not
to hit the side of the bus.

413
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm here.

414
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,500
Thank you for driving.

415
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
You're welcome.

416
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Thank you for telling me.

417
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm here.

418
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm safe.

419
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:00,801
I want to go to Shizuoka.

420
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,040
There is a car about 110 meters away.

421
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,720
110 meters away?

422
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,820
I wonder how many times
bigger than Aizawa-kun.

423
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:27,170
I wonder how many times bigger.

424
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,610
It's Aizawa-kun's bag.

425
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,890
It's a big Ferris wheel.

426
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,150
One more time.

427
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,310
It's a Ferris wheel pose.

428
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,290
It's not cool.

429
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,650
It's not cool.

430
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:59,050
I don't know what to pose.

431
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,190
It's good.

432
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
It's great.

433
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:04,510
It's cute.

434
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,110
It's good.

435
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,750
It's good.

436
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
What?

437
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Selfie?

438
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,140
No.

439
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,920
It's unnatural.

440
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,880
I don't like it.

441
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,380
I don't like it.

442
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
I don't like it.

443
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
You look disgusting.

444
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,060
I don't like glasses.

445
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,080
I don't think so.

446
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,160
I just wear black clothes.

447
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,080
Why do you look at me
with such a dirty look?

448
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,780
I don't like it.

449
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,080
It's a little... It's a
little... It's like that.

450
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,400
It's not a bad thing to
have a hidden agenda.

451
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:27,880
But if you're forced
to do it... It's a real...

452
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,520
It's a serious face.

453
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,480
It's really depressed.

454
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:33,481
He's sleeping.

455
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,220
What if he tries to make
up with you by driving?

456
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,900
He'll get lost.

457
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,900
He'll get lost.

458
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,660
He'll be late.

459
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,260
What?

460
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,480
Why are you advertising?

461
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,481
what are you doing?

462
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,800
but at that time, we had
a lot of fun driving together

463
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:15,580
so I wanted to drive
a bit more so I made a

464
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,480
mistake on the way I don't
know about that though.

465
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,820
2 tickets, 1,600 yen.

466
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,790
Thank you very much.

467
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,791
Here you are.

468
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,250
It's 400 yen and a ticket for two.

469
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Thank you very much.

470
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,370
Have a nice day.

471
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,090
Thank you very much.

472
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,310
This is my first date.

473
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,150
Are you going to drop it?

474
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,530
It's my first time.

475
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:56,531
It's an honor.

476
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,730
It's my first time.

477
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,790
It means I'm stealing.

478
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:10,160
Good morning.

479
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,280
Please wait here.

480
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,990
Excuse me.

481
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,850
Thank you.

482
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,190
It's here.

483
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,530
Finally.

484
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,810
Finally.

485
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,570
It feels faster at night.

486
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,430
Yeah, I think so, too.

487
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,890
From the outside, it
looks like it's moving.

488
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,031
Well, it's a secret room,
but... Wait a minute.

489
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,750
Thank you very much for your ride.

490
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,710
It's like... It's like... It's like...
It's like... It's like... It's like...

491
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,371
It's like... It's
like... It's like...

492
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,671
It's like... I don't
want to go with you!

493
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,390
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

494
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,730
I don't want to!

495
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,550
I don't want to go with you!

496
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:15,390
Well, I mean... I mean... I
mean, it's a beautiful place.

497
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,430
I'm sorry.

498
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:19,190
I'm sorry.

499
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:20,191
You idiot!

500
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,330
I'm sorry.

501
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,010
I've seen that kind of thing.

502
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,530
I've seen that kind of thing.

503
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:34,990
You look at it and you know what it's like.

504
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:35,410
Girls are like that.

505
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,510
I know you're watching.

506
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,790
You know?

507
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,730
I couldn't see it.

508
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,990
I couldn't see the color.

509
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
It's a green.

510
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,710
I'm just using the scanner.

511
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,590
Can I go over there?

512
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,770
Can I go over there?

513
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,930
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,690
It's a green.

515
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:03,150
The sky and the forest are all lined
up, showing off everyone's heart.

516
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,725
Tokyo Bay's horizon line spanning
out before you, the scenery and

517
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:14,410
the blend of the sky, state and
the foliage, can warm your mind.

518
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,437
And this f***ing
f***ing f***ing f***ing

519
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:21,690
f***ing f***ing f**k was
erected as a landmark.

520
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:22,770
What are you doing?

521
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,250
What are you doing?

522
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,270
No.

523
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,650
You're a pervert.

524
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,370
Why do you look that
way Isn't that tilting?

525
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:42,830
It looks a bit tilted
I'm scared It looks a bit

526
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:43,831
tilted I'm scared Tilt,
please You are tilting.

527
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,890
Wow.

528
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,770
The looks.

529
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,730
Pretty There is no such
thing This is beautiful

530
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:54,690
It's a big space walk,
so please enjoy it.

531
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,310
It's okay, I'm here.

532
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,810
I'm a little unreliable.

533
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,670
I can't relax.

534
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,830
Because I'm on the wrong way.

535
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,570
I wonder if there was a manly place.

536
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:19,070
Please enjoy the magnificent
360-degree aerial walk.

537
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,830
I didn't say anything to make him nervous.

538
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,710
He's talking a lot.

539
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,830
I'm fine.

540
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,790
I don't like it.

541
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,630
Look at this.

542
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,390
What is this?

543
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,650
He's trying hard.

544
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,110
He's trying hard to look manly.

545
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:45,860
I want to kiss you.

546
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340

548
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Why?

549
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,480
Why do you want to kiss me?

550
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,720
Anyone is fine.

551
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,800
Anyone is fine as long as you can kiss me.

552
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,640
No, no, no.

553

557
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,806
You don't choose me, do you?

558
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,110
You don't care who I am, do you?

559
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,290
No, I don't.

560
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,410

don't care who I am, do you?

561
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,650
No, I don't.

I'm going to kiss you.

589
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:13,800
You can't do it at all.

590
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,900
You have to hold it up to the top.

591
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
I'm going to kiss you.

592

00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,240
park, but also when
visiting the surrounding area.

596
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,040
I knew you were going to say that!

597
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,820
I knew you were going to say that!

598

601
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,440
What should I do?

602
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:44,700
What should I do?

603
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,620
What should I do?

604
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760

while finishing with the best
time and technique I don't think so.

the highest point, 117 meters.

I can't stand it.

621

Here it comes.

622
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:08,900
I thought he would kiss me
because I couldn't hold it anymore.

623
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
I see.

624
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,900

628
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,340
I don't like it.

629
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm trying not to hit you.

630
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:31,300

646
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,700
One more time?

647
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Are you in a good mood?

648
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Aren't you in a good mood
because you did it once?

649
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
I'm in a good mood.

650
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,190
You look so good.

655
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,130
I'm so shy.

656
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,010
But...

657
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,650
I want to do something.

658
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,270
I'm not a serious person.

659
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,730
I'm not good at it.

660
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,130
What?

661
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:13,950
What?

662
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,090
My voice is coming out.

663
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,610
What?

664
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,750
I don't feel anything.

665
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,230
I don't feel anything.

666
00:42:22,231 --> 00:42:24,370
One, two, three.

667
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,290
Why?

668
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,770
Why do I feel like this?

669
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,150
I don't think I've ever
touched a cat before.

670
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,590
No, you haven't.

671
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,180
It's cute.

672
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,430
You're doing your best.

673
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,420
But that's not the kind of place you're in.

674
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,660
I don't know.

675
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,480
What kind of place?

676
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,970
My body is moving, but
I want you to touch me.

677
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,830
But you said you could endure it.

678
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,250
I can't stand it anymore.

679
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,450
You can't stand it anymore?

680
00:44:25,451 --> 00:44:30,250
I just touched it a little,
but it's already gone.

681
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,950
Isn't it fast?

682
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,103
Did you see the panoramic view
of the Ocean and the magnificent

683
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:59,480
scenery around the park
during the 17-minute aerial walk?

684

Thank you very much
for riding the giant

00:45:21,663 --> 00:45:24,850
Ferris wheel from
Diamond Hill Flowers today.

689
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,150
Sounds fun!

690
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,890
Please sit down at the platform.

691
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,990
Hey, I'm standing up.

692
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,070
Why?

693
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,110
No, this is...

694
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,210
Why?

695
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,410
I'm only touching my nipples.

696
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,930
Why are you standing up?

697
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,090
I don't know.

698
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,250
Isn't it weird?

699
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,210
What do you mean you can't stand it?

700
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,170
I don't like it.

701
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,430
I don't like it.

702
00:45:59,550 --> 00:45:59,810
I'm sorry.

703
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,250
Do you want to eat something?

704
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,050
Yes, I do.

705
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,350
What does that mean?

706
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,390
What does that mean?

707
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,770
I don't know.

708
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,150
In this situation,

709
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,670
I can't date.

710
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,210
I'm so upset.

711
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:22,330
I'm going to eat it before it comes out.

712
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,450
It's almost there.

713
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,710
He's hiding it.

714
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,750
He's so pathetic.

715
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:37,751
I don't think so.

716
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,020
It was fun, wasn't it?

717
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Yeah, it was good.

718
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,240
It went by so fast.

719
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,280
It went by so fast.

720
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,040
It was like 17 or 18 minutes.

721
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,460
18 minutes?

722
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,680
It was like 5 or 6 minutes.

723
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,220
That's what the announcer said.

724
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,380
I didn't hear anything.

725
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,820
I didn't hear anything.

726
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,400
My consciousness...
My consciousness...

727
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,940
My consciousness went to another place.

728
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,000
Did you hear anything?

729
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Did you hear anything?

730
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:25,880
Did you hear anything?

731
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:26,881
I heard nothing.

732
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,780
I heard nothing.

733
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,820
What's wrong?

734
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:36,410
Stop it.

735
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:40,670
I want to eat fish cake.

736
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:42,890
I want to eat fish cake.

737
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,610
I want to eat fish cake.

738
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,630
Let's challenge.

739
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,180
No, no, no.

740
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:01,181
Let's challenge.

00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
Let's challenge.

742
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,090
It's good.

743
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,140
You're a bit over the top.

744
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,470
I can't do it.

745
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:20,671
I'm just trying to do my best.

746
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,570
I know, I know, I know.

747
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,890
Come on.

748
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,226
Hey, don't poke out your nipples.

749
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,370
Don't poke out your nipples.

750
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
That's good, that's good.

751
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,860
That's why it's called Asakusa.

752
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,760
I can't do it.

753
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,840
3, 2, 1.

754
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,760
It's fun.

755
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,160
I can't do it.

756
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:21,340
It was fun.

00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,560
It was fun.

758
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,160
You did your best.

759
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,260
I like this line-up.

760
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,080
You look so happy.

New feature, Aoharu Story.

769
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,460

You're good.

777
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:16,231
I don't think so.

778
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,270
I have a camera.

779
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,370
You look nervous.

780
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,410
I'm fine.

781
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,990
What are you thinking about?

It was sudden.

784
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,950
It was fun.

785
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:38,951

Wait, he's wearing a
wax That's not good.

787
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,590
He's wearing a hat and a wax.

788
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,050

00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,120
It's a really nice room.

793
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,000
Are you going to open it for me?

794
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
You're manly.

795
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,560
Are you showing off?

799
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,880
You're trying to make up
for what you've been told.

800
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,880
I've been told that.

801
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,980
I've been told that.

802
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,540
I made a mistake, but I also
made a mistake in putting it in.

803
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,160
Don't laugh.

804
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,280

I'm serious.

819
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:48,980

825
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:01,940

00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,020
Then it's over.

834
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,720
Satisfied?

835
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:45,160
What do you think?

836
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,600
What do you think?

837
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:49,601
The view is really nice.

838
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,240
The view?

839
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,640
It's nice.

840
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,740
It's getting hot.

841
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,900
What?

842
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,280
It's really nice.

843
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,440
It's not beautiful.

844
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
I'm scared.

845
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,140
I'm scared to stand in the back.

846
00:58:10,141 --> 00:58:12,100
It's a little scary, but it's beautiful.

847
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,920
Look.

848
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,850
What is it?

849
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,260
It's amazing.

850
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,740
Why do you always take it?

851
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,530
You always have it, don't you?

852
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,080
Can you reach it?

853
00:58:46,975 --> 00:58:48,740
You are great.

854
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
You are amazing.

855
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:02,970
You were great.

856
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm sad.

857
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,380
You are sad.

858
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,140
You are sad.

859
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,560
You are sad.

860
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:24,140
It was fun, wasn't it?

861
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,640
Why do you feel it just by doing this?

862
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,100
Because it's easy to feel.

863
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:05,850
What? You haven't changed.

864
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,790
Why do you feel it just by doing this?

865
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,430
You really like it, don't you?

866
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,810
I'm not going to touch you.

867
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,550
He's so nervous.

868
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,450
I want you to touch me.

869
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,670
You want me to touch you already?

870
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,030
Isn't it too early?

871
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,351
You like to be tickled, don't you?

872
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,190
I like to be tickled.

873
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,300
I'll tickle you a lot.

874
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,750
I'm not going to touch you.

875
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:36,751
What?

876
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,650
Oh.

877
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,330
I don't feel anything.

878
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:43,450
You haven't touched it yet.

879
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,515
I think this is enough.

880
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,270
You can feel it without touching it.

881
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,370
This is a good spot.

882
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,390
I don't feel anything.

883
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,981
How do you feel when I touch here?

884
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,820
It feels good when I touch your nails.

885
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:38,875
Like this?

886

Yes.

It's okay.

891
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,910
He's standing up.

892
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,280
What?

893
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
Oh my god.

894

He stands up when I touch his neck.

Yes.

899
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,360

They feel good.

I can feel it again.

912

Oh, you like it.

913
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,220
That's good.

No, I don't want to.

922
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,420
It's painful.

923

It's painful.

I'm a little embarrassed.

1007
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,680
It's stained.

1008
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,520
Uri, Uri, Uri, Uri, Uri, Uri, Uri.

1009
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,380
I'm a little embarrassed.

1010
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:29,461
This is a bit embarrassing.

1011
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,190
You are excited.

1012
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,180
You are naked now.

1013
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,820
How do you feel?

1014
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:40,900
Are you still standing in this situation?

1015
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
You are a pervert.

1016
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:46,855
Am I a pervert?

1017
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,060
Yes.

1018
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,560
What are you doing now?

1019
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:18,260
Please do it properly.

1020
01:11:18,261 --> 01:11:19,261
What are you doing?

1021
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:22,800
Please touch me.

1022
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,310
Please.

1023
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:34,890
Can I touch you?

1024
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,840
You are trembling.

1025
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,240
Oh, I see.

1026
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,640
What?

1027
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,720
I'm not doing anything.

1028
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,320
You're so stubborn.

1029
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,620
You're making that face.

1030
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,640
Oh, no.

1031
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:44,820
What?

1032
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,620
Oh, no.

1033
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:46,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

1034
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,680
It's okay.

1035
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,840
What are you doing?

1036
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:58,600
I want to drink with you.

1037
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:04,780
You really like me, don't you?

1038
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:31,140
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

1039
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,660
Where do you want me to put it?

1040
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,960
It's close to your nose.

1041
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,720
I don't need this.

1042
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,780
I want you to eat it.

1043
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:56,280
It's getting really hard.

1044
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,370
Wow, it's so good.

1045
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:22,640
I want you to lick me.

1046
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,480
That's too fast.

1047
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,040
You like to be teased, don't you?

1048
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,080
But I want you to lick me.

1049
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,380
You want me to lick you?

1050
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,410
Ah.

1051
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,411
Ah.

1052
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:52,830
Why are you frowning?

1053
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,240
Wow.

1054
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,760
Ah.

1055
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,280
It's crazy.

1056
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,760
It's too simple.

1057
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,220
I'm sorry.

1058
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:17,581
I'm sorry, I'm not in a good mood.

1059
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,100
You have a camera.

1060
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,940
Take a picture of me.

1061
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,100
Take a picture of me.

1062
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,400
From this side?

1063
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,600
Yes, from this side.

1064
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,860
I got it.

1065
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,100
That's all I can do.

1066
01:16:48,445 --> 01:16:49,510
Can you take a good picture?

1067
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:49,670
Can you see it?

1068
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,210
Yes, I can.

1069
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,270
What?

1070
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:04,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1071
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,220
What?

1072
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,480
It's too strong.

1073
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,320
It's getting bigger.

1074
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,540
It feels good.

1075
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:13,541
I'm a boy.

1076
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,120
I want to see your boobs.

1077
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,640
My boobs?

1078
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,640
I want to see them.

1079
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,420
Show me.

1080
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,110
Okay.

1081
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,600
You've learned.

1082
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,190
Is this okay?

1083
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:55,730
I want to see you in person.

1084
01:19:00,175 --> 01:19:01,490
You want to see me in person?

1085
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:07,380
It's special.

1086
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,140
Thank you.

1087
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:35,280
You have big boobs, so make them bigger.

1088
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:37,800
Hey.

1089
01:19:37,801 --> 01:19:39,240
It's so big.

1090
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,400
I took it off for you.

1091
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,500
I want you to pinch me.

1092
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,660
You want me to pinch you?

1093
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,240
Yes, I want you to pinch me.

1094
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,260
Like this.

1095
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,910
Wow, it's amazing.

1096
01:20:14,715 --> 01:20:16,930
What do you mean?

1097
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,711
You want me to pinch you, right?

1098
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:41,990
I'm pinching you.

1099
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,250
Does it feel good?

1100
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:01,880
What are you enjoying?

1101
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,100
I'll do it like this.

1102
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:24,310
It's too fast.

1103
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:25,470
It's too fast.

1104
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,610
What's that?

1105
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,220
I'll do it like this.

1106
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:32,510
Wait a minute.

1107
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,170
Are you going to do it?

1108
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:36,290
It's too fast.

1109
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:38,650
Wait a minute.

1110
01:21:38,651 --> 01:21:39,750
What?

1111
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,390
You're the only one who's feeling better.

1112
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,470
What's that?

1113
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,970
Isn't that bad?

1114
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,870
Hey, make yourself feel better next week.

1115
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,190
Yes, I will.

1116
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,950
Come here.

1117
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,390
Come on, hurry up.

1118
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,290
What?

1119
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,450
I'll make myself feel better.

1120
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:07,451
I'm going to do it.

1121
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:17,530
Can you do it?

1122
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,720
It's so beautiful.

1123
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,320
I'm going to do it.

1124
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:38,300
Use your tongue more.

1125
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:53,030
It's not good.

1126
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:02,230
I can't reach it.

1127
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,840
Concentrate on licking.

1128
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,071
I'm going to lick this part too.

1129
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:31,520
Lick that part a lot.

1130
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,310
You're good at licking.

1131
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,700
I can feel your pain.

1132
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:27,701
I love you.

1133
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,040
I love you, too.

1134
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:43,460
I want you to lick my nipples and hug me.

1135
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,520
You want me to do that?

1136
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,840
You're asking too much.

1137
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,760
You're getting carried away.

1138
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:00,761
You like it, don't you?

1139
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
You have to pay for it, don't you?

1140
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:10,860
This one?

1141
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,960
Yes, yes, yes.

1142
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:16,631
You like this one too, don't you?

1143
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,640
Yes.

1144
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:31,380
I like it, I like it.

1145
01:25:31,745 --> 01:25:33,306
Do you like people in the basement too?

1146
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,920
Yes, I like it.

1147
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:40,620
It's a baby's play.

1148
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,300
Is it a baby's play?

1149
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:42,940
Yeah.

1150
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,000
It feels good to touch it.

1151
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:46,400
Yeah, it feels good.

1152
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:48,330
Let's lick it.

1153
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:54,090
He said, Babu.

1154
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:54,890
Babu.

1155
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:56,190
Babu.

1156
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,170
Babu.

1157
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,730
It's pathetic.

1158
01:25:59,130 --> 01:25:59,530
Babu.

1159
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,330
Babu.

1160
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:02,410
Yeah.

1161
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,790
This side too.

1162
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,290
Yeah.

1163
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:05,770
This side too.

1164
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:27,210
Yes.

1165
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,811
Oh, my goodness What?

1166
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,190
Oh my goodness.

1167
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,710
Do you feel good?

1168
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:53,531
Wow, this part is hard Yes.

1169
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,510
He is getting excited
Let's lick your nipples.

1170
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,030
How much do you like your nipples?

1171
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:19,520
How do you feel when you are licked?

1172
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,760
I feel like I'm being pulled.

1173
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,260
Oh, my God.

1174
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,350
Oh, my God.

1175
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,570
Oh, my God.

1176
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,290
You're eating so much.

1177
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,800
I'm going to drink this one.

1178
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:06,340
I can't hold it in.

1179
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,240
You can't hold it in?

1180
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,940
I didn't put it in yet.

1181
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:14,740
I want to put it in.

1182
01:29:14,741 --> 01:29:21,140
You're the best I'm going to sleep Did
you become a man who can't stand it?

1183
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,720
You can stand it with
this costume I can't stand

1184
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:28,280
it I can't stand it anymore
I'm going to sleep.

1185
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:29,980
Okay.

1186
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,050
Oh.

1187
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:39,270
Oh, it's hot.

1188
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:41,630
Oh, it's cool

1189
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:47,430
It's hot It's hot It's hot.

1190
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:50,410
You look like a gentleman.

1191
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,350
Ibuki, it feels so good.

1192
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:45,720
I'm going to rub your back.

1193
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:46,721
That feels good.

1194
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,260
Does it?

1195
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:50,920
I love this feeling.

1196
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,260
I'm going to rub your back.

1197
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,860
I'm going to rub your back.

1198
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,020
That's great.

1199
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:35,660
You can't go yet.

1200
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:54,661
I can't do it.

1201
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,060
Sorry.

1202
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,120
I told you not to do that.

1203
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,180
I'm sorry.

1204
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,690
You can't stand it, can you?

1205
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,370
You can still do it, can't you?

1206
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:00,950
I'm so happy.

1207
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:03,950
Hold on.

1208
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,650
I'll hold on.

1209
01:33:06,651 --> 01:33:07,890
I don't know.

1210
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:34,030
Let me try again.

1211
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:37,450
I haven't done it yet.

1212
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,370
It's hot, isn't it?

1213
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,030
Come here.

1214
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:56,190
Turn around.

1215
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:58,190
Turn around?

1216
01:33:58,220 --> 01:33:59,730
Your stomach is moving.

1217
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:10,650
Does it feel good?

1218
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:11,651
Yes.

1219
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:22,240
You can do it.

1220
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,580
I'm so happy!

1221
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,000
It feels so good.

1222
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:26,050
It feels good, right?

1223
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:40,570
Huh?

1224
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:18,740
You can do it, right?

1225
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:21,920
Yes, I can.

1226
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:22,940
You can do it, right?

1227
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,540
Hurry up.

1228
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:40,860
I'm going to stop.

1229
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:48,530
Say something.

1230
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:02,710
Yes, yes.

1231
01:37:03,895 --> 01:37:08,230
I'm sorry.

1232
01:37:08,231 --> 01:37:11,030
Oh, I see, I see.

1233
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,450
Mizuko, help me.

1234
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,960
Hurry up and move.

1235
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,800
Don't take a break.

1236
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,180
I'm going to sleep.

1237
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:42,870
Are you going to sleep again?

1238
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,430
It's too early.

1239
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:46,010
Don't go.

1240
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,790
Hang in there.

1241
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:52,110
Don't go.

1242
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:57,590
You can do it.

1243
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,220
You can do it.

1244
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:11,360
You are holding it in.

1245
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:34,060
Come here.

1246
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,900
Why do you do it twice?

1247
01:39:40,901 --> 01:39:44,620
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

1248
01:39:44,644 --> 01:39:48,364

1250
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:13,660
What?

1251
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,640
I'm fine.

1252
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,660
You can still do it, right?

1253
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:20,850
Take a break.

1254
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,820
I told you to take a break.

1255
01:40:23,821 --> 01:40:24,821
I told you to do it.

1256
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,700
I'm sorry.

1257
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,660
Stand up quickly.

1258
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,480
I'm sorry.

1259
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:32,720
What?

1260
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:33,900
I'm sorry.

1261
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,660
Toilet.

1262
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:38,620
No.

1263
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:40,260
No, don't do that.

1264
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:50,300
You said you were going to do it.

1265
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:51,900
I'm sorry.

1266
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,460
I was so nervous.

1267
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,100
I told you to be patient.

1268
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,640
I'll be patient.

1269
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:02,580
Can you be patient?

1270
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:05,460
I'll be patient this time.

1271
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,435
I can't trust you.

1272
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:11,660
I can't stand it.

1273
01:41:13,355 --> 01:41:14,400
Can I stand it now?

1274
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,300
I can't do this.

1275
01:41:17,995 --> 01:41:21,340
I can't do this.

1276
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:28,220
I can't stand it.

1277
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,080
Can't I do this?

1278
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:33,020
I can't do this.

1279
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:39,020
I can't feel anything.

1280
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:15,740
What?

1281
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:17,580
You can't?

1282
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,740
You can't?

1283
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,060
Then I'll stop.

1284
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,160
No.

1285
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:21,920
What?

1286
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,320
No.

1287
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:25,140
You can't, can you?

1288
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:33,820
No.

1289
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:43,220
I can't.

1290
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:45,960
I can't speak.

1291
01:42:57,835 --> 01:43:01,720
This time, I'm going to make you do it.

1292
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,880
Really? Can you do it?

1293
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,180
Yes, I can.

1294
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,200
Really?

1295
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:12,520
I'm going to wash my body.

1296
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,720
Are you going to wash your body?

1297
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,360
Yes, I'm going to wash my body.

1298
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,320
I think you can do it.

1299
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:31,760
You're standing up again.

1300
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:35,780
You're too energetic.

1301
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,760
You're too energetic.

1302
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:46,930
You're going to make me feel good, right?

1303
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:47,270
You're going to make me feel good, right?

1304
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:50,710
Please be careful.

1305
01:43:50,711 --> 01:43:50,830
Please be careful.

1306
01:43:50,831 --> 01:43:51,831
Please look at me.

1307
01:43:57,020 --> 01:43:59,150
It's a little dirty.

1308
01:44:02,605 --> 01:44:04,210
Let's wash your hair.

1309
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,090
Do you feel uncomfortable?

1310
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:11,550
I'll wash your hair.

1311
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:17,650
It's not enough.

1312
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:29,800
I can't stand it at all.

1313
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:56,840
You are getting harder and harder.

1314
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:58,800
Shut up.

1315
01:45:00,305 --> 01:45:02,740
You are getting harder and harder.

1316
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,340
It's because I touch you, isn't it?

1317
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:10,900
Touch me more.

1318
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:27,160
It feels good.

1319
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:33,201
I'm so happy I'm so
happy I'm so happy.

1320
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:46,730
I have to stretch my back to reach you.

1321
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,950
My butt too My butt too?

1322
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:58,650
Do you want me to call you?

1323
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:00,731
No Are you okay?

1324
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:01,870
No.

1325
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:11,340
I can't sleep.

1326
01:46:11,341 --> 01:46:14,060
You just want to touch
Aizawa-kun's butt, don't you?

1327
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,660
That may be true.

1328
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:23,000
That's absolutely true.

1329
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:30,630
You're right.

1330
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:33,430
I really can't sleep.

1331
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:37,150
I can't sleep either.

1332
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:54,890
I'm just washing it, but it's a mess.

1333
01:46:56,170 --> 01:46:58,710
Isn't it crazy?

1334
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:01,110
It's too beautiful.

1335
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:02,570
It's crazy.

1336
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:06,810
Hey, I want to wash it.

1337
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:07,930
I'm sorry.

1338
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:10,470
I'll do it from another place.

1339
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:12,525
What?

1340
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:14,090
I'm just shaking it.

1341
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:16,130
I'm just shaking it.

1342
01:47:16,131 --> 01:47:17,550
You have to wash it properly.

1343
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:19,290
I'll wash it properly

1344
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:28,230
You just want to touch it, don't you?

1345
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,840
I'll wash it for you.

1346
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,440
Thank you.

1347
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:38,890
Why are you so excited?

1348
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:40,570
Is that so?

1349
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:42,630
I don't feel like it.

1350
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:44,030
You don't feel like it?

1351
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:44,790
I don't feel like it.

1352
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:46,090
You're a pervert.

1353
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:47,230
Yes, I am.

1354
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:56,730
I don't know.

1355
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:09,850
It's hard, isn't it?

1356
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:12,670
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

1357
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:30,100
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

1358
01:49:53,811 --> 01:49:55,790
I'm sorry.

1359
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:57,470
I'm sorry.

1360
01:49:57,471 --> 01:49:57,910
What's wrong?

1361
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:59,310
I'm sleepy.

1362
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:00,970
I'm sorry.

1363
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:32,310
I'm sorry.

1364

01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:39,250
I'm sorry.

1367
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:40,270
I'm sorry.

1368
01:50:41,545 --> 01:50:44,930
I don't think I can do it.

1369
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:45,931
What do you think?

1370
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:47,470
I don't know.

1371
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:49,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

1372
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,390

I don't know what you're talking about.

1374
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:54,226
I don't know what you're talking about.

1375
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

1376
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:00,890

1377
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,201
I don't know what you're talking about.

1378
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,340
What are you doing?

1379
01:51:14,341 --> 01:51:15,341
Oh, I'm sorry.

1380
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,960
What's wrong?

1381
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,520
I'm telling you to go ahead.

1382
01:51:19,521 --> 01:51:20,580
I'll do it again.

1383
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:29,260
No, no, no.

1384
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,060
I'm too happy.

1385
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:33,100
It's okay.

1386
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:37,520
I'll do it again.

1387
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,660
Let's do it again.

1388
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,460
You're so cute.

1389
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,220
I'm going to wash my hands.

1390
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,780
I'm going to wash my hands.

1391
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,040

01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:24,620
I'm going to wash my hands.

1394
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,240
It's been a long time since I've
had a bath, so I'm getting used to it.

1395
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:46,420
It's been a long time since I've
had a bath, so I'm getting used to it.

01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:37,830
It's been a long time since I've
had a bath, so I'm getting used to it.

1399
01:53:44,831 --> 01:53:45,831
What is this?

1400
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:52,100
It's like a bath without a shower.

1401
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,840
It's like a bath without a shower.

1402
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,260
I've been to the bathroom twice.

1403
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:57,856
I've been to the bathroom twice.

1404
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,720
I want to recover.

1405
01:53:59,721 --> 01:54:00,721
I want to recover.

1406
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,040
Do you still need to recover?

1407
01:54:03,041 --> 01:54:04,201
Do you still need to recover?

1408

Yes, I need to recover.

1410
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:12,000
Can you hold it in?

1411
01:54:12,001 --> 01:54:13,001
Can you hold it in?

1412
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,780
Can you hold it in?

1413
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:23,260
I'm going to take a bath now
OK Can I put this on your back?

1414
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,280
Yes.

1415
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:29,580
What?

1416
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,200
Let me see.

1417
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,720
Oh.

1418
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:38,560
What?

1419
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,420
Wait a second OK.

1420
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:47,020
Wow What?

1421
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:52,220
Why are you making such a pathetic voice?

1422
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:55,140
Because...

1423
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:09,030
You just made a lot of noises.

1424
01:55:12,735 --> 01:55:14,220
You can't help it anymore, can you?

1425
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:15,740
I can't help it.

1426
01:55:16,675 --> 01:55:22,550
What's wrong?

1427
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:43,760
What's wrong with you?

1428
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:50,540
What's wrong with you?

1429
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:09,380
Please don't laugh at me.

1430
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,280
I feel so bad that I can't help laughing.

1431
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:13,920
What is this?

1432
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:25,360
You are so strict.

1433
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,040
What do you mean by strict?

1434
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:31,260
Are you making fun of me?

1435
01:56:35,535 --> 01:56:36,535
You are so strict.

1436
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:41,180
How is it?

1437
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:42,520
Ah, it's coming.

1438
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:44,180
Huh?

1439
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:47,220
It's coming.

1440
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:50,450
What?

1441
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,920
Why did you say that so quickly?

1442
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:57,460
Because it's too good.

1443
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,180
Really.

1444
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:03,300
It's too good I knew it

1445
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:08,900
Since we're on camera,
take more More?

1446
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:10,860
You can't take it off.

Stand up.

1448
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:14,840
You can't take it off
in your current state.

1449
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:16,840
Stand up.

1450
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,840
You're not happy.

1451
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,820
You're happy, aren't you?

1452
01:57:25,045 --> 01:57:26,160
Stand up.

Because I'm licked by my own penis?

1460
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:32,870
I like your face when you're sucking it in.

02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:06,981
It's very beautiful,
but... Okay.

1508
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,940
I'm prettier, right?

1509
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:09,920
Yes.

1510
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:10,940
I know. Okay.

1511
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,920
You're doing your best.

1512
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:15,380
You're cute.

1513
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:17,980
What?

1514
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,320
I'm doing my best.

1515
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:21,480
Really?

1516
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:21,860
Yes.

1517
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:22,861
You're really pretty.

1518
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,740
Why are you appealing
with your small voice?

1519
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:29,660
You're cute.

1520
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:53,930
After dinner, I prepared a beer.

1521
02:03:56,230 --> 02:03:57,230
You are good.

1522
02:03:58,030 --> 02:03:59,350
Did you really prepare it?

1523
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:01,170
Yes, I did.

1524
02:04:01,171 --> 02:04:02,211
Did you really prepare it?

1525
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:03,690
Yes, I did.

1526
02:04:04,750 --> 02:04:05,750
You are good.

1527
02:04:05,850 --> 02:04:06,850
You are good.

1528
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:08,910
You are good.

1529
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:13,130
I made a mistake at the beginning.

1530
02:04:13,131 --> 02:04:14,710
I made a mistake. I'm going to be late.

1531
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:16,610
Let's have a toast.

1532
02:04:21,370 --> 02:04:22,670
Beer is the best.

1533
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:25,110
Do you drink alcohol?

1534
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:31,530
Me? I get drunk easily, but
it takes a long time to drink.

1535
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:34,530
I drink at night.

1536
02:04:35,370 --> 02:04:36,370
Can you do it?

1537
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:39,450
Well...

1538
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:41,110
I'll do my best.

1539
02:04:41,410 --> 02:04:42,490
I'll do my best.

1540
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,490
You're so energetic.

1541
02:04:45,410 --> 02:04:46,630
You'd better calm down.

1542
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:48,750
Cheers!

1543
02:04:58,580 --> 02:05:00,560
It's delicious.

1544
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,680
It's delicious.

1545
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:03,900
Is it delicious?

1546
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:05,860
What?

1547
02:05:05,861 --> 02:05:06,861
Is it good?

1548
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:08,340
It's good.

1549
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:09,600
Thank you.

1550
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,760
It goes well with beer.

1551
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,300
Does it?

1552
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,840
Does beer and I go well together?

1553
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:17,091
I thought I should praise you for now.

1554
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:18,740
You're too sloppy.

1555
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:20,560
I know.

1556
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,041
It looks delicious. Can I eat it?

1557
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:24,100
Yes, please.

1558
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:27,340
I'll let you eat.

1559
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:28,740
No, it's okay.

1560
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:30,320
I'll let you eat.

1561
02:05:42,190 --> 02:05:44,151
You've been waiting for
a long time, haven't you?

1562
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,216
I've been waiting for a long time.

1563
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:47,960
I was wondering if you would give it to me.

1564
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,500
I was wondering if you would give it to me.

1565
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:54,300
Is it good?

1566
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:55,000
Yes.

1567
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:55,740
Is it good?

1568
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:57,080
It's good.

1569
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,620
You don't eat it.

1570
02:06:04,130 --> 02:06:07,480
I want you to eat it.

1571
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:10,060
I want you to eat it.

1572
02:06:10,061 --> 02:06:11,420
I want you to try it.

1573
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:17,340
Is it good?

1574
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,900
It's really good.

1575
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:22,380
It's good.

1576
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:26,260
Can I drink beer with you?

1577
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:28,420
Can I?

1578
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:30,060
Can I do my best?

1579
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:50,820
What are you laughing at?

1580
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:51,640
What are you laughing at?

1581
02:06:52,145 --> 02:06:54,340
It was good.

1582
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:55,920
Yeah, it was good.

1583
02:06:58,635 --> 02:07:00,220
I'll do it for you, too.

1584
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:16,470
You're spilling too much. Drink it up.

1585
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:19,720
I'm not going to.

1586
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,620
This is the most delicious
pudding I've ever had in my life.

1587
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:36,820
Isn't it too bad to praise?

1588
02:07:41,315 --> 02:07:43,820
There's a better way to praise.

1589
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,000
It's a penalty game.

1590
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:51,480
Penalty game?

1591
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:52,100
Penalty game.

1592
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:52,680
This?

1593
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:53,880
What do you think?

1594
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:55,800
What is it?

1595
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,880
What is it?

1596
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:04,120
It's cold, isn't it?

1597
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,160
But you like nipples, so it's okay.

1598
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:08,500
Wait a minute.

1599
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:11,320
My nose is open.

1600
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:13,700
But you like nipples, don't you?

1601
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:15,260
It's embarrassing.

1602
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:16,160
It's open.

1603
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:17,780
Is it embarrassing?

1604
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:19,280
It's open.

1605
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:25,600
I don't know.

1606
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:30,440
I'm doing my best.

1607
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:35,220
I'm so embarrassed.

1608
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:38,080
I'm so embarrassed.

1609
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:39,600
I'm so embarrassed.

1610
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:40,800
I'm so embarrassed.

1611
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:40,940
I'm so embarrassed.

1612
02:08:40,941 --> 02:08:41,941
Aren't you happy?

1613
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:44,580
Maybe it's not a punishment.

1614
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,920
Is it a reward?

1615
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:51,060
Why do you like this?

1616
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:55,430
Do you feel good?

1617
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,920
Do you feel good?

1618
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,600
Do you like me?

1619
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:17,920
Look at this.

1620
02:09:17,921 --> 02:09:18,921
It's all wet.

1621
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,780
It's embarrassing.

1622
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:26,800
But you like me.

1623
02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:30,220
You're a pervert.

1624
02:09:30,221 --> 02:09:31,221
You're so cute.

1625
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:36,440
I can tell you're standing up.

1626
02:09:46,130 --> 02:09:48,131
You stand up right away
when I touch your nipples.

1627
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:10,850
What?

1628
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:12,870
You can't see me?

1629
02:10:17,190 --> 02:10:18,230
Oh, it's painful.

1630
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,250
Oh, it's amazing.

1631
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:24,750
Oh, it's from behind.

1632
02:10:28,915 --> 02:10:30,260
It's not from behind.

1633
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:36,060
It smells good.

1634
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,580
It's like this.

1635
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:45,900
Yes.

1636
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:53,720
I just touched it from
above, but why is it like this?

1637
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:56,100
Oh, great.

1638
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:01,130
Your lower back is moving.

1639
02:11:16,175 --> 02:11:18,580
You're making a really embarrassing face.

1640
02:11:33,850 --> 02:11:40,570
You like this one, don't you?

1641
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:41,710
I like this one.

1642
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:47,260
You are moving around.

1643
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:49,160
Can I pet you?

1644
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:50,100
Wait a minute.

1645
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:51,520
His legs are moving.

1646
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:53,600
He can't move.

1647
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:55,460
He is a grown-up.

1648
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:08,690
You are so mischievous.

1649
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:15,910
I'm so embarrassed.

1650
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:18,550
You are embarrassed?

1651
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:20,770
But you are excited, aren't you?

1652
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:26,310
You are apologizing.

1653
02:12:26,690 --> 02:12:27,050
You are apologizing.

1654
02:12:27,051 --> 02:12:29,090
It's rare to see you in such a cool outfit.

1655
02:12:31,750 --> 02:12:33,830
Gin-chan, you're moving a lot.

1656
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,090
Tanuki-chan.

1657
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:59,080
You like this so much.

1658
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:02,360
You're so cute.

1659
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:04,700
I feel uncomfortable.

1660
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:05,760
Why?

1661
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:08,440
I feel uncomfortable.

1662
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:10,380
I feel uncomfortable.

1663
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:12,980
Look at me.

1664
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:18,380
I'll show you this.

1665
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:19,920
What?

1666
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:22,611
What do you think is underneath this?

1667
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:23,260
What?

1668
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,240
I don't know.

1669
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:29,360
I don't know. I'm just having fun.

1670
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:31,020
I'm shocked.

1671
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,600
I want to see it.

1672
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:33,180
You want to see it?

1673
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:34,470
Please show it to me.

1674
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:39,720
I want you to kiss me.

1675
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:57,900
That's amazing. You can do that?

1676
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:02,240
I'm going to do it.

1677
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:03,480
What are you wearing?

1678
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,601
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

1679
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,260
Ta-da!

1680
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:10,280
Wow.

1681
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:12,340
Show me more reaction.

1682
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:14,200
It's really good.

1683
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:16,120
It's transparent.

1684
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:19,220
Do you like it?

1685
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:21,360
I came here for you.

1686
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:22,540
For me?

1687
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:23,020
Yes.

1688
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:24,440
I'm so happy.

1689
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:25,880
Be happy.

1690
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:27,020
I'm so excited.

1691
02:14:27,021 --> 02:14:28,581
I don't know what you're talking about.

1692
02:14:31,915 --> 02:14:35,360
I don't know if it's a good
idea to touch you directly.

1693
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:42,880
I don't know if it's a good idea to
touch you from the back of your head.

1694
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:49,460
I don't know if I should say that.

1695
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:18,310
You are so big.

1696
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:34,640
I'm sick of your belly.

1697
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:03,530
I can't touch you.

1698
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:39,160
I can't see you.

1699
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:01,980
You are so small.

1700
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,020
Well...

1701
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,460
I have no idea.

1702
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:18,620
Really?

1703
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:34,600
Well, I am standing now.

1704
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:37,940
Oh, my voice.

1705
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,160
Yes.

1706
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:43,100
How many times I've said it?

1707
02:17:45,740 --> 02:17:46,880
I don't know what I've said.

1708
02:18:03,210 --> 02:18:04,210
What?

1709
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:07,570
Do you want to drink it?

1710
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:09,090
Yes.

1711
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:23,390
You are unusually active.

1712
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:25,650
I'll make you feel better next time.

1713
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:28,850
I see.

1714
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:42,680
It feels good there.

1715
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:43,440
Really?

1716
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:44,900
Yes.

1717
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:47,780
Give me that.

1718
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:49,180
Yes.

1719
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:06,610
What?

1720
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:15,830
It's embarrassing Why are
you making me embarrassed?

1721
02:19:20,865 --> 02:19:29,430
If you want to feel good, lick me

1722
02:19:29,630 --> 02:19:32,190
Come here Lie down.

1723
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:37,790
Look at this.

1724
02:19:37,791 --> 02:19:38,791
Look at this.

1725
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:41,730
Look at this.

1726
02:19:41,805 --> 02:19:43,130
Look at this.

1727
02:19:43,131 --> 02:19:44,131
Look at this.

1728
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:52,830
Look at me and lick me.

1729
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:14,800
Why do you look so happy?

1730
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,400
Are you happy?

1731
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:18,400
Yes, I am.

1732
02:20:18,625 --> 02:20:19,625
Can you drink more?

1733
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:22,300
You can drink more, can't you?

1734
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:23,740
Sorry, it's too sweet.

1735
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,100
It's nice to be able to drink a lot.

1736
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:49,310
I'm annoyed that you
leave me to do something.

1737
02:20:49,311 --> 02:20:51,090
It's annoying, isn't it?

1738
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:52,310
Does it feel good?

1739
02:20:52,430 --> 02:20:53,430
It feels good.

1740
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:56,630
It feels good, but it's annoying.

1741
02:20:59,090 --> 02:21:00,790
I think Yare-zan is better.

1742
02:21:03,955 --> 02:21:05,350
It's pathetic, isn't it?

1743
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:09,100
Hey, look.

1744
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:24,360
It's all messed up.

1745
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:31,530
It's not my fault. Did you do that?

1746
02:21:31,531 --> 02:21:31,670
Did you put it on?

1747
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:34,110
Yes, I did.

1748
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:40,070
I love this.

1749
02:21:57,071 --> 02:21:58,071
It's good, isn't it?

1750
02:22:03,730 --> 02:22:07,730
I'm embarrassed because I'm on the sofa.

1751
02:22:08,050 --> 02:22:08,590
Here?

1752
02:22:08,950 --> 02:22:09,950
Yes.

1753
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:11,930
It's embarrassing.

1754
02:22:12,785 --> 02:22:15,530
I'm excited because it's embarrassing.

1755
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:30,000
It's good that I can eat it in one day.

1756
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:37,400
Uh-huh.

1757
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:39,580
Ah, okay.

1758
02:22:39,581 --> 02:22:40,581
Uh-huh.

1759
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:48,120
Uh-huh.

1760
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,440
I don't understand.

1761
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:53,740
What?

1762
02:22:54,750 --> 02:22:55,520
I didn't get it.

1763
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:56,600
I don't understand.

1764
02:22:56,601 --> 02:22:57,520
No, I understood.

1765
02:22:57,521 --> 02:22:58,521
No, I don't think so.

1766
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:03,680
I want to be four times taller than you.

1767
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:06,120
Four times taller?

1768
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:08,320
Yes, four times taller than you.

1769
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:09,760
I can do it.

1770
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:12,280
I'm a little embarrassed.

1771
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:13,540
Why?

1772
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:16,290
I'm 22 years old.

1773
02:23:21,140 --> 02:23:22,440
You look like a grown-up.

1774
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:28,520
What?

1775
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:29,770
What?

1776
02:23:30,570 --> 02:23:31,570
What?

1777
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:33,760
What?

1778
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:38,000
He's lying down, and I'm
touching his neck from behind.

1779
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:41,760
It's hard to imagine, isn't it?

1780
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:43,560
It's hard, but I'm excited.

1781
02:23:45,055 --> 02:23:46,055
You're excited?

1782
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:47,480
I'm excited.

1783
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:50,520
You're cute.

1784
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:53,350
What?

1785
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:54,400
What?

1786
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:01,780
You are too excited.

1787
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:10,400
Come here.

1788
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:12,840
Come here.

1789
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:14,390
Put your leg up.

1790
02:24:15,130 --> 02:24:16,370
I'll make you more embarrassed.

1791
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:22,660
Look.

1792
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:23,700
No, no.

1793
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:28,160
Look at this.

1794
02:24:29,930 --> 02:24:31,540
My hips are round.

1795
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:33,040
Yeah, they are.

1796
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:34,520
It's embarrassing.

1797
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:36,340
This is the most embarrassing outfit.

1798
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:37,920
Are you excited?

1799
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:49,400
It's embarrassing.

1800
02:24:51,770 --> 02:24:53,740
I'm so embarrassed.

1801
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:54,960
I'm so embarrassed.

1802
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:58,840
I can't see anything.

1803
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:02,060
Are you excited?

1804
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:04,560
You're shaking a lot.

1805
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:16,540
I'm so embarrassed.

1806
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:21,020
I'm so embarrassed.

1807
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:24,940
I'm so embarrassed.

1808
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:26,900
I'm so embarrassed.

1809
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:28,760
You're excited, aren't you?

1810
02:25:31,790 --> 02:25:32,880
You're so excited.

1811
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:35,290
I'm so embarrassed.

1812
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:41,700
Are you embarrassed?

1813
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:43,080
Yes.

1814
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:46,880
You're so pathetic.

1815
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:50,580
Do you want to turn off the light?

1816
02:25:51,170 --> 02:25:52,650
Then you won't be embarrassed, right?

1817
02:25:52,970 --> 02:25:54,940
I'll turn off the light and make it darker.

1818
02:25:59,090 --> 02:26:01,040
You're cute.

1819
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:03,520
Wait a minute.

1820
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:11,760
You're not embarrassed, are you?

1821
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:14,180
It's getting dark.

1822
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:18,100
Sleep here.

1823
02:26:19,430 --> 02:26:20,430
I'll turn off the light.

1824
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,180
Good morning.

1825
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:24,920
I'm going to take a nap.

1826
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,880
He is doing his best.

1827
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:33,440
He is doing his best.

1828
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:35,240
I'm embarrassed.

1829
02:26:42,530 --> 02:26:45,080
Are you going to take a video of me?

1830
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:46,740
You are good at it.

1831
02:26:47,905 --> 02:26:48,900
This is the floor.

1832
02:26:48,901 --> 02:26:52,640
Be careful of your head.

1833
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:03,750
Is it recording?

1834
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:17,260
I'll give you a lot of my saliva.

1835
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:25,360
What are you doing?

1836
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:28,120
Does it feel good?

1837
02:27:59,730 --> 02:28:00,860
You are too scared.

1838
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:05,020
Does it feel good?

1839
02:28:25,990 --> 02:28:26,990
Do you feel good?

1840
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,940
I feel great.

1841
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:36,900
Where are you licking now?

1842
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:44,830
What is it?

1843
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:47,650
Chinchin's...

1844
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:49,730
Chinchin's collarbone.

1845
02:28:51,810 --> 02:28:53,390
You don't like it.

1846
02:28:54,410 --> 02:28:55,950
Are you embarrassed?

1847
02:29:06,035 --> 02:29:07,980
I like rabbit ears.

1848
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:11,700
I want you to touch my nipples.

1849
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:16,880
You want me to touch your nipples?

1850
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:20,120
You are greedy.

1851
02:29:23,490 --> 02:29:27,020
Is it good?

1852
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:40,020
Which do you feel
better, chin-chin or neck?

1853
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:43,940
Both feel good, but chin-chin.

1854
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:47,700
Chin-chin feels good.

1855
02:29:48,970 --> 02:29:50,280
Why is your face so swollen?

1856
02:29:54,290 --> 02:29:55,290
I can't do it.

1857
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,080
You can't do it?

1858
02:30:02,310 --> 02:30:03,310
What do you want to do?

1859
02:30:18,850 --> 02:30:24,720
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

1860
02:30:25,855 --> 02:30:27,640
No, I don't want to.

1861
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:30,020
Be patient.

1862
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:46,830
You always say you'll be
patient, but you say it quickly.

1863
02:30:49,150 --> 02:30:52,310
Don't go before I'm satisfied.

1864
02:30:55,610 --> 02:30:56,610
Really?

1865
02:31:01,550 --> 02:31:03,100
I'll make you feel better.

1866
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:05,960
Can I put this in?

1867
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,780
Chinchin is very energetic.

1868
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:21,880
I'll put it in.

1869
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:23,650
I'll put it in.

1870
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:25,240
Take the right place to put it in.

1871
02:31:56,470 --> 02:31:58,470
I feel sick.

1872
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:13,890
I think I'm going to die.

1873
02:32:56,100 --> 02:33:01,060
I feel sick when I'm on the toilet.

1874
02:33:01,061 --> 02:33:06,621
I don't want you to go to the bathroom.

1875
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:16,400
What's wrong?

1876
02:34:16,830 --> 02:34:17,390
What's wrong?

1877
02:34:17,790 --> 02:34:18,790
What's wrong?

1878
02:34:18,990 --> 02:34:20,030
You might be sick.

1879
02:34:36,630 --> 02:34:38,430
Are you sick?

1880
02:34:38,825 --> 02:34:39,825
I'm a little sick.

1881
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:49,170
I'm going to put it on the back this time.

1882
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:53,690
It's easier to see if it's in there, right?

1883
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:03,420
It feels good.

1884
02:36:13,335 --> 02:36:16,020
It feels so good.

1885
02:36:36,485 --> 02:36:37,660
Come here.

1886
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:57,790
It feels so good.

1887
02:37:07,370 --> 02:37:09,190
I'm going to touch your neck.

1888
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:15,010
I'm going to touch your neck.

1889
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:47,110
Ouch!

1890
02:38:16,685 --> 02:38:18,940
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1891
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:27,490
I'm going.

1892
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:43,890
I'm going.

1893
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:47,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1894
02:38:47,510 --> 02:38:48,510
I'm going.

1895
02:39:04,770 --> 02:39:06,900
Oh, no.

1896
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:09,840
Did you go again?

1897
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:16,880
You're so energetic.

1898
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:26,440
You can still go, right?

1899
02:39:30,650 --> 02:39:35,540
You're energetic when I touch you.

1900
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:39,740
I don't want to do it.

1901
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:44,460
Whose fault do you think it is?

1902
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,280
It hurts.

1903
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:09,900
Oh, no.

1904
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:11,380
I'm just a human.

1905
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:14,440
Why do I have to do this?

1906
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:29,220
Oh, no.

1907
02:40:45,080 --> 02:40:48,480
Come on, move a bit more.

1908
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,520
I can't do it anymore.

1909
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:14,360
More, more.

1910
02:41:20,940 --> 02:41:23,740
There's a lot more over there.

1911
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:45,130
You're out of breath.

1912
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:51,650
I'll move it for you.

1913
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:04,250
It's really ticklish.

1914
02:42:10,010 --> 02:42:13,030
It feels good.

1915
02:42:14,610 --> 02:42:15,610
It feels good.

1916
02:42:18,290 --> 02:42:19,810
It's ticklish.

1917
02:42:21,370 --> 02:42:23,330
It feels good.

1918
02:42:23,331 --> 02:42:24,331
What is it?

1919
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:34,010
Isn't it too early?

1920
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:41,330
I just told you Please
be patient No, no.

1921
02:42:51,430 --> 02:42:52,430
What?

1922
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:55,590
What's wrong?

1923
02:42:59,330 --> 02:43:00,490
What's wrong?

1924
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:02,450
What?

1925
02:43:03,010 --> 02:43:04,010
What?

1926
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:12,010
It feels so good.

1927
02:43:12,270 --> 02:43:16,460
It feels so good.

1928
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:17,920
It feels so good.

1929
02:43:17,921 --> 02:43:18,921
Kaki-chan.

1930
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:19,300
What?

1931
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:19,960
Kaki-chan.

1932
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:21,100
Again?

1933
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:26,260
I can't stand it.

1934
02:43:26,261 --> 02:43:27,980
I'm sorry.

1935
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:39,680
I can't stand it anymore.

1936
02:43:39,681 --> 02:43:41,100
I can't do it anymore.

1937
02:43:56,660 --> 02:44:04,910
I went too far.

1938
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:08,930
That was too fast.

1939
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:14,690
You can't do it anymore?

1940
02:44:18,070 --> 02:44:19,990
You can still do it, right?

1941
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:23,110
I'm fixing it.

1942
02:44:24,310 --> 02:44:25,310
See?

1943
02:44:29,490 --> 02:44:30,490
See?

1944
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:35,530
What?

1945
02:44:35,531 --> 02:44:37,490
Oh no.

1946
02:44:38,570 --> 02:44:39,830
Oh no.

1947
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:40,490
Oh no.

1948
02:44:40,910 --> 02:44:42,210
It's okay.

1949
02:44:43,330 --> 02:44:45,090
Don't pretend to be impossible.

1950
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:48,370
Don't move.

1951
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:51,100
It's okay.

1952
02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:56,090
Don't move.

1953
02:44:57,650 --> 02:44:59,330
It's okay.

1954
02:44:59,430 --> 02:45:00,430
It's okay.

1955
02:45:05,530 --> 02:45:07,490
You're stammering a lot.

1956
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:14,870
I told you to be patient.

1957
02:45:20,015 --> 02:45:21,790
You're a man, aren't you?

1958
02:45:22,810 --> 02:45:26,830
I'm at my limit.

1959
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:31,350
You're not at your limit.

1960
02:45:31,351 --> 02:45:32,490
I told you it's not easy.

1961
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:35,790
It's easy, isn't it?

1962
02:45:35,930 --> 02:45:40,950
I told you to be patient.

1963
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:53,950
Did you go again?

1964
02:45:53,951 --> 02:45:54,951
Did you really do it?

1965
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:56,810
Wow.

1966
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:01,130
But you can still do it, right?

1967
02:46:02,375 --> 02:46:03,375
I can't do it.

1968
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:05,250
You can do it.

1969
02:46:07,110 --> 02:46:08,310
One more time.

1970
02:46:10,270 --> 02:46:11,270
Come on.

1971
02:46:14,270 --> 02:46:16,790
You are a lively fish.

1972
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:19,250
Go, go, go.

1973
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:27,160
What do you want to eat?

1974
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:29,180
I want to eat ice cream.

1975
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:32,560
It's too short.

1976
02:46:36,780 --> 02:46:38,080
Let's eat ice cream.

1977
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,260
Do you usually eat ice cream?

1978
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:42,640
I eat a lot.

1979
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:45,220
There is an ice cream store in front of us.

1980
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:46,380
It's interesting.

1981
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:47,840
What should we eat?

1982
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:49,360
It looks delicious.

1983
02:46:49,361 --> 02:46:50,680
It's good, isn't it?

1984
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:52,160
It's good, isn't it?

1985
02:46:52,161 --> 02:46:53,200
Yeah, it's good.

1986
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:55,080
It's good.

1987
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:11,000
How many times have you
been to a convenience store?

1988
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:16,400
It's difficult, but...

1989
02:47:17,420 --> 02:47:18,020
Difficult?

1990
02:47:18,420 --> 02:47:20,141
It's difficult, but... Cute?

1991
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:21,260
What's that?

1992
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:22,800
What?

1993
02:47:22,980 --> 02:47:24,280
You're teasing me.

1994
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:26,020
Difficult?

1995
02:47:35,850 --> 02:47:39,250
There's a lot of chopsticks in there.

1996
02:47:42,730 --> 02:47:45,810
The pie crust is really good.

1997
02:47:50,990 --> 02:47:54,750
The pie crust is really good.

1998
02:47:55,710 --> 02:47:57,010
You like it, don't you?

1999
02:47:57,230 --> 02:47:58,450
Yes, I do.

2000
02:47:58,890 --> 02:47:59,570
Right?

2001
02:47:59,571 --> 02:48:01,850
It's choco-choco, isn't it?

2002
02:48:03,170 --> 02:48:03,930
It's good, isn't it?

2003
02:48:03,950 --> 02:48:04,950
Choco-choco?

2004
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:05,530
It's good, isn't it?

2005
02:48:05,730 --> 02:48:06,230
It's good, isn't it?

2006
02:48:06,290 --> 02:48:06,930
You like choco, don't you?

2007
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:07,950
I like choco.

2008
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:09,610
Which one do you like better, me or him?

2009
02:48:11,170 --> 02:48:13,870
You don't have to answer that question.

2010
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:16,270
You don't answer it properly.

2011
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:19,790
Mr. Ibuki.

2012
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:22,190
Well done.

2013
02:48:29,570 --> 02:48:31,930
I'm going to buy it.

2014
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:38,450
Thank you.

2015
02:48:39,890 --> 02:48:41,970
The night view is beautiful
at this time of the day.

2016
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:49,090
Let's go to see it.

2017
02:48:49,570 --> 02:48:50,570
Sounds good.

2018
02:48:51,390 --> 02:48:52,390
Let's go to the back.

2019
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:52,970
Sounds good.

2020
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:54,610
There are a lot of people.

2021
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:56,310
A lot of people.

2022
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:57,210
There are a lot of people.

2023
02:48:57,211 --> 02:48:57,790
Bahe.

2024
02:48:58,170 --> 02:48:59,170
It's bahe, isn't it?

2025
02:48:59,290 --> 02:48:59,650
Bahe.

2026
02:49:00,050 --> 02:49:01,050
It's bahe.

2027
02:49:02,450 --> 02:49:09,110
Oh, no. I'm embarrassed.

2028
02:49:10,670 --> 02:49:11,670
I'm happy.

2029
02:49:12,290 --> 02:49:13,290
I'm happy.

2030
02:49:13,970 --> 02:49:14,530
I'm happy.

2031
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:15,690
I'm happy.

2032
02:49:16,470 --> 02:49:18,210
I'm happy to see you so happy.

2033
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:23,350
I'm happy.

2034
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:25,070
I'm happy.

2035
02:49:25,071 --> 02:49:26,071
I'm happy.

2036
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:37,130
It's like a love reality show.

2037
02:49:37,690 --> 02:49:38,690
I'm excited.

2038
02:49:40,630 --> 02:49:41,190
I'm excited.

2039
02:49:41,191 --> 02:49:42,250
It's a love reality show.

2040
02:49:43,250 --> 02:49:44,370
I'm excited.

2041
02:49:45,190 --> 02:49:47,090
I'm excited.

2042
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:51,970
This is... Don't you know this?

2043
02:49:52,070 --> 02:49:53,470
If you do this, it becomes a heart.

2044
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:56,310
It doesn't mean a bat.

2045
02:49:57,130 --> 02:49:57,430
Oh, it doesn't mean a bat.

2046
02:49:57,710 --> 02:49:58,070
It means a heart.

2047
02:49:58,550 --> 02:49:59,690
I don't know what it means.

2048
02:49:59,691 --> 02:50:02,690
One of them is like this.

2049
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:07,790
What's wrong?

2050
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:10,890
Let's eat.

2051
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:17,010
Itadakimasu.

2052
02:50:18,610 --> 02:50:19,610
It's a night view.

2053
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:21,930
It's so beautiful.

2054
02:50:21,931 --> 02:50:26,170
Each of these lights...

2055
02:50:27,910 --> 02:50:28,910
Nothing.

2056
02:50:29,310 --> 02:50:29,690
Nothing.

2057
02:50:30,190 --> 02:50:31,790
Each of them has happiness.

2058
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:33,190
I think so.

2059
02:50:33,290 --> 02:50:36,250
Each of us has happiness.

2060
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:38,910
We have happiness.

2061
02:50:39,130 --> 02:50:39,690
We have happiness.

2062
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:40,870
We are happy.

2063
02:50:41,210 --> 02:50:42,710
Let's give it to them.

2064
02:50:43,370 --> 02:50:44,370
Wait.

2065
02:50:44,470 --> 02:50:45,470
I'll give it to you.

2066
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:45,830
What?

2067
02:50:46,270 --> 02:50:46,670
This?

2068
02:50:46,810 --> 02:50:47,810
I'll give it to you.

2069
02:50:47,910 --> 02:50:48,910
You can eat it.

2070
02:50:49,490 --> 02:50:50,650
No, I'll just have a bite.

2071
02:50:51,930 --> 02:50:52,930
As expected.

2072
02:50:55,250 --> 02:50:56,250
Here you are.

2073
02:51:00,460 --> 02:51:01,460
How is it?

2074
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:02,700
Is it good?

2075
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:04,320
It's good.

2076
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:06,400
I'm going to eat it.

2077
02:51:07,400 --> 02:51:09,420
You don't let me eat it.

2078
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:12,560
Here you are.

2079
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:20,000
It's spread out.

2080
02:51:20,420 --> 02:51:24,610
It's good.

2081
02:51:25,110 --> 02:51:26,710
Is it good?

2082
02:51:26,711 --> 02:51:26,770
How is it?

2083
02:51:27,430 --> 02:51:28,430
It's good.

2084
02:51:30,790 --> 02:51:35,510
Isn't it different from the same
chocolate vanilla ice cream?

2085
02:51:36,670 --> 02:51:37,670
Yes, it is.

2086
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:38,790
It's good.

2087
02:51:41,470 --> 02:51:42,470
Both are good.

2088
02:51:42,810 --> 02:51:44,410
Isn't it too early to be night?

2089
02:51:45,710 --> 02:51:46,710
Is it cold?

2090
02:51:47,070 --> 02:51:48,070
No, it's not cold.

2091
02:51:48,430 --> 02:51:49,730
It's too early to be night.

2092
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:52,090
It's early.

2093
02:51:52,091 --> 02:51:58,890
That means we are getting
closer and closer to the end.

2094
02:52:00,250 --> 02:52:01,310
It's 24 hours.

2095
02:52:01,810 --> 02:52:02,070
That's right.

2096
02:52:02,470 --> 02:52:05,630
It's too soon.

2097
02:52:05,710 --> 02:52:06,710
It's 24 hours.

2098
02:52:06,950 --> 02:52:07,950
It's too soon.

2099
02:52:08,790 --> 02:52:10,830
We will meet in the morning.

2100
02:52:12,070 --> 02:52:14,090
But tomorrow...

2101
02:52:14,830 --> 02:52:15,830
We will be late.

2102
02:52:16,590 --> 02:52:17,590
Right?

2103
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:18,610
That's right.

2104
02:52:18,611 --> 02:52:24,890
We took a plane, got on a car, and
went to the park with the Ferris wheel.

2105
02:52:26,870 --> 02:52:30,630
We took the wrong road
and went to the Ferris wheel.

2106
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:33,450
I want you to forget about that.

2107
02:52:33,750 --> 02:52:36,050
But after that, we went to Bankai.

2108
02:52:38,690 --> 02:52:43,570
I wonder if I made you
go there a few times.

2109
02:52:43,571 --> 02:52:47,690
How many times did you go there?

2110
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:51,130
How many times did I go there?

2111
02:52:52,510 --> 02:52:54,390
How many times did I go there?

2112
02:52:55,130 --> 02:52:56,090
How many times did you go there?

2113
02:52:56,091 --> 02:52:56,110
Five?

2114
02:52:56,370 --> 02:52:57,370
Six?

2115
02:52:57,410 --> 02:52:58,410
Five.

2116
02:52:58,470 --> 02:52:59,470
Six times.

2117
02:53:00,130 --> 02:53:01,390
I went there about six times.

2118
02:53:02,110 --> 02:53:03,690
It's crazy, isn't it?

2119
02:53:05,390 --> 02:53:08,730
How many times did you go there?

2120
02:53:09,570 --> 02:53:11,610
I went there about twice.

2121
02:53:11,611 --> 02:53:13,251
I think it's about 1 third of the amount.

2122
02:53:14,050 --> 02:53:15,450
I'm drinking 1 third of the amount.

2123
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:17,330
What?

2124
02:53:17,360 --> 02:53:18,360
Isn't it too much?

2125
02:53:19,770 --> 02:53:20,770
Hey.

2126
02:53:21,650 --> 02:53:22,650
Hey.

2127
02:53:24,050 --> 02:53:26,710
I can't make up for it with a kiss.

2128
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:41,260
Sweet and sour.

2129
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:43,260
Sweet and sour.

2130
02:53:43,740 --> 02:53:44,740
Sweet and sour.

2131
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:48,440
It's good.

2132
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:53,700
Let's see the other side.

2133
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:57,200
It's warm.

2134
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:00,340
I'll warm it up for you.

2135
02:54:02,300 --> 02:54:04,180
Will you warm it up for me?

2136
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:06,160
Yes, I will.

2137
02:54:55,400 --> 02:55:03,930
I was about to fall asleep.

2138
02:55:04,450 --> 02:55:09,640
I'm late.

2139
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:18,150
It's 4 o'clock and we
are not taking a break.

2140
02:55:28,410 --> 02:55:30,690
What should I do?

2141
02:55:39,970 --> 02:55:43,650
I can't do it anymore.

2142
02:56:41,050 --> 02:56:42,540
I feel like I'm going to die.

2143
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:43,500
Really?

2144
02:56:43,980 --> 02:56:44,980
Yeah.

2145
02:57:07,660 --> 02:57:11,100
Let's take a break on the bed.

2146
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:12,600
Okay.

2147
03:00:32,150 --> 03:00:33,330
What's wrong?

2148
03:00:37,470 --> 03:00:38,470
What are you doing?

2149
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:40,150
What?

2150
03:00:41,170 --> 03:00:42,250
What are you talking about?

2151
03:00:43,630 --> 03:00:44,706
What are you talking about?

2152
03:00:44,730 --> 03:00:45,810
What are you talking about?

2153
03:00:47,190 --> 03:00:48,590
I'm talking about Neon Key Feather.

2154
03:00:52,725 --> 03:00:53,990
Is this a dream?

2155
03:00:55,110 --> 03:00:56,110
Good morning.

2156
03:00:57,090 --> 03:00:58,090
Good morning.

2157
03:01:01,170 --> 03:01:02,430
What time is it now?

2158
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:04,910
Is it morning already?

2159
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:06,070
It's morning already.

2160
03:01:07,325 --> 03:01:08,605
It's almost time to say goodbye.

2161
03:01:10,280 --> 03:01:12,170
I don't want to say goodbye.

2162
03:01:20,440 --> 03:01:23,310
I don't want to say goodbye.

2163
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:36,310
I don't want to say goodbye.

2164
03:01:51,450 --> 03:01:52,450
Oh, wow.

2165
03:01:56,430 --> 03:01:57,450
Oh, wow.

2166
03:01:58,090 --> 03:01:59,090
Oh, no.

2167
03:02:38,530 --> 03:02:39,530
I'm not done yet.

2168
03:02:39,610 --> 03:02:40,610
I'm not done yet.

2169
03:02:41,030 --> 03:02:42,030
That's right.

2170
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:49,720
I'm lonely.

2171
03:02:51,170 --> 03:02:51,780
Did you wake up?

2172
03:02:51,781 --> 03:02:54,060
What's wrong?

2173
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:26,810
I don't know if it feels good or not.

2174
03:03:30,810 --> 03:03:31,830
My legs are shaking.

2175
03:03:35,590 --> 03:03:36,170
There.

2176
03:03:36,171 --> 03:03:37,171
Let's do it here.

2177
03:03:40,370 --> 03:03:41,450
The part you like the most.

2178
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:54,800
Why are you standing like that?

2179
03:04:04,690 --> 03:04:09,080
You like to be scratched
like this, don't you?

2180
03:04:09,081 --> 03:04:10,081
You like it, don't you?

2181
03:04:10,180 --> 03:04:13,140
Yes, I do.

2182
03:04:13,141 --> 03:04:14,200
I love it.

2183
03:04:22,620 --> 03:04:27,060
It's so hot in the morning.

2184
03:04:48,020 --> 03:04:49,580
Yes, it is.

2185
03:04:49,581 --> 03:04:50,581
It's amazing.

2186
03:04:53,740 --> 03:04:55,180
You have a lot of hair on your nose.

2187
03:04:56,100 --> 03:04:57,100
Really?

2188
03:05:01,480 --> 03:05:03,480
You really like bunnies, don't you?

2189
03:05:05,230 --> 03:05:09,320
Yes, I do.

2190
03:05:09,321 --> 03:05:10,480
I love bunnies.

2191
03:05:21,210 --> 03:05:30,890
Does it feel good?

2192
03:05:31,110 --> 03:05:32,110
Yes, it feels good.

2193
03:05:59,400 --> 03:06:00,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2194
03:06:12,820 --> 03:06:14,380
You're very sensitive from the morning.

2195
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:17,780
Because it's such a gross morning.

2196
03:06:18,850 --> 03:06:20,760
Oh, it's more sensitive.

2197
03:06:58,070 --> 03:07:00,710
This is the last time you're
going to drink gin and gin like this.

2198
03:07:04,610 --> 03:07:05,650
I'll drink it all at once.

2199
03:07:08,450 --> 03:07:09,790
Oh, it's scary.

2200
03:07:15,150 --> 03:07:17,620
You can't forget my fur.

2201
03:08:13,330 --> 03:08:18,720
You can't hold it anymore?

2202
03:08:18,721 --> 03:08:19,721
Are you sleepy?

2203
03:08:22,300 --> 03:08:23,340
It's too early.

2204
03:08:27,510 --> 03:08:29,440
I'll make you feel better.

2205
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:31,640
Really?

2206
03:08:33,685 --> 03:08:34,925
I want to make you feel better.

2207
03:08:42,190 --> 03:08:46,120
I want to make you feel better.

2208
03:09:34,700 --> 03:09:40,020
It's hot.

2209
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:47,100
It's hot.

2210
03:09:53,355 --> 03:09:56,300
Drink a lot.

2211
03:10:34,665 --> 03:10:40,430
It's hot.

2212
03:12:00,650 --> 03:12:06,150
It's hot, isn't it?

2213
03:12:15,230 --> 03:12:16,230
It's hot, isn't it?

2214
03:12:17,410 --> 03:12:19,530
How do you feel?

2215
03:12:42,260 --> 03:12:44,640
Hey, lick me more.

2216
03:12:49,120 --> 03:12:50,740
Move your tongue a lot.

2217
03:13:40,590 --> 03:13:47,150
It's great that you feel so good.

2218
03:14:17,440 --> 03:14:18,440
Can I lick you?

2219
03:14:18,980 --> 03:14:19,980
Can I lick you?

2220
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:24,140
You've grown up.

2221
03:14:30,985 --> 03:14:32,080
You like this, don't you?

2222
03:14:37,550 --> 03:14:39,290
Oh, it feels good.

2223
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:50,570
Oh, that part.

2224
03:14:50,571 --> 03:14:52,230
How do you feel?

2225
03:14:52,231 --> 03:14:53,590
Did you wash your feet?

2226
03:14:57,780 --> 03:14:59,430
Does it feel good?

2227
03:15:01,390 --> 03:15:03,470
I can see you licking it.

2228
03:15:36,240 --> 03:15:37,410
Next, turn your head.

2229
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:46,720
You know what to do, don't you?

2230
03:15:55,900 --> 03:15:57,480
You're all looking around.

2231
03:15:59,230 --> 03:15:59,880
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

2232
03:15:59,881 --> 03:16:01,380
I'm sorry.

2233
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:08,760
Oh, my God. You're feeling it a lot.

2234
03:16:17,590 --> 03:16:18,660
This is good.

2235
03:16:36,650 --> 03:16:43,130
Oh, no.

2236
03:16:45,580 --> 03:16:47,210
Oh, no.

2237
03:16:47,211 --> 03:16:48,211
It's fun.

2238
03:16:57,050 --> 03:16:58,890
Oh, no.

2239
03:16:59,870 --> 03:17:01,070
Oh, no.

2240
03:17:02,270 --> 03:17:03,270
What's wrong?

2241
03:17:03,805 --> 03:17:04,805
It's getting worse.

2242
03:17:06,770 --> 03:17:07,770
No.

2243
03:17:08,050 --> 03:17:09,050
Hang in there.

2244
03:17:11,200 --> 03:17:12,570
I haven't put it in yet.

2245
03:17:15,470 --> 03:17:16,470
I can't help it.

2246
03:17:16,590 --> 03:17:17,590
I want to put it in.

2247
03:17:18,270 --> 03:17:19,450
Let's put it in as it is.

2248
03:17:21,170 --> 03:17:23,610
I wonder if it will fit.

2249
03:17:27,730 --> 03:17:29,010
Do your best.

2250
03:17:30,490 --> 03:17:31,490
I'm going to put it in.

2251
03:17:39,590 --> 03:17:40,340
Can you see it?

2252
03:17:40,341 --> 03:17:44,040
It's in there.

2253
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:47,200
Wow.

2254
03:17:50,220 --> 03:17:54,380
Can you see it?

2255
03:17:54,381 --> 03:17:55,381
I can't do it.

2256
03:17:58,100 --> 03:18:02,100
Oh, no.

2257
03:18:02,600 --> 03:18:07,000
Oh, no.

2258
03:18:08,530 --> 03:18:10,240
This posture is embarrassing.

2259
03:18:10,880 --> 03:18:18,320
I can't do it.

2260
03:18:21,220 --> 03:18:22,200
I can't do it.

2261
03:18:22,201 --> 03:18:24,220
No?

2262
03:18:24,600 --> 03:18:25,700
No?

2263
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:28,440
Please stay like this.

2264
03:18:30,140 --> 03:18:31,140
Okay.

2265
03:18:32,740 --> 03:18:33,900
I want you to stay like this.

2266
03:18:44,240 --> 03:18:47,880
I'm so tired.

2267
03:19:30,930 --> 03:19:33,230
You don't want to take a break, do you?

2268
03:19:37,470 --> 03:19:39,190
It feels so good.

2269
03:20:09,710 --> 03:20:11,050
It's getting harder and harder.

2270
03:20:17,310 --> 03:20:17,870
You can do it.

2271
03:20:17,871 --> 03:20:19,050
No, you can't.

2272
03:20:19,510 --> 03:20:20,510
Let's go.

2273
03:20:20,670 --> 03:20:21,670
You can't.

2274
03:20:21,870 --> 03:20:22,870
I can't.

2275
03:20:24,645 --> 03:20:26,350
Please let me sleep.

2276
03:20:27,470 --> 03:20:28,470
Let me sleep.

2277
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:30,890
I can't.

2278
03:20:30,891 --> 03:20:31,891
I'll go to the hospital.

2279
03:20:38,070 --> 03:20:40,330
I told you I want to sleep.

2280
03:20:42,910 --> 03:20:43,910
Go to sleep.

2281
03:20:44,510 --> 03:20:46,470
But you can do it again, can't you?

2282
03:21:03,080 --> 03:21:04,730
You're going too fast.

2283
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:13,890
I'm going to lift you up again.

2284
03:21:20,210 --> 03:21:21,650
Ah...

2285
03:21:25,410 --> 03:21:26,650
It's just a little bit painful.

2286
03:21:30,860 --> 03:21:32,330
It's just a little bit painful.

2287
03:21:33,350 --> 03:21:36,910
It's just a little bit painful, but
I know it's going to be better.

2288
03:21:42,890 --> 03:21:43,890
You can do it.

2289
03:21:44,370 --> 03:21:44,830
Can I?

2290
03:21:44,970 --> 03:21:45,970
You can do it.

2291
03:21:46,860 --> 03:21:48,150
Next, from behind.

2292
03:21:51,990 --> 03:21:54,750
I'll lend it to you.

2293
03:22:36,155 --> 03:22:40,880
It hurts a lot.

2294
03:22:54,540 --> 03:22:57,110
No, I don't know.

2295
03:22:58,090 --> 03:22:59,090
More.

2296
03:23:01,490 --> 03:23:03,090
I can't do it.

2297
03:23:11,800 --> 03:23:12,800
Wait.

2298
03:23:13,380 --> 03:23:14,480
I can't do it.

2299
03:23:24,470 --> 03:23:25,520
I feel sick.

2300
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:18,680
It's so hot.

2301
03:24:18,681 --> 03:24:19,681
It feels so good.

2302
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:21,320
It's so hot.

2303
03:24:25,640 --> 03:24:26,640
I'm sorry.

2304
03:24:40,820 --> 03:24:41,820
Oh, no.

2305
03:24:42,680 --> 03:24:43,680
Are you all right?

2306
03:24:44,140 --> 03:24:44,380
Are you all right?

2307
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:46,000
It hurts.

2308
03:24:47,500 --> 03:24:49,020
Give me some medicine.

2309
03:24:50,540 --> 03:24:51,740
I have a lot of medicine.

2310
03:24:52,640 --> 03:24:53,640
I'll give you some.

2311
03:25:33,220 --> 03:25:34,820
It's hot.

2312
03:25:34,821 --> 03:25:36,140
It's not over yet, is it?

2313
03:25:40,980 --> 03:25:42,300
You're still so energetic.

2314
03:25:42,301 --> 03:25:45,200
You can do it, can't you?

2315
03:25:45,480 --> 03:25:46,480
You can do it, can't you?

2316
03:25:46,900 --> 03:25:47,900
You're a good boy.

2317
03:26:08,810 --> 03:26:13,950
Oh, no!

2318
03:26:23,690 --> 03:26:24,690
Oh, no!

2319
03:26:25,050 --> 03:26:26,050
Oh, no!

2320
03:26:26,380 --> 03:26:27,590
Oh, no!

2321
03:26:27,591 --> 03:26:35,450
Hurry up!

2322
03:26:35,750 --> 03:26:36,170
Hurry up!

2323
03:26:36,450 --> 03:26:37,450
It's okay.

2324
03:26:41,350 --> 03:26:43,290
Why are you crying?

2325
03:27:07,780 --> 03:27:09,300
Give me a hug.

2326
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:16,600
I'm going to go.

2327
03:27:16,880 --> 03:27:17,700
I'm going to go.

2328
03:27:17,701 --> 03:27:18,701
You're going again?

2329
03:27:19,080 --> 03:27:20,320
I want to put it on your boobs.

2330
03:27:21,840 --> 03:27:22,916
I want to put it on your boobs.

2331
03:27:22,940 --> 03:27:23,780
I don't like it.

2332
03:27:23,820 --> 03:27:23,860
I don't like it.

2333
03:27:23,861 --> 03:27:24,380
I don't want to.

2334
03:27:24,720 --> 03:27:26,540
I don't want to.

2335
03:27:26,541 --> 03:27:27,541
You don't want to?

2336
03:27:27,990 --> 03:27:31,040
I don't want to.

2337
03:27:31,140 --> 03:27:36,680
You can do it.

2338
03:27:37,800 --> 03:27:39,000
I don't want to.

2339
03:27:42,920 --> 03:27:43,920
You're almost there.

2340
03:27:48,090 --> 03:27:53,620
It's so hard.

2341
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:01,720
You're still like this?

2342
03:28:03,700 --> 03:28:04,980
You're so energetic.

2343
03:28:09,160 --> 03:28:10,440
I'll clean you up.

2344
03:28:15,230 --> 03:28:22,040
It's not over yet.

2345
03:28:30,520 --> 03:28:32,600
Don't run away.

2346
03:28:33,760 --> 03:28:34,760
What?

2347
03:28:36,480 --> 03:28:37,820
Don't run away.

2348
03:28:42,090 --> 03:28:46,080
You're going to fall.

2349
03:28:49,630 --> 03:28:50,980
Don't run away.

2350
03:28:52,670 --> 03:28:54,940
It's not over yet.

2351
03:29:05,305 --> 03:29:06,305
I can't do it.

2352
03:29:07,660 --> 03:29:13,540
I can't do it.

2353
03:29:15,960 --> 03:29:17,280
You can do it.

2354
03:29:17,281 --> 03:29:18,281
You can do it, right?

2355
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:20,500
I did my best.

2356
03:29:21,540 --> 03:29:22,580
Why did you do your best?

2357
03:29:24,780 --> 03:29:26,400
Are you done?

2358
03:29:26,401 --> 03:29:26,440
Did you have fun?

2359
03:29:27,140 --> 03:29:28,280
I had a lot of fun.

2360
03:29:30,170 --> 03:29:31,180
Let's go on a date again.

2361
03:29:32,105 --> 03:29:33,105
Yes, by all means.
