1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Steaming

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
It's this good

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,840
Is your Inner Box mostly used?

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,840
I'm going to pour the sauce on top of the rice

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
This is a souvenir

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Oh, a souvenir?

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,840
That's good

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,840
I didn't think it would taste good

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
It's really good

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
I have a good sake

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Do you want to drink?

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
I want to drink

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm going to taste it now

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,840
It's not hot at all

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,840
It looks delicious

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,840
It's not hot at all

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,840
It's easy to melt

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
What is this?

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
I think it's already melted.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
What?

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
It's already melted.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
What?

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
That's right.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
That's right.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
That's right.

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Do you guys usually do this?

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
You're a pervert.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Don't do sex with me.

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Don't do sex with me.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
You're the only one doing it, aren't you?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
I don't like it.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Don't do sex with me.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
I love you, I love you.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
No, no.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
It feels good.

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
I don't know what to do.

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
I don't know what to do.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
I see.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
By the way,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
did you say you wanted to ask me something?

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Yeah.

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
What is it?

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
If it's something other than money,

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
I'll ask you anything.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Kuroko, I have something I want to try.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
What?

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
What do you want to try?

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
I'm sorry for making you eat so much food.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
It's okay.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
You can eat as much as you want.

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,840
So, how are you doing recently?

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
What?

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Aren't you going to make a child?

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Well, I've been thinking about it a lot, but I don't know if I can do it.

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,840
I can't make a child because my parents are strict.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
That's right.

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,840
My parents say, make it, make it, but it's noisy.

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
That's right.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
That's right.

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,840
By the way, where are Yasu-kun and the others?

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Huh?

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,340
Sutan went to the bathroom.

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Both of you?

65
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,140
Yeah.

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,940
The bathroom?

67
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,640
Yeah.

68
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Is she a girl?

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Hahaha.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
I wonder why.

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Right?

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,240
I wonder why she's doing that.

73
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Hahaha.

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,540
I wonder if it's okay if we only talk to each other.

75
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,840
I don't like it.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,440
Hahaha.

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't like it.

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,340
Hey.

79
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,940
Let's not talk about it.

80
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,640
I mean,

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,040
you're not serious, are you?

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,240
Hey.

83
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
What are you talking about?

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
No, I don't think so.

85
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,440
You were staring at Yuu, weren't you?

86
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,440
You're so mean.

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
No, no, no.

88
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
I can hear you.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
You can hear me, right?

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
I can hear you.

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,440
While you're here,

92
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Please stop it.

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,440
I don't have anything to do with you anyway.

94
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
You're tired of me, aren't you?

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
No, I'm not.

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Your wife and my wife.

97
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Which one is better?

98
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Let's exchange.

99
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
No, I don't think so.

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I can't do it anymore.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
At that time, I couldn't resist the words of my childhood friend, SHINODA.

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I don't want to see his wife, Yuu-chan, and me, but I want to see it.

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I want to see it.

104
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,440
In this way, the childhood dream and the childhood dream

105
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,440
are going to stay in my house for 4 days.

106
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
It's a little embarrassing.

107
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
You're taking a break?

109
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
How are you?

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
It's so painful.

111
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm so sorry.

112
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
She's just a child.

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
No...

117
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I'm sorry...

118
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,440
YASUKE, no...

119
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,440
No...

120
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm sorry...

121
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm sorry...

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
No...

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm sorry...

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Let's do it again.

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Let's do it again.

126
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Let's do it again.

127
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
Let's do it again.

128
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm embarrassed.

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

130
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

131
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
It's okay, it's okay.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
It's okay.

133
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:37,440
It's been a while since I've done it, so I'd like to exchange it for a while.

134
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
You don't have to say it now.

136
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Hey.

137
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,440
What do you mean by exchange?

138
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
It's obvious.

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
It's him, right?

140
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
He's a real man.

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
He's a real man.

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
He's a real man.

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
He's a real man.

144
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm an adult.

145
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Yasu-kun...

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
So...

147
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I'll do what Sumire-chan does...

148
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,440
So you're going to do it with Shinji?

149
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Sounds fun, right?

150
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
You're in trouble.

151
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
No, it's fun.

152
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I was surprised.

154
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
You don't have to say it now.

156
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I don't know.

157
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I was surprised.

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Mom.

159
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Are you okay?

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Are you okay?

161
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
What's going on?

162
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Well...

163
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Well...

164
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Well, it's okay.

165
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
We talked about this before.

166
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Yeah.

167
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
What?

168
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Really?

169
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Hey,

171
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
I want to talk to you alone.

172
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
What?

173
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Yeah.

174
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I'll be right back.

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's go.

176
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I wonder if he's okay.

177
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Didn't he catch a cold?

178
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Sumire-chan.

179
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I don't think he's okay.

180
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Yeah, I think so.

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I was going to tell you something.

182
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
What?

183
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Well, that's what happened.

184
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,440
What do you mean?

185
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,440
No, I'm not talking about that.

186
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,440
You told me about our vanilla ice cream before, didn't you?

187
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I may have told you, but that and this...

188
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:11,440
So I was wondering if it would be better to do something like that.

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
But...

190
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:24,440
If that's the case, I'll have to do it with Yasu-kun, so is that okay?

191
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,440
It's not good, but it's not something you don't know.

192
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,440
That will make our friendship even better. I think that's better.

193
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Just once.

194
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Just once is enough.

195
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm begging you.

196
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm begging you.

197
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Just like this.

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Sumire, I'm begging you.

199
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's do it.

200
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Okay, let's do it.

201
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
We've been talking.

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Who's going to do it?

203
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Who's going to do it?

204
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,440
What should I do?

205
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,440
What should I do?

206
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
What should I do?

207
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm dying more than I am.

208
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,440
You're dying more than you are.

209
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,440
What should I do?

210
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Close your eyes.

211
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Close your eyes.

212
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Close your eyes.

213
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Good.

214
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Now close your eyes.

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Good.

216
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Ok.

217
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Let's start from Shinji.

218
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
You're okay, aren't you?

219
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Yeah, I'm fine.

220
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
You're okay, aren't you?

221
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I've never done this before.

222
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,440
But everyone does it, right?

223
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
One day.

224
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
It's cold.

225
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
I can't take it off.

226
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, I see.

227
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
You don't kiss often, do you?

229
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Kiss?

230
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
You don't kiss often, do you?

231
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Are you cold?

232
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Are you okay?

233
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
It's embarrassing.

234
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
What are you talking about?

235
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,440
How long are you going to keep it in your hand?

236
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Or do you want to hug each other?

237
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Or do you want to kiss each other?

238
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Kiss me.

239
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Really?

240
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Like this?

241
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Like this?

242
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
It's not bad, isn't it?

243
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Is it okay?

244
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Only us?

245
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Not only us.

246
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
We'll do it later.

247
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
I see.

248
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Yes, that's right.

249
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Do you want to kiss me?

250
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Yes, I do.

251
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Do you want to?

252
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
That's right.

253
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Do you want me to kiss you?

254
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm so embarrassed.

255
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Are you going home?

256
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Yes.

257
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Don't be shy.

258
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm embarrassed.

259
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
People are staring at me.

260
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Don't worry about me.

261
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm worried about you.

262
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Let's take a picture.

263
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm embarrassed.

264
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Don't look at me like that when you look at me like this.

265
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
It's like a curtain.

266
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
What's wrong?

267
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Can I sit down?

268
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
It's hard to do, isn't it?

269
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
No.

270
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Like this?

271
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Yes.

272
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
It's embarrassing.

273
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Yeah.

279
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
What should I do?

280
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Yeah.

281
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Feels good.

282
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
Yeah.

283
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
You know...

284
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Hey,

285
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,440
you should lick the chair too.

286
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,440
Don't lick it too much.

287
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
This way?

288
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
It's your favorite place.

289
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Can I take it off?

290
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Wow!

291
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
It's okay.

292
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
It's really standing.

293
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Wow, you look strong.

294
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Can I really lick you?

295
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
You really want to lick me, don't you?

296
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,440
Wow, look.

297
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,440
It's like this.

298
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
It's strong.

299
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,440
It's harder than mine.

300
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
You're lying.

301
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
You're lying.

302
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
I thought you weren't going to eat it.

303
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
It's delicious.

304
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
It's a fresh taste.

305
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't know.

306
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
I don't know what to do.

307
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
I want to see your face.

308
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Can I talk to you for a minute?

309
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,440
I feel like I'm doing something bad.

310
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
It's not bad at all.

311
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Really?

312
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Really.

313
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:56,440
It's the first time you're licking me in front of people like this.

314
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Look.

315
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,440
You're curious about our politics, aren't you?

316
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
It's really intense.

317
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Don't worry about me.

319
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
It's embarrassing to do it.

320
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
What about me?

321
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
It's okay.

322
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
You're already wet.

323
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
I'm not.

324
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
It's okay.

325
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I want you to be embarrassed.

326
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I'm not embarrassed.

327
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm not embarrassed.

328
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
I'll close the door.

329
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
No.

330
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Can I have a look?

331
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Don't spread it out. It's embarrassing.

332
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
I want to take a look.

333
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Oh no.

334
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
It's in the bubble.

335
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
It's not coming?

336
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
It's a little embarrassing.

337
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
It's jealous.

338
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
It's soaked in blood.

339
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,440
I don't like this. It's embarrassing.

340
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Don't touch it like that.

341
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
I can't do it anymore.

342
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
It's embarrassing.

343
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
It's close.

344
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
What are you doing?

345
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
What are you doing?

346
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
You don't have to lick it.

347
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
You don't like it?

348
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
You lick it.

349
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
It's embarrassing.

350
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
It's embarrassing.

351
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Don't look at me like that.

352
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Wait a minute.

353
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Shien-chan, come here.

355
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Come here.

356
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
What?

357
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Put it in.

358
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
I want to put it in.

359
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
What do you mean?

360
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,440
I like it when you hit me from the back.

361
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Are you sure?

362
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Of course I'm sure.

363
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Really?

364
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Wait a minute.

365
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Sorry.

366
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Here you go.

367
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
What are you doing?

368
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
What are you doing?

369
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't you put on the rubber?

370
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
It feels good.

371
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,440
It looks easy, but...

372
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I'm doing it live.

373
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Are you sure?

374
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm fine with it.

375
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Then I'm fine with it.

376
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm fine with it if you're fine with it.

377
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,440
You want to do it in person, don't you?

378
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Are you sure?

379
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Yes.

380
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,440
I want to do it in person.

381
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I'll do it.

382
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Are you sure?

383
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, it's cold.

384
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Oh, it's cold.

385
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
It's hard.

386
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Shin-chan's...

387
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
It's amazing.

388
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Oh, it's gross.

389
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Ah, it feels good.

390
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
It feels good.

391
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Amazing.

392
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
You're amazing.

393
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
It feels bad.

394
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
It's bad.

395
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,440
I feel like I'm going to die.

396
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Wait a minute.

397
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm sorry.

398
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,440
I can't do it anymore.

399
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm dying.

400
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
This is amazing.

401
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
This feels so good.

402
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Let's go.

403
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
It's so hard.

404
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm dying.

405
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
I'm dying.

406
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Why is it so hard?

407
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Please do it again.

409
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Is it okay to do this?

410
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Is it okay, Sumie?

411
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Don't worry about it.

412
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
It's really big.

413
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Amazing.

414
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,440
I want to do more.

415
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Can I get on it?

416
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Yes.

417
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,440
I feel like I'm doing something bad.

418
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Are you okay?

419
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Yes.

420
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm going to sleep.

421
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
What should I do?

422
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
I can't see my body.

423
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm so nervous.

424
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm scared.

425
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,440
What should I do? I have coke in my mouth.

426
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
You can see it well.

427
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Is it okay to do this?

428
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
I don't know what to do.

429
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
I'm in trouble.

430
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Should I give up?

431
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
I told you.

432
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm not good at it.

433
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
I'll do a little more.

434
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
No, no.

435
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,440
No, no.

436
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
No, no.

437
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Just a little more.

438
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
What?

439
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
How is it?

440
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
It's dirty.

441
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Is it okay to do this?

442
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
It's all wet.

443
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
I'll wipe it a little more.

444
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Is it okay?

445
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
It's not messy.

446
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Shin-chan, you're amazing.

447
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Are you okay?

448
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
I feel good.

450
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Shhh.

451
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Here.

452
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Sen-chan.

453
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Don't be shy.

454
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
It's better to lie down.

455
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Like this.

456
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Like this?

457
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Yes.

458
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
I can see Sen-chan's face well.

459
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
It's scary.

460
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
It feels good.

462
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
If you're about to die,

463
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I'll get you out of there.

464
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
What?

465
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,440
I want to see you get out of there.

466
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
What are you talking about?

467
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
That's not good.

468
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
I don't care.

469
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,440
I'll get you out of there.

470
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Isn't it dangerous if I release it inside?

471
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
I feel like I'm going to die.

472
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm in trouble.

473
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
I'm going to die.

474
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
I'm going to die.

475
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm in trouble.

476
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Ah!!

477
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Ah!!

478
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Shin-chan!!

479
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Shuu!

480
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,440
He's moving!!

481
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Oh!

482
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
He's getting out!!

483
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,440
What should I do?

484
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Ouch!!

485
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Shin-chan!!

486
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
What should I do!?

487
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Are you okay?

488
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Are you okay?

489
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Are you okay?

490
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
What should I do?

491
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
It was good, wasn't it?

492
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
It was good, but

493
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
I wonder if it's okay.

494
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
It was really good.

495
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,440
What should I do?

496
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
It can't be helped.

497
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Let's all have fun together, okay?

498
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
I'm not bad at anything.

499
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Shin-chan is good too, but if you give it a try,

500
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
you'll get used to it.

501
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Okay?

502
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Okay?

503
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,440
I don't care about Shinta, but I want to try it once.

504
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
You're fast.

505
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
No, it doesn't matter.

506
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
Yeah.

507
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Right?

508
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Yeah.

509
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
I knew it.

511
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I'm sorry.

512
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm sorry.

513
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm sorry.

514
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:27,480
Just in time, the

515
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
It's not good for the couple to get wet.

517
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
We decided to stay here today.

518
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
It's ok.

519
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
You should take a shower.

520
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Since we're here, let's do it together.

521
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Okay.

522
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Bye.

523
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Did you feel good?

524
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
I'm listening to you.

525
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Did you feel good?

526
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I was nervous.

527
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I was nervous, but it felt good.

528
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Really?

529
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Really?

530
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
I forgot.

531
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Hehehe

532
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
It's warm.

533
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,480
This is how I embraced my childhood friend's dream.

534
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,480
I couldn't tell my wife that I was so excited that I was embarrassed.

535
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,480
And after that, a surprising sight was waiting for me.

536
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm sorry.

537
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
I'm sorry.

538
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
I'm sorry.

539
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
It's amazing.

541
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Don't look at me.

542
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
My dream came true when I got out of the bath.

543
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Moreover,

544
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
while I was being filmed,

545
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I was drooling with an expression that I had never seen before.

546
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Jealousy?

547
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Excitement?

548
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,480
On that day, I was so excited that I woke up in the morning.

549
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
In the end, I couldn't sleep at all.

550
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I was busy with Shinoda's dream.

551
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Of course, Sumire also went to Shinodani.

552
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
You're good at cooking.

553
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
The more we were in a rush to get dressed,

554
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,480
the more naturally we headed for the morning.

555
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm looking forward to it.

556
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Do I?

557
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Do I look like that?

558
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
No, you don't look like that.

559
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Oh, right.

560
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Mr. Kurokawa.

561
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Do you want to see what we took yesterday?

562
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
It's okay.

563
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
You took a good picture.

564
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Let's see it.

565
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
It's embarrassing.

566
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Let's see it here.

567
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Let's see it together.

568
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
I'm ready.

569
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I'm ready.

570
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm ready.

571
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
It's hard to sit down.

572
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
It's hot.

573
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Amazing.

574
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
It's fun.

575
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
It's amazing.

576
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
It's amazing.

577
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
It feels good, doesn't it?

578
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
It feels good.

579
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
It feels good, doesn't it?

580
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
I'm tired.

581
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
I'm tired.

582
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
You feel good?

583
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Yes.

584
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Are you happy?

585
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Yes.

586
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Did you feel good?

587
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
What?

588
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Did you feel good?

589
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Yes

590
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
That's good

591
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I'll show you.

592
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Here you go.

593
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Thank you.

594
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
You're welcome.

595
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Thank you.

596
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Are you okay?

597
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm fine.

598
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm fine.

599
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
You're strange.

600
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
I'm fine.

601
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
I'm fine.

602
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Do you want to drop it?

603
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
I don't want to drop it.

604
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
I want to get used to it.

605
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Put it here.

606
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Put it in.

607
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
It feels good.

608
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,480
I want to lie down and stretch.

609
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
It feels good.

610
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,480
It feels good.

611
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
It feels good.

612
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
I'm so sorry.

613
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm so sorry.

614
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,480
You're sleeping a lot.

615
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,480
You can sleep like this when you're sleeping.

616
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Did you sleep?

617
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,480
I slept.

618
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,480
I'm afraid you will get up.

619
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,480
Who?

620
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,480
I'm afraid you will get up.

621
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,480
It's embarrassing to do this.

622
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,480
I'm afraid you will get up.

623
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,480
But I can't do anything about it.

624
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,480
I'm so tired.

625
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,480
I'm so tired.

626
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I'm so tired.

627
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,480
I'm so tired.

628
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,480
I'm so tired.

629
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,480
I'm so tired.

630
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,480
I want to go home.

631
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,480
I want to go to the hospital.

632
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,480
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat like this in my life.

633
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,480
I've never seen a cat like this in my life.

634
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,480
I've never seen a cat like this in my life.

635
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,480
I have to put up with it

636
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,480
I'm so hungry

637
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,480
I'm so hungry

638
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Well, I'll choose this one first.

639
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,480
No, I can't.

640
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,480
I have 13.

641
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,480
What? You have more?

642
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,480
Yes, I have more.

643
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,480
What? You have more?

644
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,480
Yes, I have more.

645
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,480
You have more?

646
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,480
I have more.

647
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,480
I haven't seen it.

648
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,480
Hey, I have more.

649
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,480
You have more.

650
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,480
I have more.

651
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:41,480
Oh, 9 again.

652
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Oh, it's close.

653
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:51,480
7? I've never seen 7.

654
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,480
9.

655
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,480
You just said 9.

656
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,480
I saw something around here.

657
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,480
It's totally different.

658
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,480
Where are you going?

659
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,480
Amazing!

660
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,480
You're a genius.

661
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,480
I haven't taken a single picture yet.

662
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,480
I've seen it before.

663
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,480
No, I haven't taken a single picture yet.

664
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,480
Really?

665
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
Oh, it's amazing.

666
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,480
Amazing, amazing.

667
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,480
A gun?

668
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,480
A gun?

669
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,480
I have one.

670
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,480
You have a good memory.

671
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,480
Amazing.

672
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,480
I have one.

673
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,480
What about this one?

674
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,480
I haven't found anything in this area.

675
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,480
Huh?

676
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,480
I haven't found anything yet.

677
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,480
Wait, I don't know what it is.

678
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,480
I saw it around here.

679
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,480
It looks like me, though.

680
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,480
I came up with an interesting game.

681
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,480
What is it?

682
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,480
Can I try it?

683
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,480
What is it?

684
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,480
Can I?

685
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,480
What is it?

686
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,480
I'm getting tired of this game.

687
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,480
I think so, too.

688
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,480
It's like a game where two people are blindfolded and one of them gets the right answer.

689
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,480
What is it?

690
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,480
It's a little funny, isn't it?

691
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,480
It's easy, isn't it?

692
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,480
It's easy.

693
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,480
It's 1 in 2.

694
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,480
It's obvious.

695
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,480
Don't you have anything to write?

696
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,480
I have.

697
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,480
Let me see.

698
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,480
It's easy.

699
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,480
Do you understand?

700
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,480
I understand.

701
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Why are you so confident?

702
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,480
What's that?

703
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,800
You can use it when you go to bed.

704
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Is it a plane?

705
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,000
You can use it.

706
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This is the one that can be given to you.

707
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Let's do it one by one.

708
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
One by one?

709
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It's a referee.

710
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I can't see it at all.

711
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I can't see it at all.

712
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I can't see it at all.

713
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Are you going to start already?

714
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Let's start.

715
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Let's get started.

716
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I'm so motivated.

717
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Let's do it quickly.

718
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Come a little closer.

719
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Wait, wait.

720
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Isn't it too early to make eye contact?

721
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Where?

722
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Can't you see?

723
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I can't see.

724
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It's okay.

725
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Hurry up.

726
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I'm thinking.

727
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Oh, I see.

728
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Okay.

729
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
If you lose, do you have a punishment game?

730
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You look like you have a bad feeling about this.

731
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Someone's already here, right?

732
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I screamed.

733
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I was a little scared.

734
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Wait, is it good?

735
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
It's warm. Here we go.

736
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,140
Oh, It's so good.

737
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,600
Okay, next

738
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,600
I'm going to take a bite of this.

739
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
I got it.

740
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
Really?

741
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,600
I just have to hit it gradually.

742
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,600
At first.

743
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
Can I take this off?

744
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Is it right?

745
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
I did it!

746
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
I knew it!

747
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
It's the correct answer with the first try!

748
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,600
I knew it!

749
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
I knew it!

750
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
I knew it!

751
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
I knew it!

752
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,600
I knew it!

753
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,600
I knew it!

754
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,600
I can't see anything.

755
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,600
I can't see anything.

756
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,600
I see.

757
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Please.

758
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,600
I was surprised.

759
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,600
I was really surprised.

760
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
What are you doing?

761
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,600
What are you doing?

762
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
Are you okay?

763
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,600
Wow

764
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,600
What?

765
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Is it good?

766
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:57,420
I was surprised again.

767
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:03,420
Oh, I see.

768
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:12,420
What? You don't get it?

769
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,420
What? Is it the beginning?

770
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,420
No.

771
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,420
You got it right!

772
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,420
Really?

773
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,420
You got it right!

774
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,420
No way!

775
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,420
You're a good girl.

776
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,420
You know what you're doing.

777
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,420
You're my husband.

778
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,420
I'm going to take it off.

779
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,420
What?

780
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,420
No, no, no.

781
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,420
I was surprised.

782
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:40,420
I took it off.

783
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,420
What?

784
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,420
I don't know if it was a coincidence.

785
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,420
I'll do it again.

786
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:48,420
It's still a little bit...

787
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,420
It's okay.

788
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,420
Leave it to me.

789
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,420
Actually, men are full-time.

790
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,420
Stick together a little more.

791
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,420
About this.

792
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,420
Like this?

793
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,420
Yes, there are men.

794
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,420
Are you ready?

795
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,420
My heart is pounding.

796
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,420
It's a heart.

797
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,420
Hmm?

798
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,420
Hmm?

799
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,420
Hmm?

800
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,420
I know

801
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,420
Hmm?

802
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,420
I don't know

803
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,420
It's hard, isn't it?

804
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,420
Hmm?

805
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,420
It's 그때

806
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:03,560
It's hot.

807
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,620
It's totally different

808
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,620
Mmm!

809
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
Mmm?

810
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,620
Mmm!

811
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,620
It's getting harder.

812
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,620
I don't know.

813
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,620
It's harder than the last one.

814
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,620
Yeah.

815
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,620
There is a pattern that has not been replaced, isn't it?

816
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,620
Yes, yes, yes.

817
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,620
I don't know.

818
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,620
I can't see it.

819
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,620
Hm?

820
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,620
Hm?

821
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,620
Hm?

822
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,620
Hm?

823
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,620
Hm?

824
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,620
Hm?

825
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,620
Hm?

826
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,620
Hm?

827
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,620
Hm?

828
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,620
Hm?

829
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,620
Hm?

830
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,620
Hm?

831
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,620
Hm?

832
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,620
Hm?

833
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,620
Hm?

834
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,620
Hm?

835
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,620
What?

836
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:07,620
Oh, it's not there.

837
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,620
What?

838
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,620
I don't know what it is.

839
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,620
Impossible.

840
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,620
What?

841
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,620
Are you looking at Japan?

842
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,620
Yes.

843
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,620
That's great.

844
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,620
I'll give you a hint.

845
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,620
I haven't answered yet.

846
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,620
What?

847
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,620
What?

848
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,620
You're so cute.

849
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,620
Where are you going?

850
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,620
What?

851
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,620
What are you doing?

852
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,620
Is there something on your forehead?

853
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,620
It's so sweet.

854
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,620
It's delicious.

855
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,620
It's delicious.

856
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:36,620
delivery

857
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,880
Your mouth is very sharp.

858
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,380
Say something.

859
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,380
It's hot.

860
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,380
It's hot.

861
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,380
It's hot.

862
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,380
Are you sweating?

863
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,380
Are you sweating?

864
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:01,380
Who's talking right now?

865
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,380
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

866
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,380
Of course I do.

867
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,380
Oh, I knew it.

868
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,380
That's what I'm talking about.

869
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,380
It's easy.

870
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,380
What?

871
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,380
I said, what?

872
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,380
You made a mistake.

873
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,380
I think I made a mistake.

874
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,380
Really?

875
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,380
It's so good.

876
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,380
It's so good.

877
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,380
It's different from usual.

878
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,380
It's amazing.

879
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,380
Really?

880
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,380
It's good.

881
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,380
It's really good.

882
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,380
It's amazing.

883
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,380
Really?

884
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,380
You taught me.

885
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:54,380
Let's change it a little bit.

886
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,380
What?

887
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,380
Mitsubi is doing it.

888
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,380
What?

889
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,380
Why do you talk like that?

890
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,380
You don't use the technique I don't do.

891
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,380
I'm using it.

892
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,380
Is it different?

893
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,380
Yes.

894
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,380
Is it different?

895
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,380
Yes, it's different.

896
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,380
Is it the same taste as before?

897
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,380
Yes.

898
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,380
It's the same taste as before.

899
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,380
You really didn't make a mistake, did you?

900
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,380
It's delicious.

901
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,380
Is it?

902
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,380
I think it's really delicious.

903
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,380
I got used to eating this.

904
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,380
Not at all.

905
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,380
It's delicious.

906
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,380
Is it delicious?

907
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,380
Oh, my!

908
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,380
No, it's coming out.

909
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,380
Why don't you want to do it?

910
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,380
I've done it many times.

911
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,380
You've done it many times.

912
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,380
I'm sorry.

913
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,380
Is it good?

914
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,380
Did you spit it out?

915
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,380
It's so good

916
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,380
It's so good

917
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:29,380
I'm going to eat a lot today.

918
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,380
It's spicy.

919
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,380
You're spitting out a lot.

920
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,380
Can I spit it out?

921
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,380
Wow!

922
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,380
It's amazing!

923
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,380
Wow!

924
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,380
It's so clear!

925
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,380
Wow!

926
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,380
It's thick!

927
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,380
It's thick!

928
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,380
It's thick!

929
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,380
It seems to be thin.

930
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,380
I didn't say that.

931
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:35,380
It's really thick!

932
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,380
Why did you hold it in your hand?

933
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,380
It's important.

934
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,380
What were you going to do?

935
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,980
I'm sorry.

936
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,380
I hate you two.

937
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,380
That was great.

938
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,580
That was fun.

939
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,780
It was fun.

940
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:54,780
This is nice.

941
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,380
So, what do you think?

942
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,880
What do you mean?

943
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,380
In the end...

944
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,380
My dream and yours...

945
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,880
Which one do you want?

946
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,880
I don't know even if you say that.

947
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,380
Which one?

948
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,880
Are you going home tomorrow?

949
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,880
Oh, I see.

950
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,880
What should I do?

951
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,880
What should I do?

952
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,880
You don't hate my voice anymore, do you?

953
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,880
You don't hate my voice anymore, do you?

954
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,880
You don't hate my voice anymore, do you?

955
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,880
You don't hate my voice anymore, do you?

956
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,880
What should I do?

957
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,580
Thank you so much for smile.

958
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,260
Are you ready?

959
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,100
You are?

960
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,160
Yes!

961
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,460
I'm glad to hear that.

962
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,560
Are you ready to go home?

963
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,240
Yes!

964
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,280
Today is our last day of school.

965
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,280
Yeah.

966
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,280
It was fun.

967
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,280
Yeah.

968
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,280
There's still time until the plane, right?

969
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,280
Yeah.

970
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,280
There is.

971
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,280
Hey,

972
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
since we're here,

973
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,280
Let's do it together.

974
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,280
Together.

975
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,280
You are getting taller.

976
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,280
You are getting taller.

977
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,280
It's okay.

978
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,280
It's okay.

979
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,280
It's okay.

980
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,280
You're sleeping.

981
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,280
I'm happy.

982
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,280
Are you okay?

983
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,280
Are you okay?

984
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,280
Are you okay?

985
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,280
I'm okay.

986
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,280
I'm okay.

987
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,280
Are you okay?

988
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,280
I'm okay.

989
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,280
Oh, it's hot.

990
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,280
It's hot.

991
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,280
It's hot.

992
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,280
It's hot.

993
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,280
I don't want to do it anymore.

994
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,280
I don't want to do it anymore.

995
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,280
It's not over yet?

996
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,280
It's not over yet. It's not over yet.

997
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,280
Are you okay?

998
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,280
What is it?

999
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,280
Amazing.

1000
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,280
Are you going to take a shower again?

1001
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Just a little.

1002
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,280
Just a little?

1003
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,280
What?

1004
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,280
What?

1005
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,280
What?

1006
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,280
What?

1007
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,280
What are you doing?

1008
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,280
What are you doing?

1009
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,280
I want to kiss you.

1010
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,280
Kiss?

1011
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,280
It's embarrassing.

1012
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,280
What?

1013
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,280
What?

1014
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,280
What?

1015
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,280
It's hot.

1016
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,280
You're standing on your own.

1017
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,280
I'm sleepy.

1018
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,280
No, I can't.

1019
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,280
It's too early. You're already trying to lick it.

1020
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,280
Just line up your butt.

1021
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,280
Is it good?

1022
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,280
Is it good?

1023
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,280
Close your eyes.

1024
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,280
What is it?

1025
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,280
I'm enjoying my kiss.

1026
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,280
Ah!

1027
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,280
I can't see.

1028
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,280
I'm pulling out my nails.

1029
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,280
I want it.

1030
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,280
Eat it.

1031
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,280
Do you like it?

1032
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,280
No

1033
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,280
Both of you are doing great

1034
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,280
Because

1035
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,280
Do you feel good?

1036
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,280
Yes

1037
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,280
Serina is relaxed

1038
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:55,280
He is very serious.

1039
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,280
He is pulling the string.

1040
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,280
He is pulling the string.

1041
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,280
What are you doing?

1042
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,280
He is licking.

1043
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,280
Do you want to wet yourself?

1044
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,280
I can see that they are licking each other a lot.

1045
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,280
I can see that they are licking each other a lot.

1046
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,280
Let me see.

1047
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,280
Let me touch you a little bit more.

1048
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,280
Really?

1049
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,280
Let me touch you a little bit more.

1050
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,280
Let me touch you a little bit more.

1051
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,280
Wow, you're touching me.

1052
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,280
Wow, you're touching me.

1053
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,280
Wow, you're touching me.

1054
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,280
Wow, you're touching me.

1055
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,280
You're trying to do something great.

1056
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,280
What?

1057
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,280
What? I can't see you.

1058
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,280
I can't see you.

1059
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,280
I want to eat it.

1060
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,280
What are you doing?

1061
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,280
I want to eat it.

1062
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,280
It's delicious.

1063
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,280
I want to eat it.

1064
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,280
Cool, cool.

1065
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,280
It's amazing.

1066
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,280
Sumire, you should learn this technique.

1067
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,280
I'm not doing anything.

1068
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,280
I'm sorry.

1069
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,280
I'm sorry.

1070
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,280
I'm sorry.

1071
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,280
I'm sorry.

1072
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,280
Cheers.

1073
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,280
Your hands stink.

1074
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,280
Really?

1075
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,280
Your hands stink.

1076
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,280
What are you doing?

1077
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,280
What are you doing?

1078
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,280
You always do this.

1079
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,280
You always do this.

1080
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,280
You always do this.

1081
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,280
What is it?

1082
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,280
What is it?

1083
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,280
I don't know.

1084
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,280
His voice was pleasant.

1085
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,280
Yes.

1086
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,280
That's what I thought.

1087
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:02,280
Why do you always move like this?

1088
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,280
Are you licking me?

1089
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,280
You are moving a lot.

1090
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,280
Look at her.

1091
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,280
Look at her.

1092
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Look at her.

1093
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,280
Huh?

1094
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,280
What are you talking about?

1095
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,280
I told you to lick it.

1096
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,280
Let's learn, let's learn.

1097
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,280
There's no such thing.

1098
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,280
You're the best.

1099
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,280
Wow!

1100
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,280
I can remember it right away.

1101
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,280
Don't you want to compare the two?

1102
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,280
What?

1103
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,280
It's embarrassing.

1104
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,280
Let's go to the bed.

1105
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,280
Over there?

1106
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,280
It's a round table.

1107
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,280
Turn your back to me.

1108
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,280
In such a bright place.

1109
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,280
Open it yourself.

1110
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,280
It's a plate.

1111
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,280
It's a plate.

1112
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,280
It's not embarrassing to sleep on the stone.

1113
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,280
Like this?

1114
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:42,280
I can't lose to you.

1115
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,280
It's difficult.

1116
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,280
Can you do both hands?

1117
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,280
Both hands?

1118
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,280
I'm embarrassed.

1119
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,280
It's a shame.

1120
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,280
It's great.

1121
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,280
Can't you cancel the flight?

1122
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,280
What are you talking about?

1123
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,280
What?

1124
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,280
You thought it was good, didn't you?

1125
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,280
No, it's true.

1126
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,280
Forgive me.

1127
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,280
It's very beautiful.

1128
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,280
It's very wet.

1129
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,280
It's wet, isn't it?

1130
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,280
It's embarrassing.

1131
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,280
Why is it so wet?

1132
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,280
No, don't do it.

1133
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,280
Oh, it feels good.

1134
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,280
Oh, no.

1135
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,280
Are you breathing?

1136
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,280
Why?

1137
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,280
No.

1138
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,280
Stop it.

1139
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,280
1,2,3

1140
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,280
It's embarrassing

1141
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:26,280
It's a little hard to tell

1142
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,280
This

1143
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,280
Huh?

1144
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,280
Is it this?

1145
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,280
The one on the top

1146
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,280
Do you like it?

1147
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,280
Is it this?

1148
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,280
Yeah

1149
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,280
I'm embarrassed

1150
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:56,280
What do you want to do?

1151
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,280
What do you want to do?

1152
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,280
It's embarrassing.

1153
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:06,280
It's a wet tissue.

1154
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:12,280
What do you want to do?

1155
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,280
What are you doing?

1156
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,280
I can't go.

1157
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,280
What are you doing?

1158
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,280
What are you doing?

1159
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,280
What are you doing?

1160
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,280
What is he doing?

1161
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,280
Did he go inside?

1162
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,280
I'm sorry.

1163
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,280
I was looking forward to it.

1164
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,280
Look at this.

1165
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,280
Amazing.

1166
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,280
Is this your body?

1167
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,280
I'm sorry.

1168
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,280
I'm sorry.

1169
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,280
I'm sorry.

1170
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,280
I'm sorry.

1171
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:28,280
It's a little weird.

1172
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,280
It's a little weird.

1173
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,280
It's amazing.

1174
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,280
It's a little weird.

1175
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,280
It's licking here.

1176
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:47,280
It's amazing.

1177
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,280
It feels good.

1178
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,280
It feels good.

1179
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,280
Wow.

1180
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,280
Shacho.

1181
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,280
What are you enjoying?

1182
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,280
What?

1183
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,280
Nothing.

1184
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,280
I see.

1185
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,280
I'll pet you.

1186
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,280
You can't take it out.

1187
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,280
What should I do?

1188
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,280
I'm going to use this.

1189
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:26,280
What is it?

1190
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,280
It looks lonely.

1191
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,280
It looks lonely.

1192
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,280
It feels good.

1193
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,280
What are you doing?

1194
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,280
It feels good.

1195
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,280
It feels good.

1196
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,280
I'm so tired.

1197
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,280
I feel so good.

1198
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,280
I'm so tired.

1199
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,280
I'm so tired.

1200
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,280
I can't believe it.

1201
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,280
It feels so good.

1202
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,280
I can't believe it.

1203
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,280
I can't believe it.

1204
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,280
It feels so good.

1205
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,280
It's so hard.

1206
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,280
It feels so good.

1207
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,280
Wait.

1208
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,280
I'm scared.

1209
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,280
I'm going.

1210
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,280
I'm going.

1211
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,280
I'm scared.

1212
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,280
You're sweating.

1213
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,280
Amazing.

1214
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,280
You are really doing it.

1215
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,280
Do you like it?

1216
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,280
I like black

1217
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,280
I was surprised.

1218
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,280
It's amazing.

1219
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,280
I don't know if I can do it.

1220
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,280
Let's try again.

1221
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,280
I feel so good.

1222
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,280
Amazing.

1223
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,280
I feel so good.

1224
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:56,280
I feel so good.

1225
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:00,280
I am about to cry.

1226
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:04,280
I am scared.

1227
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:08,280
It's cold.

1228
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:12,280
I am scared.

1229
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,280
I am scared.

1230
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:20,280
Go.

1231
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:24,280
I am scared.

1232
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,280
I'm going to put it on me.

1233
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,280
I'm going to put it on you.

1234
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,280
I'm going to put it on you.

1235
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,280
Wow, that's amazing.

1236
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,280
You were shaking your hips a lot.

1237
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,280
I was shaking like that?

1238
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,280
Don't you feel like a wife?

1239
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,280
Oh, no.

1240
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,280
Oh, that's not it.

1241
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,280
That's not it.

1242
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:25,280
It feels so good.

1243
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,280
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

1244
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,280
It's all over the place.

1245
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,280
You're so kind.

1246
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,280
Study hard.

1247
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,280
It's cold.

1248
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,280
Almiya Etci.

1249
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,280
Oh, it feels good.

1250
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:56,280
Her hip is moving.

1251
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:58,280
Can you do this?

1252
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:00,280
I can't.

1253
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,280
Really?

1254
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,280
Oh, great.

1255
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,280
Her hip is moving.

1256
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,280
Watch carefully.

1257
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,280
Oh, my!

1258
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,280
Oh, my!

1259
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,280
Please, help me!

1260
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,280
Show me.

1261
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,280
Show me.

1262
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:34,280
Show me.

1263
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,280
Show me.

1264
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,280
I want to touch your butt.

1265
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,280
It feels good.

1266
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,280
Can you touch it?

1267
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,280
I can't touch it.

1268
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:28,280
Can you touch it?

1269
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,280
Amazing.

1270
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,280
It tickles!

1271
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,280
How is it?

1272
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,280
Can I touch it?

1273
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,280
No, you can't.

1274
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,280
Does it tickle?

1275
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:50,280
Amazing!

1276
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,280
There are a lot of itchiness.

1277
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,280
Here?

1278
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:00,280
Wow, it's so messy.

1279
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,280
It feels so good.

1280
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,280
It feels so good.

1281
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,280
I feel like I'm going to fall into a pool.

1282
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,280
I'm tired.

1283
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,280
Let's go.

1284
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,280
Next to me.

1285
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:32,280
Next to me?

1286
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:33,280
Yes.

1287
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,280
Are you ready?

1288
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,280
Come on.

1289
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,280
I'm tired.

1290
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,280
I'm here!!

1291
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,280
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.

1292
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,280
Me too.

1293
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,280
Me too.

1294
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,280
Me too.

1295
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,280
Me too.

1296
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,280
Me too.

1297
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,280
Me too.

1298
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,280
Me too.

1299
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,280
Me too.

1300
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:39,280
Me too.

1301
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,280
Me too.

1302
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,280
Me too.

1303
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,280
I'm so nervous.

1304
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,280
I'm so nervous.

1305
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,280
Are you okay?

1306
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,280
I'm so nervous.

1307
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,280
I'm so nervous.

1308
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:09,280
Oh, it feels good.

1309
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,280
Oh, I can do it.

1310
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,280
Oh, I'm nervous.

1311
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:26,280
Oh, did you go in?

1312
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,280
Are you okay?

1313
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,280
How many times did you go out?

1314
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,280
I'm getting goosebumps.

1315
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,280
I'm so happy.

1316
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,280
Are you in pain?

1317
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:44,280
Oh, no.

1318
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:46,280
It's because you're in pain.

1319
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:48,280
Well, that's true.

1320
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:56,280
I'm getting a lot of pain.

1321
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,280
I'm so happy.

1322
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:00,280
I feel so good

1323
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,280
I feel so good

1324
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,280
I feel so good

1325
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,280
I feel so good

1326
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,280
I'm going to go

1327
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:25,280
Give me a good one!

1328
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,280
Ouch!

1329
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,280
Wow!

1330
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,280
Did you get hurt?

1331
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,280
I'm so tired.

1332
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,280
I'm so tired today.

1333
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:54,280
I'm so tired.

1334
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,280
Did you take it out?

1335
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,280
Did you take it out?

1336
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,280
Did you really take it out?

1337
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,280
This is bad.

1338
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,280
Well, it's okay.

1339
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,280
It's not good.

1340
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,280
I feel good.

1341
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,280
Is the time okay?

1342
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,280
The time is okay.

1343
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,280
Can you do it again?

1344
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,280
It's amazing.

1345
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,280
It's amazing. I can still do it.

1346
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,280
Even though I just did it.

1347
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,280
No, no.

1348
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,280
It feels good.

1349
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,280
Wait.

1350
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,280
It feels good.

1351
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,280
It's okay, it's okay.

1352
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,280
It's okay, it's okay.

1353
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,280
One more time.

1354
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,280
Amazing.

1355
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,280
Ah!

1356
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,280
Ah!

1357
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,280
Ah!

1358
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,280
Ah!

1359
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,280
Ah!

1360
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,280
Ah!

1361
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,280
What happened to everyone?

1362
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,280
Ah!

1363
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,280
Ah!

1364
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,280
Ah!

1365
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,280
Ah!

1366
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,280
Ah!

1367
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,280
Ah!

1368
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,280
Ah!

1369
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,280
I'm so tired.

1370
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,280
What's wrong?

1371
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,280
I'm so tired.

1372
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,280
I'm so tired.

1373
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:34,280
I can't do it. It feels so good.

1374
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,280
Aaaaaah!

1375
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,280
It's too painful!

1376
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,280
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

1377
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,280
Ah, ah, ah!

1378
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,280
Ah, ah, ah!

1379
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,280
I'm going!

1380
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,280
Uh, uh, ah!

1381
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,280
Ah, ah, ah!

1382
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,280
Ah!

1383
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,280
Ah!

1384
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,280
Ah!

1385
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,280
Ah, it's painful!

1386
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,280
Ah, ah!

1387
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,280
Ah, ah, ah!

1388
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,280
I'm so tired.

1389
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,280
Look at me.

1390
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,280
Look at me.

1391
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,280
Please help me.

1392
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,280
You are too small.

1393
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,280
I'm not.

1394
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:16,280
You are too small.

1395
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:18,280
You are too small.

1396
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,280
Look.

1397
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,280
It's amazing.

1398
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:30,280
It's a little bit.

1399
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,280
I can't do it anymore.

1400
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:36,280
I'm getting semen.

1401
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,280
I can't do it anymore.

1402
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,280
I can't do it anymore.

1403
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:56,280
It feels good.

1404
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:05,280
It's really hard.

1405
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,280
Oh, no.

1406
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,280
I'm going to die.

1407
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,280
Are you OK?

1408
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,280
I'm so tired.

1409
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,280
I'm so tired.

1410
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,280
I'm so tired.

1411
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,280
I'm so tired.

1412
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,280
No way.

1413
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:37,280
Are you okay?

1414
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,280
Ah, it's so cold.

1415
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,280
Did you put it out?

1416
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,280
Did you put it out for Riri-chan too?

1417
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,280
I put it out.

1418
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:59,280
You put it out for a crazy person's wife?

1419
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,280
It's so messy.

1420
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:04,280
I was so scared.

1421
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,280
Is it okay?

1422
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,280
I feel like I did something wrong.

1423
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,280
I'm sorry.

1424
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:28,280
I can't do it anymore.

1425
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,280
It's gross.

1426
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:39,280
I can't do it anymore.

1427
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,280
Stop it.

1428
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:47,280
Ouch!

1429
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,280
I can't do it anymore.

1430
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,280
This is too much.

1431
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,280
This is Sen-chan's.

1432
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,280
I'm sorry.

1433
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,280
I'm sorry.

1434
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,280
Oh my god.

1435
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,280
It's amazing.

1436
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,280
It's coming out.

1437
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,280
Both of you are amazing.

1438
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,280
It's the second time.

1439
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:18,280
Amazing.

1440
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:24,280
Wow, it's so strong.

1441
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,280
It's still warm.

1442
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:36,280
It's amazing.

1443
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,280
I don't have much time left.

1444
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:49,280
I'm glad I was able to do it before I left.

1445
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:07,280
I have to go to the airport.

1446
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:11,280
I'm going to go home now.

1447
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,280
You should rest a little.

1448
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:16,280
I have to hurry.

1449
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:18,280
It's good.

1450
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:20,280
Yes, it's good.

1451
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,280
It's good.
