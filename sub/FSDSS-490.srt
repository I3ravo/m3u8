1
0.00 --> 4.00
 We're done with our date.

2
4.00 --> 6.00
 We're done.

3
6.00 --> 8.00
 It's kind of sad to go home.

4
8.00 --> 10.00
 Yeah.

5
10.00 --> 12.00
 It was fun.

6
12.00 --> 16.00
 The more fun it is, the sadder it gets when we go home.

7
16.00 --> 24.11
 It was good. I'm full.

8
24.11 --> 30.30
 What should we do next?

9
30.30 --> 32.30
 How about Italian?

10
32.30 --> 34.30
 Italian sounds good.

11
34.30 --> 39.47
 Italian sounds good.

12
40.47 --> 42.47
 It's kind of sad to go home.

13
42.47 --> 44.47
 Yeah.

14
51.62 --> 53.62
 Two days in a row?

15
53.62 --> 57.58
 Yeah.

16
57.58 --> 59.58
 What?

17
59.58 --> 65.77
 What did you say?

18
65.77 --> 67.77
 What did you say?

19
67.77 --> 69.77
 Amore.

20
69.77 --> 71.77
 What amore?

21
71.77 --> 73.77
 Amore.

22
73.77 --> 75.77
 Amore.

23
75.77 --> 77.77
 Amore?

24
77.77 --> 81.59
 No.

25
81.59 --> 83.59
 Sit down?

26
83.59 --> 85.59
 No.

27
85.59 --> 87.59
 Stay over.

28
87.59 --> 89.59
 Stay over? Is that okay?

29
89.59 --> 91.59
 Yeah.

30
91.59 --> 93.59
 Let's do it.

31
93.59 --> 95.59
 Okay. I want to stay over.

32
95.59 --> 97.59
 Let's do it.

33
97.59 --> 99.59
 Shall we?

34
99.59 --> 101.59
 What about the next day?

35
101.59 --> 106.82
 It's okay.

36
106.82 --> 112.70
 Can I go home?

37
112.70 --> 116.20
 Yay.

38
116.20 --> 118.20
 Then I'll clean your room.

39
118.20 --> 120.20
 I'll clean your room.

40
120.20 --> 122.20
 It's okay. I want to drink it as it is.

41
122.20 --> 124.20
 It's not that dirty.

42
124.20 --> 126.20
 It's pretty dirty.

43
126.20 --> 128.20
 I'll clean your room.

44
128.20 --> 130.20
 Okay.

45
134.20 --> 136.20
 Let's cook something.

46
136.20 --> 138.20
 Can you cook?

47
138.20 --> 140.20
 I can.

48
140.20 --> 143.77
 Let's ask her to cook.

49
143.77 --> 157.00
 Okay.

50
157.00 --> 159.00
 Are you nervous?

51
159.00 --> 161.00
 Are you looking forward to it?

52
161.00 --> 163.00
 I'm looking forward to it.

53
163.00 --> 165.00
 Then,

54
165.00 --> 167.00
 let's meet

55
167.00 --> 169.00
 at the next stay.

56
169.00 --> 171.00
 Let's meet.

57
171.00 --> 173.00
 Thank you for today.

58
173.00 --> 175.00
 Thank you. Take care.

59
177.00 --> 179.00
 You have to go home by train, right?

60
179.00 --> 181.00
 Yeah.

61
181.00 --> 183.00
 Then,

62
183.00 --> 205.64
 take care.

63
206.64 --> 215.58
 Hello.

64
215.58 --> 217.58
 Hello.

65
217.58 --> 219.58
 It's been a while.

66
219.58 --> 221.58
 It's like summer.

67
221.58 --> 223.58
 It looks cool.

68
223.58 --> 225.58
 It's like a service station.

69
225.58 --> 227.58
 Because there is a camera.

70
227.58 --> 232.56
 Because there is a camera.

71
232.56 --> 234.56
 Hello.

72
234.56 --> 241.46
 It's hot.

73
241.46 --> 243.46
 Do you want to drink tea?

74
243.46 --> 247.79
 Yeah.

75
247.79 --> 249.79
 Let's go to that cafe.

76
249.79 --> 253.23
 Terrace.

77
253.23 --> 255.23
 Is it okay?

78
255.23 --> 257.23
 Let's buy something.

79
257.23 --> 259.23
 Okay.

80
259.23 --> 261.23
 It's hot.

81
261.23 --> 263.23
 I want to drink melon cream soda.

82
263.23 --> 265.23
 Melon cream soda.

83
265.23 --> 267.23
 It has ice cream on it.

84
267.23 --> 269.23
 Let's go.

85
269.23 --> 271.23
 Let's go.

86
271.23 --> 278.58
 Now,

87
278.58 --> 280.58
 she bought it for me.

88
284.58 --> 291.22
 How do I dress up?

89
291.22 --> 293.22
 I'm talking to myself.

90
293.22 --> 295.22
 Like this.

91
295.22 --> 297.22
 Can you see me?

92
297.22 --> 299.22
 I'm wearing an off-shoulder dress.

93
299.22 --> 306.30
 Oh,

94
306.30 --> 308.30
 I'm here.

95
308.30 --> 310.30
 What are we going to do today?

96
310.30 --> 312.30
 What are we going to do?

97
312.30 --> 314.30
 How about dinner?

98
314.30 --> 316.30
 Dinner?

99
316.30 --> 318.30
 What do you want?

100
318.30 --> 320.30
 What do you like?

101
320.30 --> 322.30
 What do you want me to make?

102
322.30 --> 324.30
 Is it okay if it's simple?

103
324.30 --> 326.30
 What is it?

104
326.30 --> 328.30
 Curry.

105
328.30 --> 330.30
 I got it.

106
330.30 --> 332.30
 I'll make curry.

107
332.30 --> 334.30
 How spicy is it?

108
336.30 --> 338.30
 Sweet or spicy?

109
338.30 --> 340.30
 Can I choose?

110
340.30 --> 342.30
 You can choose anything.

111
342.30 --> 344.30
 I'll make it spicy.

112
344.30 --> 346.30
 How spicy is it?

113
346.30 --> 348.30
 How spicy is it?

114
348.30 --> 350.30
 Is it spicy?

115
350.30 --> 352.30
 It's sweet.

116
352.30 --> 354.30
 Is it sweet?

117
354.30 --> 356.30
 It's spicy.

118
358.30 --> 360.30
 It's spicy.

119
360.30 --> 362.30
 Then,

120
362.30 --> 364.30
 I'll make it spicy.

121
366.30 --> 368.30
 I'll make it spicy.

122
368.30 --> 370.30
 Okay.

123
370.30 --> 372.30
 Don't you recommend it?

124
374.30 --> 376.30
 It's spicy,

125
376.30 --> 378.30
 but it's good for summer.

126
378.30 --> 380.30
 Sweat a lot in summer.

127
380.30 --> 382.30
 I'll make curry.

128
382.30 --> 384.30
 I'll make curry.

129
384.30 --> 386.30
 Okay.

130
386.30 --> 389.81
 Ta-da!

131
389.81 --> 391.81
 It's melon.

132
391.81 --> 393.81
 It's Hokkaido melon juice.

133
393.81 --> 395.81
 It's Hokkaido melon juice.

134
395.81 --> 397.81
 Is it?

135
397.81 --> 399.81
 It's luxurious.

136
399.81 --> 401.81
 It's perfect for summer.

137
401.81 --> 409.70
 Cheers!

138
411.70 --> 413.70
 It looks good.

139
413.70 --> 415.70
 Please give me food review.

140
415.70 --> 420.70
 Wow, look at this melon soda!

141
420.70 --> 426.70
 It's a melon soda with an old-fashioned atmosphere.

142
426.70 --> 429.70
 There are also cherry blossoms on it.

143
429.70 --> 431.70
 I'd like to drink it right away.

144
436.65 --> 439.65
 The sweetness of the melon and...

145
440.65 --> 441.65
 It's a little different.

146
441.65 --> 442.65
 Melon!

147
442.65 --> 444.65
 Does melon have acidity?

148
444.65 --> 445.65
 Yes, it does.

149
445.65 --> 451.65
 The balance of the acidity and sweetness of the melon is just right.

150
451.65 --> 456.65
 The ice cream on top melts and mixes with the melon soda.

151
457.65 --> 460.65
 It has a mild flavor.

152
460.65 --> 463.65
 It's a perfect drink for summer.

153
465.65 --> 466.65
 Disqualified!

154
466.65 --> 468.65
 Really?

155
468.65 --> 469.65
 Ice cream?

156
469.65 --> 470.65
 Yes.

157
476.65 --> 477.65
 It's delicious.

158
477.65 --> 478.65
 Is it?

159
478.65 --> 483.65
 Don't you think it's more delicious to have ice cream on top of this than regular ice cream?

160
483.65 --> 484.65
 It's delicious.

161
487.92 --> 489.92
 Where should we go next?

162
492.81 --> 494.81
 Let's go to a flower shop.

163
494.81 --> 495.81
 Flower shop?

164
495.81 --> 496.81
 Let's go.

165
497.81 --> 498.81
 Do you like flowers?

166
498.81 --> 499.81
 Yes, I do.

167
500.81 --> 502.81
 Let's go to a flower shop first.

168
502.81 --> 504.81
 It's dangerous, so let's go this way.

169
504.81 --> 506.81
 You're a gentleman.

170
506.81 --> 507.81
 Do you want me to carry your bag?

171
507.81 --> 508.81
 Are you okay?

172
508.81 --> 509.81
 Thank you.

173
510.81 --> 512.81
 He's a gentleman.

174
524.31 --> 525.31
 I'm not used to it yet.

175
525.31 --> 526.31
 What?

176
526.31 --> 528.31
 Holding hands.

177
528.31 --> 530.31
 I thought you were not used to holding hands.

178
531.31 --> 533.31
 I'm nervous, too.

179
534.31 --> 535.31
 I'm embarrassed.

180
535.31 --> 537.31
 You're not used to it?

181
537.31 --> 538.31
 No.

182
543.31 --> 545.31
 This is the entrance.

183
545.31 --> 547.31
 A flower shop.

184
548.31 --> 549.31
 It's cute.

185
549.31 --> 550.31
 It's blue.

186
551.31 --> 552.31
 It's good.

187
552.31 --> 553.31
 Today's flower.

188
554.31 --> 555.31
 Today's flower.

189
555.31 --> 556.31
 Today's flower.

190
556.31 --> 558.31
 I like sunflower.

191
558.31 --> 560.31
 It looks good on you.

192
560.31 --> 561.31
 Really?

193
567.21 --> 568.21
 It's cool.

194
572.44 --> 573.44
 There are a lot of sunflowers.

195
573.44 --> 575.44
 Do you like sunflower?

196
575.44 --> 576.44
 Yes, I like it.

197
576.44 --> 577.44
 You're already blind.

198
578.44 --> 579.44
 Then, let's buy it.

199
581.44 --> 583.44
 I'm going to buy it, so wait for me.

200
583.44 --> 584.44
 Thank you.

201
584.44 --> 585.44
 Can I take a selfie?

202
585.44 --> 586.44
 Sure.

203
588.44 --> 590.44
 I got a sunflower.

204
591.44 --> 597.38
 It's my favorite sunflower.

205
597.38 --> 599.38
 Look, it's beautiful here.

206
601.38 --> 603.38
 I got a sunflower.

207
603.38 --> 606.90
 Let's go.

208
607.90 --> 608.90
 Let's put it in the room.

209
608.90 --> 609.90
 It's cute.

210
609.90 --> 610.90
 It goes well with curry.

211
610.90 --> 611.90
 It goes well with curry.

212
612.90 --> 613.90
 It's like a festival.

213
618.11 --> 619.11
 I'm going to get it.

214
619.11 --> 620.11
 It's good here.

215
621.11 --> 622.11
 What?

216
622.11 --> 623.11
 It's good.

217
623.11 --> 624.11
 There are a lot of vegetables.

218
624.11 --> 625.11
 Let's go to buy it.

219
625.11 --> 626.11
 Let's go.

220
641.99 --> 642.99
 Onion is 100 yen.

221
642.99 --> 643.99
 Is it cheap?

222
643.99 --> 644.99
 Is it cheap?

223
644.99 --> 645.99
 Yes.

224
645.99 --> 646.99
 Carrot.

225
647.99 --> 648.99
 Curry is carrot.

226
655.99 --> 656.99
 It's for curry.

227
656.99 --> 657.99
 It's for white people.

228
657.99 --> 658.99
 It's for white people.

229
658.99 --> 659.99
 Do you like white people?

230
660.99 --> 661.99
 I like white people, too.

231
661.99 --> 662.99
 Really?

232
663.99 --> 664.99
 How about garlic?

233
664.99 --> 665.99
 Garlic?

234
665.99 --> 666.99
 Do you put garlic in curry?

235
668.99 --> 670.99
 My family put garlic in curry.

236
670.99 --> 671.99
 Really?

237
671.99 --> 673.99
 Do you put garlic in curry?

238
673.99 --> 674.99
 No, I don't.

239
675.99 --> 676.99
 I put it as a snack.

240
676.99 --> 677.99
 Oh, I see.

241
678.99 --> 685.07
 But I'm going to eat a lot today, so I don't think I should eat it.

242
691.58 --> 697.58
 It seems that he likes to put garlic in curry.

243
698.58 --> 702.58
 But I'm going to stay overnight today, so I think I'll kiss him a lot.

244
703.58 --> 708.58
 I think I'll kiss him a lot, so I told him not to put garlic in curry.

245
709.58 --> 716.58
 It seems that he likes spicy curry, so I'll make it spicy.

246
717.58 --> 720.58
 I hope he likes it.

247
720.58 --> 721.58
 Welcome back.

248
728.50 --> 737.97
 I bought a bag, I bought curry, and I drank soda.

249
738.97 --> 740.97
 Today's mission is completed.

250
741.97 --> 743.97
 Let's go home.

251
744.97 --> 745.97
 Bye-bye.

252
760.35 --> 761.35
 Do you need help?

253
761.35 --> 762.35
 No, it's okay.

254
763.35 --> 764.35
 Carrot?

255
764.35 --> 765.35
 Carrot.

256
765.35 --> 766.35
 Good.

257
766.35 --> 767.35
 Do you like carrots?

258
767.35 --> 768.35
 I like carrots.

259
768.35 --> 769.35
 Can you eat it?

260
769.35 --> 771.35
 Then I'll cut a lot.

261
771.35 --> 772.35
 It's nutritious.

262
772.35 --> 773.35
 Yes, it's important.

263
775.35 --> 776.35
 I'll put a lot of summer vegetables.

264
777.35 --> 779.35
 Do you put a lot of carrots?

265
779.35 --> 781.35
 Aren't they summer vegetables?

266
782.35 --> 783.35
 No, they aren't.

267
784.35 --> 785.35
 They aren't.

268
785.35 --> 787.35
 Are there any summer vegetables in curry?

269
787.35 --> 788.35
 I don't think so.

270
788.35 --> 789.35
 Like Nasubi.

271
789.35 --> 790.35
 I see.

272
790.35 --> 792.35
 I'm putting a lot of it.

273
793.35 --> 794.35
 Can I watch it?

274
795.35 --> 796.35
 Yes, you can.

275
797.35 --> 798.35
 Do you want to watch it?

276
798.35 --> 802.35
 I'm so happy to see you here.

277
802.35 --> 804.35
 Is that so?

278
804.35 --> 806.35
 It's like a special guest.

279
806.35 --> 808.35
 Special guest?

280
808.35 --> 810.35
 It's good to watch TV.

281
810.35 --> 812.35
 TV?

282
812.35 --> 814.35
 This is better than TV.

283
814.35 --> 816.35
 Really?

284
820.35 --> 824.35
 I can't concentrate when I see someone else.

285
824.35 --> 826.35
 Did you lose your concentration?

286
826.35 --> 828.35
 Yes.

287
828.35 --> 830.35
 I get nervous when I'm watched.

288
830.35 --> 832.35
 Really?

289
832.35 --> 834.35
 I get nervous every day.

290
834.35 --> 836.35
 I get injured.

291
836.35 --> 838.35
 I see.

292
838.35 --> 840.35
 It's better not to watch TV.

293
840.35 --> 842.35
 If you get injured.

294
844.35 --> 846.35
 I get nervous.

295
846.35 --> 848.35
 Do you?

296
848.35 --> 850.35
 Especially when I'm alone at home.

297
850.35 --> 852.35
 I'm a little nervous.

298
852.35 --> 854.35
 But we're finally together.

299
854.35 --> 856.35
 The two of us.

300
856.35 --> 858.35
 That's right.

301
858.35 --> 861.73
 It's our first time at home.

302
861.73 --> 863.73
 It's good.

303
865.73 --> 867.73
 I'm so happy.

304
869.73 --> 871.73
 Do you want to kiss me?

305
873.73 --> 875.73
 I'm not ready.

306
875.73 --> 877.73
 Why?

307
877.73 --> 879.73
 I'm not ready.

308
879.73 --> 881.73
 Why?

309
881.73 --> 883.73
 I'm nervous.

310
883.73 --> 885.73
 Do you want to kiss me?

311
885.73 --> 889.49
 Yes.

312
889.49 --> 891.49
 What should I do?

313
939.71 --> 941.71
 You're not hungry yet, are you?

314
941.71 --> 943.71
 Not really.

315
943.71 --> 945.71
 Then you don't have to make curry yet.

316
945.71 --> 947.71
 No.

317
947.71 --> 949.71
 I can take my time.

318
949.71 --> 951.71
 Really?

319
951.71 --> 953.71
 Do you want to make more?

320
953.71 --> 1019.84
 Yes.

321
1021.84 --> 1044.03
 I'm a little nervous.

322
1044.03 --> 1046.03
 Are you nervous?

323
1046.03 --> 1048.03
 Why?

324
1048.03 --> 1050.03
 It's been a long time.

325
1050.03 --> 1052.03
 It's been a long time?

326
1052.03 --> 1054.03
 Yes.

327
1054.03 --> 1056.03
 How long?

328
1056.03 --> 1058.03
 One year.

329
1058.03 --> 1060.03
 One year?

330
1060.03 --> 1062.03
 Don't you remember how to do it?

331
1064.03 --> 1066.03
 Sometimes I forget.

332
1066.03 --> 1110.82
 Really?

333
1110.82 --> 1119.38
 Yes.

334
1123.38 --> 1125.38
 I thought it was good to wear clothes.

335
1125.38 --> 1127.38
 But it's not good to take it off.

336
1127.38 --> 1129.38
 What?

337
1129.38 --> 1131.38
 Don't look at me like that.

338
1136.10 --> 1138.10
 What?

339
1148.30 --> 1152.64
 I love you.

340
1152.64 --> 1173.07
 I love you too.

341
1173.07 --> 1178.11
 I love you too.

342
1178.11 --> 1180.11
 I'll kiss you from behind.

343
1180.11 --> 1182.11
 From behind?

344
1182.11 --> 1187.92
 Like this?

345
1388.70 --> 1390.70
 I'm nervous.

346
1390.70 --> 1395.17
 I'm nervous.

347
1402.83 --> 1404.83
 I'm nervous.

348
1416.40 --> 1418.40
 Don't look at me like that.

349
1424.85 --> 1426.85
 Don't look at me like that.

350
1433.12 --> 1437.39
 Just a little.

351
1437.39 --> 1439.39
 Just a little?

352
1557.33 --> 1581.63
 It's my turn.

353
1581.63 --> 1583.63
 What?

354
1583.63 --> 1589.06
 What?

355
1591.06 --> 1593.06
 I'm sweating a lot.

356
1593.06 --> 1595.06
 It's okay.

357
1621.49 --> 1694.62
 I'm embarrassed.

358
1694.62 --> 1705.81
 Are you embarrassed?

359
1720.77 --> 1722.77
 It's okay.

360
1730.30 --> 1732.30
 I'm embarrassed, too.

361
1734.30 --> 1758.10
 Don't look at me like that.

362
1772.22 --> 1777.26
 I'm embarrassed.

363
1883.46 --> 1885.46
 Don't look at me like that.

364
1893.46 --> 1901.95
 It's big.

365
1937.07 --> 1959.81
 It's big.

366
2080.88 --> 2082.88
 It's big.

367
2084.88 --> 2086.88
 I'll kiss you.

368
2088.88 --> 2090.88
 It's big.

369
2113.78 --> 2115.78
 Don't look at me like that.

370
2246.69 --> 2248.69
 Don't look at me like that.

371
2456.56 --> 2460.26
 It's big.

372
2553.31 --> 2555.31
 It's big.

373
2555.31 --> 2557.31
 I have to move a little.

374
2609.66 --> 2626.67
 It's big.

375
2840.30 --> 2842.30
 I'm going to have a stomachache.

376
2842.30 --> 2844.30
 I'm going to have a stomachache.

377
2875.09 --> 2877.09
 I'm going to have a stomachache.

378
2913.84 --> 2915.84
 I have to make curry.

379
2915.84 --> 2917.84
 That's right.

380
2917.84 --> 2919.84
 Are you hungry?

381
2919.84 --> 2921.84
 I'm hungry.

382
2943.65 --> 2945.65
 I have to make curry.

383
2947.65 --> 2949.65
 Are you hungry?

384
2949.65 --> 2951.65
 I worked out.

385
2951.65 --> 2958.70
 I have to make curry.

386
2995.10 --> 2997.10
 It's cold.

387
2999.10 --> 3001.10
 It's cold, isn't it?

388
3001.10 --> 3003.10
 It's cold, isn't it?

389
3007.10 --> 3009.10
 Are you okay?

390
3009.10 --> 3011.10
 You can do it.

391
3011.10 --> 3013.10
 You can do it.

392
3013.10 --> 3015.10
 You can do it.

393
3015.10 --> 3017.10
 I'll give you a bath.

394
3017.10 --> 3019.10
 Thank you.

395
3019.10 --> 3046.99
 I'll give you a bath.

396
3046.99 --> 3048.99
 I'll give you a bath.

397
3096.02 --> 3098.02
 You're healthy again.

398
3098.02 --> 3100.02
 You're healthy again.

399
3102.02 --> 3104.02
 You'll be healthy soon.

400
3186.08 --> 3188.08
 It's warm.

401
3188.08 --> 3190.08
 It's warm.

402
3190.08 --> 3192.08
 You can do it.

403
3192.08 --> 3215.36
 You can do it.

404
3215.36 --> 3220.36
 I was watching you a lot a while ago.

405
3220.36 --> 3249.94
 What?

406
3249.94 --> 3250.94
 I was watching you a lot.

407
3250.94 --> 3269.87
 Did I hurt you?

408
3269.87 --> 3270.87
 No, I didn't.

409
3270.87 --> 3275.04
 I'm glad.

410
3280.93 --> 3282.93
 You smell good.

411
3287.93 --> 3294.86
 I'm going to eat rice.

412
3329.94 --> 3340.80
 I'm going to eat rice.

413
3348.85 --> 3350.85
 That's amazing.

414
3358.80 --> 3361.80
 Do you like being petted?

415
3361.80 --> 3362.80
 Yes.

416
3365.80 --> 3383.51
 It's not painful anymore.

417
3383.51 --> 3384.51
 Really?

418
3384.51 --> 3385.51
 Yes.

419
3385.51 --> 3388.72
 I'm glad.

420
3427.13 --> 3429.13
 Have you ever been petted?

421
3429.13 --> 3430.13
 No, I haven't.

422
3430.13 --> 3431.13
 You haven't?

423
3431.13 --> 3432.13
 No, I haven't.

424
3432.13 --> 3433.13
 That's amazing.

425
3433.13 --> 3436.13
 I'm going to pet you for the first time.

426
3444.87 --> 3446.87
 That's amazing.

427
3446.87 --> 3447.87
 Is it good?

428
3447.87 --> 3448.87
 Does it feel good?

429
3451.44 --> 3458.80
 I'm going to lick you because you have a nipple.

430
3515.94 --> 3550.31
 Does it feel good?

431
3550.31 --> 3551.31
 Yes.

432
3551.31 --> 3553.62
 Does it tickle?

433
3553.62 --> 3555.62
 It tickles.

434
3557.62 --> 3563.11
 It tickles all over.

435
3564.11 --> 3566.11
 You like everything.

436
3567.11 --> 3647.54
 I'm going to lick you.

437
3666.85 --> 3667.85
 That's amazing.

438
3667.85 --> 3669.85
 You have a lot of hair on your head.

439
3671.85 --> 3673.85
 That's amazing.

440
3676.85 --> 3680.61
 You have a lot of hair on your head.

441
3680.61 --> 3682.61
 You look beautiful again.

442
3683.61 --> 3685.61
 Isn't it bad?

443
3685.61 --> 3707.29
 I'm going to lick you.

444
3709.29 --> 3710.29
 That's amazing.

445
3710.29 --> 3713.86
 I've never done this before.

446
3713.86 --> 3716.86
 How did you feel when I petted you for the first time?

447
3716.86 --> 3717.86
 I didn't feel good.

448
3717.86 --> 3718.86
 Really?

449
3724.66 --> 3726.66
 I'm going to wash my body again.

450
3733.54 --> 3734.54
 Thank you for waiting.

451
3734.54 --> 3735.54
 Let's eat.

452
3735.54 --> 3737.54
 Let's eat.

453
3737.54 --> 3739.54
 It looks delicious.

454
3740.54 --> 3742.54
 Is it spicy?

455
3742.54 --> 3744.54
 Is it spicy?

456
3744.54 --> 3745.54
 Try it.

457
3745.54 --> 3746.54
 This is the carrot.

458
3746.54 --> 3747.54
 That's right.

459
3747.54 --> 3749.54
 I put a lot in it.

460
3749.54 --> 3750.54
 Let's eat.

461
3754.54 --> 3756.54
 Did you really taste it?

462
3756.54 --> 3758.54
 Did you really taste it?

463
3759.54 --> 3760.54
 Is it good?

464
3760.54 --> 3761.54
 Is it spicy?

465
3764.54 --> 3765.54
 Is it good?

466
3765.54 --> 3766.54
 Really?

467
3766.54 --> 3767.54
 Let's try it.

468
3767.54 --> 3768.54
 It's spicy.

469
3768.54 --> 3769.54
 It's spicy.

470
3769.54 --> 3770.54
 Is it good?

471
3770.54 --> 3771.54
 It's good.

472
3771.54 --> 3783.01
 Let's eat.

473
3783.01 --> 3784.01
 Isn't it a good level of spiciness?

474
3784.01 --> 3785.01
 Is it spicy?

475
3787.01 --> 3788.01
 It's spicy.

476
3788.01 --> 3789.01
 It's about level 7.

477
3789.01 --> 3790.01
 It's just right.

478
3790.01 --> 3792.01
 I'm glad.

479
3793.01 --> 3794.01
 It's delicious.

480
3794.01 --> 3795.01
 Let's eat the carrot.

481
3795.01 --> 3796.01
 Did you eat the carrot?

482
3796.01 --> 3797.01
 I did.

483
3797.01 --> 3798.01
 This is not a carrot.

484
3798.01 --> 3799.01
 It's a potato.

485
3800.01 --> 3801.01
 Do you want to try it?

486
3801.01 --> 3802.01
 I'm going to give it to you.

487
3808.96 --> 3809.96
 The carrot is soft.

488
3809.96 --> 3810.96
 Is it hard?

489
3810.96 --> 3811.96
 Is it just right?

490
3811.96 --> 3812.96
 It's a little hard.

491
3812.96 --> 3813.96
 Are you kidding me?

492
3813.96 --> 3814.96
 It's all right.

493
3820.49 --> 3821.49
 The texture is good.

494
3822.49 --> 3823.49
 The carrot.

495
3823.49 --> 3824.49
 To put it nicely,

496
3824.49 --> 3826.49
 The carrot has a good texture.

497
3828.49 --> 3829.49
 I think it was a little early.

498
3830.49 --> 3832.49
 It's time to stir-fry.

499
3833.49 --> 3835.49
 Please give me a refill.

500
3838.49 --> 3845.41
 It's delicious.

501
3846.41 --> 3849.30
 It's good.

502
3849.30 --> 3850.30
 I'm getting a little drunk.

503
3854.30 --> 3855.30
 It was hot today.

504
3858.30 --> 3859.30
 I'm tired.

505
3859.30 --> 3861.30
 It's good to drink green tea after eating.

506
3862.30 --> 3863.30
 It's delicious.

507
3864.30 --> 3868.30
 We haven't had a lot of drinks together, have we?

508
3868.30 --> 3869.30
 That's right.

509
3914.03 --> 3915.03
 I took a bath.

510
3916.03 --> 3917.03
 I see.

511
3917.03 --> 3918.03
 It's good.

512
3919.03 --> 3991.42
 It's good, isn't it?

513
3992.42 --> 3993.42
 Let's do the same thing.

514
3993.42 --> 3994.42
 Why?

515
4012.05 --> 4013.05
 Why?

516
4017.55 --> 4018.55
 Will you do it for me?

517
4018.55 --> 4019.55
 What?

518
4019.55 --> 4020.55
 Will you do it for me?

519
4022.55 --> 4025.12
 Do you want me to do it for you?

520
4025.12 --> 4026.12
 Yes.

521
4028.12 --> 4046.18
 It feels good.

522
4147.50 --> 4148.50
 It feels good.

523
4182.02 --> 4188.11
 Do you want to drink more?

524
4188.11 --> 4189.11
 It's hot.

525
4189.11 --> 4190.11
 It's hot, isn't it?

526
4223.28 --> 4224.28
 It feels good.

527
4245.94 --> 4246.94
 I can't stand it.

528
4247.94 --> 4248.94
 I can't stand it.

529
4249.94 --> 4250.94
 Let's go to bed.

530
4250.94 --> 4251.94
 To bed?

531
4556.90 --> 4557.90
 I can't stand it.

532
4685.05 --> 4686.05
 I can't stand it.

533
4701.34 --> 4702.34
 I can't stand it.

534
4864.42 --> 4907.95
 I can't stand it.

535
4913.95 --> 4914.95
 I can't stand it.

536
5151.54 --> 5174.66
 It feels good.

537
5389.26 --> 5390.26
 I can't do it.

538
5390.26 --> 5391.26
 I can't do it.

539
5391.26 --> 5393.26
 I can't do it.

540
5398.77 --> 5400.77
 Ouch!

541
5505.26 --> 5507.26
 I feel like I can sleep a lot.

542
5518.34 --> 5520.34
 It's too early to sleep.

543
5520.34 --> 5522.34
 It's too early to sleep.

544
5522.34 --> 5524.34
 That's right.

545
5524.34 --> 5526.34
 I have to get up.

546
5526.34 --> 5528.34
 I don't want to wake up.

547
5528.34 --> 5530.34
 I don't want to wake up.

548
5978.77 --> 5980.77
 I finally woke up.

549
5980.77 --> 5982.77
 I was sleeping all the time.

550
5982.77 --> 5984.77
 What did you do?

551
5986.77 --> 5988.77
 I touched you and you got bigger.

552
5988.77 --> 5990.77
 Did I get bigger?

553
5992.77 --> 5994.77
 I was surprised.

554
5998.77 --> 6000.77
 Were you really sleeping?

555
6000.77 --> 6002.77
 I was sleeping.

556
6002.77 --> 6004.77
 Really?

557
6006.77 --> 6008.77
 You were reacting.

558
6008.77 --> 6012.27
 I was sleeping.

559
6014.27 --> 6016.27
 I'm sorry.

560
6024.86 --> 6026.86
 Why did you say such a thing?

561
6026.86 --> 6028.86
 I don't want to treat you.

562
6030.86 --> 6032.86
 Do you want me to throw a patchwork at you?

563
6034.86 --> 6056.10
 Good morning Ferra

564
6056.10 --> 6058.10
 Good morning Ferra

565
6058.10 --> 6060.10
 Morning Ferra
