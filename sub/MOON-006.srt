1
2.03 --> 6.03
 In the middle of the night, the light of the moon.

2
6.03 --> 56.13
 Welcome back.

3
59.27 --> 61.27
 You smoked, didn't you?

4
61.27 --> 63.27
 What? No, I didn't.

5
63.27 --> 65.27
 I can smell it.

6
65.27 --> 66.27
 Sorry.

7
66.27 --> 69.27
 If you're going to smoke, smoke on the veranda.

8
69.27 --> 71.27
 But it's cold.

9
71.27 --> 74.27
 It's not cold. I don't like the smell.

10
74.27 --> 77.27
 Don't you forget that I'm pregnant?

11
80.29 --> 82.29
 Smoke on the veranda.

12
85.29 --> 87.29
 Can I stir-fry vegetables?

13
88.29 --> 89.29
 Yes, stir-fry vegetables.

14
89.29 --> 166.39
 It's cold.

15
166.39 --> 213.48
 Hello.

16
214.48 --> 215.48
 Hello.

17
216.48 --> 218.48
 It smells, doesn't it?

18
218.48 --> 220.48
 No, not at all.

19
220.48 --> 222.48
 I just came out.

20
222.48 --> 233.15
 Is that so?

21
235.15 --> 238.66
 I'm sorry I'm late to say hello.

22
238.66 --> 242.66
 This is Kono, who moved in next door about two months ago.

23
242.66 --> 243.66
 Nice to meet you.

24
243.66 --> 247.66
 I'm sorry I'm late to say hello.

25
247.66 --> 249.66
 It's okay.

26
249.66 --> 253.66
 I can't say hello on the veranda.

27
255.66 --> 257.66
 I'm Ooki.

28
257.66 --> 258.66
 Ooki?

29
258.66 --> 259.66
 Yes.

30
259.66 --> 260.66
 Nice to meet you.

31
260.66 --> 267.45
 It's cold, isn't it?

32
267.45 --> 269.45
 Yes, it is.

33
269.45 --> 275.45
 When I was smoking before, I smelled cigarettes from Ooki.

34
275.45 --> 278.45
 I wondered if you always smoked.

35
282.45 --> 287.45
 When my wife was with me, I smoked on the veranda every day.

36
288.45 --> 291.45
 I used to hate cigarettes.

37
292.45 --> 296.45
 But after I got pregnant, I hate cigarettes even more.

38
296.45 --> 298.45
 Is that so?

39
298.45 --> 304.04
 Congratulations on your pregnancy.

40
305.04 --> 307.04
 Thank you.

41
308.04 --> 313.04
 My husband doesn't like the smell of cigarettes.

42
314.04 --> 318.04
 But when my husband isn't home, I smoke in the house.

43
318.04 --> 319.04
 In the house?

44
319.04 --> 320.04
 Yes.

45
320.04 --> 322.04
 Only when he's not home.

46
322.04 --> 325.04
 I really hate it.

47
325.04 --> 328.04
 I smoke in the ventilator.

48
328.04 --> 332.04
 But I still get kicked out like this.

49
333.04 --> 335.04
 It's a narrow world, isn't it?

50
335.04 --> 337.04
 It is.

51
350.55 --> 352.55
 It's beautiful, isn't it?

52
352.55 --> 354.55
 Yes, it is.

53
354.55 --> 357.55
 It's cold, so I couldn't look up at all.

54
364.92 --> 367.92
 Well, I'm going to bed.

55
367.92 --> 368.92
 Good night.

56
368.92 --> 369.92
 Good night.

57
425.66 --> 427.66
 I'm home.

58
427.66 --> 429.66
 I bought this.

59
430.66 --> 434.49
 Thank you.

60
434.49 --> 436.49
 Did you buy a lot of radishes?

61
436.49 --> 437.49
 Of course.

62
437.49 --> 439.49
 I bought three.

63
439.49 --> 441.49
 You know well.

64
442.49 --> 444.49
 It's hot.

65
446.49 --> 447.49
 I'm tired.

66
447.49 --> 449.49
 Thank you.

67
450.49 --> 452.49
 Are you still fighting?

68
453.49 --> 455.49
 I'm still fighting.

69
455.49 --> 460.02
 Eat well.

70
460.02 --> 462.02
 I'm going to take a bath.

71
462.02 --> 506.03
 Good luck.

72
569.14 --> 571.14
 What are you doing?

73
574.64 --> 576.64
 Go to the balcony.

74
578.64 --> 656.26
 Hello.

75
656.26 --> 657.26
 Good evening.

76
657.26 --> 658.26
 Good evening.

77
658.26 --> 676.86
 It's cold.

78
676.86 --> 693.74
 It's calm.

79
694.74 --> 696.74
 Yes.

80
696.74 --> 702.74
 I like the time when I'm smoking like this.

81
704.74 --> 706.74
 I understand.

82
707.74 --> 721.03
 By the way, how are you feeling?

83
721.03 --> 723.03
 I'm fine.

84
723.03 --> 729.03
 But I evacuated so as not to make you angry.

85
731.03 --> 734.03
 I'm glad you haven't changed.

86
735.03 --> 739.03
 I have more work at home.

87
740.03 --> 744.03
 I smoke secretly at home so as not to make you angry.

88
745.03 --> 748.03
 I'm here now, so I'm smoking like this.

89
749.03 --> 751.03
 You're good at it.

90
760.94 --> 763.94
 What do you smoke?

91
764.94 --> 775.62
 I smoke COOL.

92
776.62 --> 778.62
 I used to smoke COOL.

93
778.62 --> 779.62
 Really?

94
779.62 --> 780.62
 It's delicious.

95
780.62 --> 781.62
 It's delicious.

96
782.62 --> 784.62
 It's delicious.

97
785.62 --> 787.62
 It's delicious.

98
791.32 --> 793.32
 Don't you smoke COOL anymore?

99
794.32 --> 795.32
 Yes.

100
797.32 --> 799.32
 It's a strange story.

101
799.32 --> 804.32
 There is a rumor that menstruation is dangerous.

102
806.32 --> 809.32
 It's a urban legend.

103
809.32 --> 811.32
 I don't smoke COOL anymore.

104
814.32 --> 816.32
 It's a joke.

105
823.60 --> 826.60
 Do you know where menstruation is?

106
826.60 --> 828.60
 Menstruation?

107
828.60 --> 830.60
 It's easy.

108
831.60 --> 833.60
 Is it there?

109
833.60 --> 834.60
 Where is it?

110
834.60 --> 837.60
 Is it the brightest place?

111
839.60 --> 840.60
 It's not there.

112
840.60 --> 841.60
 Is it different?

113
841.60 --> 842.60
 It's different.

114
842.60 --> 843.60
 Where is it?

115
843.60 --> 847.60
 It's the brightest place under the moon.

116
848.60 --> 849.60
 That's the Saturn.

117
850.60 --> 853.60
 If you have a binocular, you can see the rings.

118
853.60 --> 854.60
 Really?

119
855.60 --> 856.60
 That's amazing.

120
856.60 --> 858.60
 But, it's a very expensive ring.

121
859.60 --> 861.60
 It's not possible to see it unless it's a thousand times expensive.

122
862.60 --> 864.60
 I want to see it.

123
864.60 --> 866.60
 I want to see it.

124
866.60 --> 920.76
 It's the brightest place under the moon.

125
972.12 --> 973.12
 I'm home.

126
973.12 --> 982.28
 You're home.

127
999.80 --> 1034.24
 Hey.

128
1036.24 --> 1037.24
 What's up?

129
1037.24 --> 1038.24
 Come here.

130
1039.24 --> 1040.24
 I'm coming.

131
1041.24 --> 1042.24
 Come here.

132
1042.24 --> 1043.24
 I'm going to the bathroom.

133
1050.18 --> 1051.18
 Come here.

134
1053.55 --> 1054.55
 What's up?

135
1057.25 --> 1058.25
 What's going on?

136
1058.25 --> 1061.65
 I'm sorry.

137
1062.65 --> 1064.65
 Did you smoke here?

138
1064.65 --> 1065.65
 No.

139
1066.65 --> 1067.65
 I smoked there.

140
1069.65 --> 1071.65
 You don't have to be sorry.

141
1071.65 --> 1073.65
 You have a baby.

142
1073.65 --> 1075.65
 What if it affects you?

143
1076.65 --> 1077.65
 I'll be careful.

144
1077.65 --> 1080.02
 I'm sorry.

145
1080.02 --> 1081.02
 Did you buy it?

146
1084.68 --> 1085.68
 It smells bad.

147
1086.68 --> 1093.68
 I'm going to stay at a hotel tonight.

148
1093.68 --> 1094.68
 What?

149
1094.68 --> 1101.36
 Smell it before you come back.

150
1102.36 --> 1103.36
 Okay.

151
1104.36 --> 1105.36
 Come here.

152
1107.36 --> 1109.36
 I'll call you when I get home.

153
1109.36 --> 1110.36
 Okay.

154
1230.54 --> 1231.54
 Hello.

155
1231.54 --> 1232.54
 Hello.

156
1232.54 --> 1234.54
 Are you making dinner?

157
1235.54 --> 1237.54
 I'm making dinner now.

158
1238.54 --> 1242.54
 I was invited to a drink by a client.

159
1242.54 --> 1244.54
 He drinks until late.

160
1244.54 --> 1246.54
 I don't think I need dinner today.

161
1249.54 --> 1251.54
 You should have told me earlier.

162
1251.54 --> 1252.54
 I made dinner.

163
1253.54 --> 1254.54
 I'm sorry.

164
1254.54 --> 1256.54
 Let's have dinner together next time.

165
1257.54 --> 1259.54
 I'm glad.

166
1262.54 --> 1264.54
 Don't drink too much.

167
1265.54 --> 1268.54
 I think I'll drink more at the end.

168
1268.54 --> 1270.54
 Don't drink too much.

169
1270.54 --> 1271.54
 Okay.

170
1273.54 --> 1275.54
 Call me when you get home.

171
1275.54 --> 1276.54
 Okay.

172
1276.54 --> 1277.54
 Bye.

173
1277.54 --> 1278.54
 Bye.

174
1279.54 --> 1408.29
 Excuse me.

175
1409.29 --> 1417.23
 Yes.

176
1417.23 --> 1418.23
 I'm sorry.

177
1418.23 --> 1419.23
 Good evening.

178
1419.23 --> 1420.23
 Good evening.

179
1421.23 --> 1424.23
 I made too much.

180
1424.23 --> 1426.23
 I was worried.

181
1427.23 --> 1428.23
 I'm sorry.

182
1428.23 --> 1429.23
 Thank you.

183
1435.26 --> 1436.26
 Where is your wife?

184
1439.26 --> 1442.26
 She said it smelled bad.

185
1443.26 --> 1446.26
 She said she was going to stay at a hotel tonight.

186
1447.26 --> 1448.26
 Is that so?

187
1448.26 --> 1449.26
 Yes.

188
1454.19 --> 1455.19
 Are you done?

189
1455.19 --> 1456.19
 What's wrong?

190
1457.19 --> 1458.19
 I don't know.

191
1458.19 --> 1459.19
 Does it smell?

192
1467.69 --> 1468.69
 I don't know.

193
1468.69 --> 1469.69
 I know.

194
1470.69 --> 1472.69
 People who know don't know.

195
1474.69 --> 1476.69
 I made too much.

196
1482.13 --> 1485.13
 These are ingredients for hot pot.

197
1486.13 --> 1491.70
 Would you like to make hot pot with me?

198
1491.70 --> 1492.70
 What?

199
1493.70 --> 1494.70
 Are you sure?

200
1495.70 --> 1497.70
 I'm glad you're hungry.

201
1497.70 --> 1498.70
 Really?

202
1499.70 --> 1502.70
 It's boring to eat hot pot alone.

203
1502.70 --> 1503.70
 That's right.

204
1504.70 --> 1508.42
 Then...

205
1509.42 --> 1510.42
 Wait a minute.

206
1510.42 --> 1513.42
 I'll be right back.

207
1513.42 --> 1514.42
 Wait a minute.

208
1515.42 --> 1526.18
 Thank you for waiting.

209
1526.18 --> 1527.18
 Thank you.

210
1527.18 --> 1536.53
 Thank you.

211
1537.53 --> 1548.54
 Thank you.

212
1549.54 --> 1550.54
 Thank you.

213
1564.22 --> 1566.22
 Do you want me to hold it?

214
1566.22 --> 1567.22
 Please sit down.

215
1567.22 --> 1568.22
 Thank you.

216
1569.22 --> 1578.58
 It smells good.

217
1579.58 --> 1581.58
 It's miso hot pot.

218
1581.58 --> 1582.58
 I see.

219
1583.58 --> 1587.58
 Would you like to drink with me?

220
1587.58 --> 1588.58
 Can I?

221
1589.58 --> 1590.58
 Yes.

222
1592.58 --> 1598.06
 Do you like beer?

223
1598.06 --> 1600.06
 I'm fine with anything.

224
1600.06 --> 1601.06
 Okay.

225
1603.06 --> 1621.76
 Thank you.

226
1621.76 --> 1622.76
 Thank you.

227
1623.76 --> 1624.76
 I'm sorry I didn't notice you.

228
1624.76 --> 1625.76
 It's okay.

229
1626.76 --> 1629.33
 I'm sorry.

230
1637.08 --> 1638.08
 I'm fine.

231
1639.08 --> 1640.08
 Do you like beer?

232
1640.08 --> 1641.08
 Yes.

233
1641.08 --> 1642.08
 I'm sorry.

234
1643.08 --> 1665.87
 Thank you.

235
1665.87 --> 1666.87
 It's delicious.

236
1667.87 --> 1668.87
 Then, let's eat.

237
1669.87 --> 1672.38
 It's delicious.

238
1674.38 --> 1676.38
 I'm wearing glasses.

239
1676.38 --> 1678.38
 It's like a commercial.

240
1692.35 --> 1695.11
 Is there anything you can't eat?

241
1695.11 --> 1697.11
 I can eat anything.

242
1698.11 --> 1714.26
 But, I can't eat alone.

243
1714.26 --> 1715.26
 That's right.

244
1717.26 --> 1718.26
 You eat hot pot every day.

245
1718.26 --> 1719.26
 That's right.

246
1720.26 --> 1724.05
 It smells good.

247
1725.05 --> 1727.05
 I don't know if it suits my taste.

248
1728.05 --> 1731.05
 I can tell just by smelling it.

249
1731.05 --> 1732.05
 It must be delicious.

250
1733.05 --> 1734.05
 Really?

251
1750.00 --> 1751.00
 Thank you.

252
1755.00 --> 1756.00
 Thank you.

253
1757.00 --> 1774.86
 How is it?

254
1776.86 --> 1777.86
 It's delicious.

255
1777.86 --> 1778.86
 It's delicious.

256
1782.86 --> 1783.86
 It warms me up.

257
1783.86 --> 1784.86
 It warms me up.

258
1788.86 --> 1790.86
 Did you grow this Chinese cabbage yourself?

259
1791.86 --> 1792.86
 That's right.

260
1794.86 --> 1796.86
 I didn't know it was that white.

261
1798.86 --> 1799.86
 It's okay because it's the same color.

262
1800.86 --> 1806.06
 It's delicious.

263
1808.06 --> 1809.06
 It's delicious.

264
1810.06 --> 1812.06
 You look like you're enjoying it.

265
1812.06 --> 1813.06
 It's really delicious.

266
1815.06 --> 1818.06
 My husband doesn't say it's delicious.

267
1819.06 --> 1821.06
 I'd be happy if he said so.

268
1823.06 --> 1824.06
 It's so delicious.

269
1825.06 --> 1826.06
 Would you like some more?

270
1827.06 --> 1828.06
 May I?

271
1828.06 --> 1829.06
 Of course.

272
1829.06 --> 1830.06
 Thank you.

273
1831.06 --> 1832.06
 Thank you.

274
1836.78 --> 1837.78
 Your husband is shy.

275
1839.78 --> 1842.78
 There are many men who can't say that.

276
1845.78 --> 1848.78
 But he says it clearly.

277
1851.78 --> 1852.78
 It depends on the person.

278
1853.78 --> 1856.78
 You tell your wife, don't you?

279
1856.78 --> 1859.78
 I feel like I have a duty to my wife.

280
1861.78 --> 1863.78
 Konno is very beautiful.

281
1865.78 --> 1870.11
 It's strange to say that I'm out.

282
1872.11 --> 1873.11
 Thank you.

283
1874.11 --> 1875.11
 Can I eat all of this?

284
1876.11 --> 1878.11
 I can't eat all of this.

285
1879.11 --> 1885.37
 I wish I had a husband like you.

286
1887.37 --> 1892.37
 If we were married, we would have a world war.

287
1893.37 --> 1895.37
 I don't know what a world war is.

288
1897.37 --> 1899.37
 Is it like this?

289
1899.37 --> 1900.37
 I don't know.

290
1901.37 --> 1905.37
 But if we get married, it'll be a little more complicated.

291
1906.37 --> 1907.37
 Is that so?

292
1908.37 --> 1912.15
 I'll take good care of you.

293
1912.15 --> 1914.15
 What did I say?

294
1915.15 --> 1916.15
 It's like a proposal.

295
1916.15 --> 1917.15
 I'll take good care of you.

296
1918.15 --> 1924.92
 Can you drink a lot?

297
1925.92 --> 1927.92
 I'm not that strong.

298
1928.92 --> 1929.92
 Cheers.

299
1960.30 --> 1961.30
 It was delicious.

300
1961.30 --> 1962.30
 I'm full.

301
1962.30 --> 1963.30
 Thank you for the meal.

302
1963.30 --> 1964.30
 Thank you for the meal.

303
1964.30 --> 1965.30
 Thank you for the meal.

304
1968.30 --> 1969.30
 I ate a lot.

305
1970.30 --> 1971.30
 I'm going to eat a lot.

306
1972.30 --> 1973.30
 I'm going to eat a lot, too.

307
1974.30 --> 1975.30
 Please sit down.

308
1976.30 --> 1977.30
 Thank you.

309
1977.30 --> 1979.30
 I'll clean up later.

310
1991.47 --> 1993.47
 I'm happy to be full.

311
1994.47 --> 1995.47
 I'm happy, too.

312
1998.04 --> 1999.04
 I'm going to work.

313
1999.04 --> 2003.21
 I'm going to work.

314
2004.21 --> 2005.21
 I'm going to work.

315
2006.21 --> 2008.21
 I'll clean up the veranda.

316
2010.21 --> 2012.21
 My husband is coming home late.

317
2012.21 --> 2014.21
 I don't think he'll come home yet.

318
2015.21 --> 2016.21
 Let's clean up here.

319
2017.21 --> 2018.21
 That's right.

320
2021.21 --> 2026.21
 I'm going to change the smell of this sandwich.

321
2026.21 --> 2028.21
 Don't worry about it.

322
2029.21 --> 2032.21
 I don't think it's the usual smell.

323
2033.21 --> 2035.21
 I don't think he'll notice it.

324
2035.21 --> 2037.21
 I don't think he'll notice it.

325
2039.21 --> 2040.21
 I don't think so.

326
2041.21 --> 2042.21
 I'm sorry.

327
2046.21 --> 2057.62
 The tobacco in the bar is the best.

328
2059.62 --> 2061.62
 You've become a father.

329
2062.62 --> 2063.62
 That's not true.

330
2067.62 --> 2071.62
 When did you start smoking?

331
2072.62 --> 2077.62
 I think it was when I started my current job.

332
2081.15 --> 2083.15
 It relieves my stress.

333
2084.15 --> 2085.15
 That's right.

334
2085.15 --> 2088.15
 When I take a lunch break, I smoke.

335
2089.15 --> 2091.15
 I can concentrate in the afternoon.

336
2092.15 --> 2094.15
 That's why I started smoking.

337
2094.15 --> 2095.15
 I see.

338
2095.15 --> 2098.15
 My previous job was a salesman.

339
2099.15 --> 2105.15
 I was criticized by the company and the customers.

340
2106.15 --> 2111.15
 When I got home, I took a deep breath.

341
2114.42 --> 2116.42
 I was like this.

342
2117.42 --> 2120.42
 I was angry and smoked.

343
2121.42 --> 2123.42
 It was hard for you.

344
2124.42 --> 2125.42
 I'm grateful for that.

345
2125.42 --> 2128.42
 I smoke as much as I want.

346
2134.98 --> 2137.98
 Is the electronic tobacco delicious?

347
2138.98 --> 2140.98
 I don't think it's delicious.

348
2141.98 --> 2143.98
 I haven't thought about it.

349
2144.98 --> 2147.98
 I haven't taught it to anyone recently.

350
2147.98 --> 2148.98
 I agree.

351
2150.98 --> 2152.98
 I don't like paper.

352
2153.98 --> 2155.98
 I don't like paper, but I like electronic tobacco.

353
2155.98 --> 2160.98
 Well, it can't be helped.

354
2160.98 --> 2166.98
 After I get pregnant, it's better than smoking.

355
2166.98 --> 2169.98
 It's just that I don't have a towel.

356
2169.98 --> 2175.98
 I don't have a towel, so it's not so bad for my body.

357
2175.98 --> 2177.98
 Oh, I see.

358
2177.98 --> 2180.98
 I've only brushed my hair.

359
2180.98 --> 2183.98
 But it's not boring.

360
2183.98 --> 2185.98
 But you'll get used to it soon.

361
2185.98 --> 2186.98
 Really?

362
2186.98 --> 2188.98
 You'll get used to it after three days.

363
2188.98 --> 2191.98
 Can I try it?

364
2191.98 --> 2193.98
 Sure.

365
2193.98 --> 2195.98
 Oh, no, no, no.

366
2195.98 --> 2198.98
 It's a waste.

367
2198.98 --> 2215.48
 It's like this.

368
2215.48 --> 2225.08
 It's less boring than normal smoking.

369
2225.08 --> 2232.08
 Yes, it's less boring at first, but you'll get used to it.

370
2232.08 --> 2235.08
 Can I get used to it?

371
2235.08 --> 2242.02
 Yes, you can.

372
2242.02 --> 2244.02
 Oh, I don't want to.

373
2244.02 --> 2249.31
 You'll get drunk.

374
2249.31 --> 2252.82
 Is my face red?

375
2252.82 --> 2255.82
 It's okay.

376
2255.82 --> 2264.69
 I get drunk easily when I drink.

377
2264.69 --> 2269.69
 How long have you been pregnant?

378
2269.69 --> 2272.69
 Do you want to know that?

379
2272.69 --> 2276.69
 If you're going to ask me that, go out with me.

380
2276.69 --> 2277.69
 Thank you.

381
2277.69 --> 2281.69
 I'll wait a little.

382
2281.69 --> 2287.69
 It's been about four months.

383
2287.69 --> 2291.70
 Oh, four months.

384
2291.70 --> 2294.70
 Then you'll get bigger and bigger.

385
2294.70 --> 2297.70
 That's right.

386
2297.70 --> 2300.70
 You're a good baby.

387
2300.70 --> 2303.70
 I envy you.

388
2303.70 --> 2307.70
 Don't you have any plans?

389
2307.70 --> 2310.70
 No, I don't.

390
2310.70 --> 2314.70
 I've just had both.

391
2314.70 --> 2319.70
 So I don't have much time.

392
2319.70 --> 2323.70
 My husband comes home late.

393
2323.70 --> 2326.70
 I don't feel like that.

394
2326.70 --> 2329.70
 It's a waste.

395
2329.70 --> 2334.70
 I didn't know you were such a beautiful woman.

396
2334.70 --> 2346.29
 I smoke a lot.

397
2346.29 --> 2350.29
 I smoke at home because it's cold.

398
2350.29 --> 2355.29
 I'm glad you're so calm.

399
2362.29 --> 2369.29
 Can you have sex while you're pregnant?

400
2369.29 --> 2374.29
 I don't know if it's okay.

401
2374.29 --> 2382.29
 But I think I'll do it when I know I'm pregnant.

402
2382.29 --> 2385.29
 That's great.

403
2385.29 --> 2391.29
 I think it's the same for everyone.

404
2391.29 --> 2399.29
 If your wife doesn't let you have sex, your husband can cheat on you.

405
2399.29 --> 2402.29
 That's right.

406
2402.29 --> 2405.29
 Is your husband bad?

407
2405.29 --> 2408.29
 No, I don't think so.

408
2408.29 --> 2411.29
 You don't think so?

409
2411.29 --> 2423.13
 That's great.

410
2423.13 --> 2428.13
 I haven't had sex with my wife for a while.

411
2428.13 --> 2431.13
 How long has it been?

412
2431.13 --> 2434.95
 Two or three months.

413
2434.95 --> 2437.95
 What about you?

414
2437.95 --> 2442.95
 I'm not pregnant.

415
2442.95 --> 2448.33
 I think it's been a year.

416
2448.33 --> 2451.33
 Really?

417
2451.33 --> 2454.33
 I haven't had sex for half a year.

418
2454.33 --> 2459.33
 It's a waste.

419
2461.33 --> 2470.96
 Ever since I started smoking, my husband doesn't like it.

420
2470.96 --> 2472.96
 I see.

421
2472.96 --> 2477.96
 He doesn't even kiss me.

422
2477.96 --> 2530.16
 He doesn't have sex with me.

423
2530.16 --> 2536.50
 That's great.

424
2536.50 --> 2541.51
 I'm serious.

425
2542.51 --> 2553.33
 Isn't it hot?

426
2553.33 --> 2558.83
 It's been a while.

427
2558.83 --> 2632.54
 Isn't it hot?

428
2648.70 --> 2675.40
 It's soft.

429
2675.40 --> 2678.40
 It's a little cramped here.

430
2678.40 --> 2681.40
 Let's go over there.

431
2681.40 --> 2754.61
 Okay.

432
2754.61 --> 2799.44
 I'm a little embarrassed to be invited by you.

433
2799.44 --> 2851.12
 It's been a while.

434
2851.12 --> 2905.82
 It feels good.

435
2905.82 --> 2912.05
 Really?

436
2912.05 --> 2958.02
 It's wet.

437
2958.02 --> 2960.02
 It's wet.

438
2960.02 --> 2973.40
 It's very wet.

439
2973.40 --> 2980.49
 It's very hard.

440
2980.49 --> 2983.49
 It's very wet.

441
2983.49 --> 2990.90
 It's been a while.

442
2990.90 --> 2997.56
 You're good.

443
3008.13 --> 3012.66
 I'm sorry.

444
3126.29 --> 3161.47
 It's soft.

445
3210.84 --> 3224.01
 It feels good.

446
3246.06 --> 3266.82
 You're good.

447
3266.82 --> 3268.82
 I'm glad to hear that.

448
3268.82 --> 3271.82
 I'm glad to hear that.

449
3271.82 --> 3274.82
 You're good.

450
3274.82 --> 3334.03
 How big are you?

451
3334.03 --> 3425.45
 I'm embarrassed.

452
3425.45 --> 3468.84
 Isn't it bad?

453
3468.84 --> 3485.82
 It's coming out.

454
3559.23 --> 3563.23
 Please lick there.

455
3563.23 --> 3577.78
 You like it.

456
3577.78 --> 3609.67
 I'm sorry.

457
3609.67 --> 3628.26
 I'm sorry, too.

458
3628.26 --> 3630.26
 You don't like it, do you?

459
3630.26 --> 3632.26
 I don't like it.

460
3632.26 --> 3635.26
 Let me see.

461
3635.26 --> 3645.65
 Please wait a minute.

462
3645.65 --> 3662.40
 Did you find it?

463
3662.40 --> 3665.40
 I found it.

464
3665.40 --> 3670.22
 Is there anything in it?

465
3670.22 --> 3743.02
 It's been a while.

466
3743.02 --> 3780.02
 I'm sorry.

467
3780.02 --> 3806.02
 It's come out.

468
3838.08 --> 3851.74
 It's been a while.

469
3901.06 --> 3913.94
 Are you okay?

470
3913.94 --> 3921.68
 I'll do it here.

471
3921.68 --> 3924.68
 There.

472
3924.68 --> 3928.38
 There.

473
3998.68 --> 4014.25
 I'll do it here.

474
4015.25 --> 4018.25
 I'll do it here.

475
4047.06 --> 4052.06
 Can you do it from behind?

476
4052.06 --> 4106.18
 From behind?

477
4106.18 --> 4110.18
 I like to do it from behind.

478
4110.18 --> 4116.84
 You like it, don't you?

479
4116.84 --> 4134.97
 I won't put it in.

480
4134.97 --> 4137.97
 Please don't do it.

481
4189.66 --> 4227.61
 It feels good.

482
4299.03 --> 4403.52
 Can I touch you?

483
4403.52 --> 4437.05
 It's coming out.

484
4445.78 --> 4448.78
 It's been a while.

485
4448.78 --> 4451.78
 It's come out.

486
4451.78 --> 4458.26
 I'm sorry.

487
4488.53 --> 4491.53
 It's come out a lot.

488
4491.53 --> 4494.53
 I'm sorry.

489
4494.53 --> 4500.57
 It's been a while.

490
4500.57 --> 4503.57
 It feels good.

491
4503.57 --> 4507.57
 I'm sorry.

492
4518.90 --> 4535.66
 I'll put it in the can.

493
4535.66 --> 4538.66
 It's dangerous.

494
4538.66 --> 4563.45
 I'll put it in the can.

495
4563.45 --> 4566.45
 I'll put it in.

496
4568.45 --> 4581.14
 I'll put it in.

497
4581.14 --> 4586.67
 I'll do it.

498
4586.67 --> 4637.00
 Let's do it.

499
4637.00 --> 4640.00
 Are you okay?

500
4640.00 --> 4643.00
 I'm okay.

501
4648.49 --> 4651.49
 It's been a while.

502
4651.49 --> 4654.49
 It's been a while.

503
4654.49 --> 4658.49
 I was embarrassed because it came out a lot.

504
4658.49 --> 4661.49
 Thank you.

505
4661.49 --> 4664.49
 I'm sorry.

506
4664.49 --> 4667.49
 I drank too much.

507
4678.85 --> 4683.85
 It's good to have a drink after a meal.

508
4683.85 --> 4686.85
 It's delicious.

509
4686.85 --> 4690.85
 I can't do this after a meal.

510
4690.85 --> 4695.85
 I used to get angry when I smoked after a meal.

511
4695.85 --> 4697.85
 I understand.

512
4698.85 --> 4701.85
 That's right.

513
4701.85 --> 4707.61
 I felt a sense of separation.

514
4707.61 --> 4711.61
 I got angry because there was no mood.

515
4711.61 --> 4716.05
 It's cute.

516
4718.05 --> 4721.05
 Is it me?

517
4722.05 --> 4728.02
 It's cute.

518
4728.02 --> 4755.44
 I miss this.

519
4755.44 --> 4758.44
 I used to smoke a lot because I liked the taste.

520
4758.44 --> 4761.44
 It's a double-smoker.

521
4761.44 --> 4763.44
 Is that so?

522
4763.44 --> 4766.44
 It's like a hyper-turbo.

523
4774.68 --> 4785.46
 I'll buy it when I smoke it.

524
4871.82 --> 4874.82
 Did you see the news?

525
4874.82 --> 4878.82
 It seems that a violent gangster is coming.

526
4878.82 --> 4881.82
 Is it violent?

527
4882.82 --> 4885.82
 It's like smoking outside.

528
4885.82 --> 4887.82
 It's impossible.

529
4887.82 --> 4890.82
 It's a rumor that the smoke will freeze.

530
4890.82 --> 4893.82
 Really?

531
4893.82 --> 4896.82
 It's a rumor.

532
4896.82 --> 4898.82
 How far is it a rumor?

533
4898.82 --> 4901.82
 It's a rumor of a violent gangster.

534
4901.82 --> 4904.82
 Is it a rumor of a violent gangster?

535
4905.82 --> 4914.86
 Who made this rumor?

536
4914.86 --> 4917.86
 It's hard to meet a woman here.

537
4917.86 --> 4920.86
 The number of women is decreasing.

538
4920.86 --> 4926.71
 I can't meet a woman here.

539
4926.71 --> 4929.71
 It's hard.

540
4929.71 --> 4937.18
 That's right.

541
4937.18 --> 4942.18
 Do you know what you can do there?

542
4942.18 --> 4944.18
 I don't know.

543
4944.18 --> 4946.18
 You can buy a building there.

544
4946.18 --> 4949.18
 You can buy a building there.

545
4950.18 --> 4954.18
 I'm looking forward to the store on the first floor.

546
4954.18 --> 4957.50
 Why?

547
4957.50 --> 4960.50
 I heard that Hakata Ramen is open there.

548
4960.50 --> 4961.50
 That's good.

549
4961.50 --> 4964.50
 It's a place where you can line up.

550
4964.50 --> 4968.50
 If you can't line up, you have to go there.

551
4968.50 --> 4970.50
 I can see it from here.

552
4970.50 --> 4987.82
 What is it?

553
4987.82 --> 5002.70
 It's a secret story.

554
5003.70 --> 5057.86
 I haven't been found out.

555
5063.83 --> 5066.83
 I may have been found out.

556
5067.83 --> 5069.83
 That's a problem.

557
5069.83 --> 5071.83
 That's bad.

558
5081.44 --> 5085.44
 How is your husband lately?

559
5086.44 --> 5092.78
 He comes home later than before.

560
5092.78 --> 5094.78
 Is that so?

561
5096.78 --> 5102.78
 Can I go to your room again?

562
5102.78 --> 5108.07
 Of course.

563
5110.07 --> 5165.71
 I may be seen from the outside.

564
5182.11 --> 5196.94
 I'll go back to my room.

565
5196.94 --> 5198.94
 Good night.

566
5198.94 --> 5214.78
 In the middle of the night.

567
5214.78 --> 5247.02
 It's going to rain.

568
5247.02 --> 5249.02
 That's right.

569
5249.02 --> 5253.02
 If it rains tomorrow, will you go to Koinadori?

570
5253.02 --> 5256.65
 Thank you.

571
5258.65 --> 5261.65
 I'm going to take a nap.

572
5460.05 --> 5471.17
 You're very wet.

573
5491.23 --> 5494.23
 Why are you so wet?

574
5494.23 --> 5500.40
 I feel so good.

575
5542.50 --> 5582.66
 Can I lick you?

576
5582.66 --> 5630.64
 Of course.

577
5656.71 --> 5658.71
 Does it feel good?

578
5658.71 --> 5660.71
 Yes.

579
5699.45 --> 5710.73
 It's hot.

580
5754.90 --> 5760.46
 It's hot.

581
5767.18 --> 5779.49
 Good night.

582
5779.49 --> 5784.25
 It's time to go to bed.

583
5784.25 --> 5788.58
 It's hot.

584
5788.58 --> 5796.69
 I can't sleep for a long time.

585
5797.69 --> 5802.69
 Can I put this in my mouth?

586
5857.64 --> 5861.27
 I'm sorry.

587
5861.27 --> 5866.16
 I want to put this in my mouth.

588
5875.27 --> 5895.46
 You're very good at licking.

589
5895.46 --> 5918.46
 I thought you were amazing.

590
5918.46 --> 5920.46
 That's right.

591
5925.15 --> 5928.15
 You sound like a minister.

592
5937.01 --> 5939.01
 I'm sorry.

593
5940.01 --> 5952.57
 I feel like I can't see you anymore.

594
5967.02 --> 5976.76
 I think you're sleeping.

595
5976.76 --> 5978.76
 What are you talking about?

596
5978.76 --> 5983.65
 The smell of smoke.

597
5983.65 --> 5986.65
 Do you mean my smell?

598
5986.65 --> 5987.65
 No.

599
5987.65 --> 5995.37
 Women have a sharp sense of smell.

600
5996.37 --> 5997.37
 That's right.

601
5997.37 --> 6014.03
 It's lonely to sleep alone.

602
6016.03 --> 6018.03
 My husband won't come home today.

603
6018.03 --> 6023.30
 You're a bad husband.

604
6023.30 --> 6025.30
 I think you're a bad husband.

605
6025.30 --> 6028.30
 Because I chose you.

606
6060.27 --> 6063.27
 Don't look at me.

607
6072.58 --> 6076.59
 You're shining.

608
6275.06 --> 6290.02
 What are you doing?

609
6290.02 --> 6315.28
 I'm sorry.

610
6315.28 --> 6317.28
 I'll put this in my mouth.

611
6408.40 --> 6410.40
 I'll throw it away.

612
6410.40 --> 6412.40
 Are you okay?

613
6412.40 --> 6414.40
 I'll hide it.

614
6415.40 --> 6418.78
 I'm sorry.

615
6418.78 --> 6427.06
 I'll put this in my mouth.

616
6427.06 --> 6429.06
 That's right.

617
6433.06 --> 6441.23
 Are you okay?

618
6441.23 --> 6443.23
 You're burning.

619
6443.23 --> 6445.23
 I'm fine.

620
6446.23 --> 6457.29
 Can I exchange it?

621
6457.29 --> 6459.29
 Exchange?

622
6459.29 --> 6468.23
 I can't close it.

623
6473.62 --> 6475.62
 Wow.

624
6475.62 --> 6482.26
 I've never done this before.

625
6482.26 --> 6484.26
 Is it bad?

626
6484.26 --> 6485.26
 No.

627
6485.26 --> 6487.26
 I'm happy.

628
6487.26 --> 6489.26
 Your feet are cold.

629
6490.26 --> 6492.26
 Your feet are cold.

630
6502.76 --> 6504.76
 I don't want to.

631
6504.76 --> 6506.76
 I don't want to.

632
6506.76 --> 6509.52
 Why?

633
6509.52 --> 6512.52
 I think your feet are the best.

634
6513.52 --> 6515.52
 Because your feet are hot.

635
6516.52 --> 6534.14
 What will happen to us if we have sex?

636
6537.14 --> 6539.14
 We'll be killed.

637
6541.14 --> 6543.14
 That's right.

638
6543.14 --> 6545.14
 That's right.

639
6545.14 --> 6551.14
 If my husband finds out, we'll get married.

640
6552.14 --> 6554.14
 Are you afraid of him?

641
6554.14 --> 6556.14
 No.

642
6556.14 --> 6569.42
 He's a very kind person.

643
6569.42 --> 6571.42
 Let's talk about something fun.

644
6571.42 --> 6573.42
 Yes, let's talk about something fun.

645
6578.29 --> 6580.29
 It's midnight.

646
6580.29 --> 6591.09
 It's this kind of light.

647
6591.09 --> 6593.09
 What are you looking at?

648
6594.09 --> 6596.09
 I'll make you some tea.

649
6596.09 --> 6598.09
 Do you want some tea?

650
6598.09 --> 6600.09
 Tea?

651
6600.09 --> 6602.09
 Do you want me to make it?

652
6602.09 --> 6603.09
 No, I'm fine.

653
6603.09 --> 6605.09
 Are you okay?

654
6606.09 --> 6608.09
 How's work?

655
6608.09 --> 6610.09
 Is it okay?

656
6612.09 --> 6614.09
 It's okay.

657
6616.09 --> 6622.09
 You seem to have a lot of overtime work.

658
6622.09 --> 6624.09
 You must be busy.

659
6624.09 --> 6626.09
 I have to work hard.

660
6628.09 --> 6637.67
 Here you are.

661
6648.90 --> 6650.90
 I have something to tell you.

662
6651.90 --> 6653.90
 What is it?

663
6653.90 --> 6656.90
 I'm going to have a baby soon.

664
6657.90 --> 6665.90
 I thought it would be small for three people to live in this room.

665
6665.90 --> 6667.90
 Do you want to move?

666
6669.90 --> 6671.90
 I've heard that before.

667
6671.90 --> 6673.90
 That's right.

668
6673.90 --> 6675.90
 It's going to be small.

669
6675.90 --> 6677.90
 Right?

670
6677.90 --> 6680.90
 I can't dress up when I have a baby.

671
6680.90 --> 6682.90
 That's right.

672
6683.90 --> 6688.90
 If you have a baby, will you stop smoking?

673
6689.90 --> 6691.90
 That's right.

674
6691.90 --> 6693.90
 It's a promise.

675
6693.90 --> 6695.90
 Okay.

676
6695.90 --> 6697.90
 I want to tell you that.

677
6699.90 --> 6753.13
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

678
6753.13 --> 6755.13
 I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

679
6762.22 --> 6764.22
 It's warm.

680
6765.22 --> 6767.22
 It was cold, wasn't it?

681
6767.22 --> 6797.60
 It was cold.

682
6804.19 --> 6809.19
 I'm going to have a baby soon.

683
6812.98 --> 6814.98
 Is that so?

684
6814.98 --> 6816.98
 Congratulations.

685
6816.98 --> 6818.98
 Thank you.

686
6819.98 --> 6826.63
 I've decided to move.

687
6826.63 --> 6836.19
 Have you decided where to live?

688
6837.19 --> 6841.19
 I've just decided.

689
6852.73 --> 6862.19
 If I have a baby, I'll quit smoking.

690
6863.19 --> 6865.19
 That's great.

691
6865.19 --> 6870.19
 I don't know if I can do it, but I have to do it.

692
6874.04 --> 6876.04
 And...

693
6877.04 --> 6889.85
 I have to quit this kind of relationship.

694
6890.85 --> 6894.85
 I don't want to be exposed.

695
6894.85 --> 6917.14
 I don't think it's a good idea.

696
6919.14 --> 6929.14
 Do you want to smoke a lot and have a lot of sex?

697
6931.14 --> 6937.14
 I don't want to end it like this.

698
6938.14 --> 6944.14
 I want to end it.

699
6946.14 --> 6949.14
 That's right.

700
6953.18 --> 6957.56
 Do you want to end it?

701
6957.56 --> 6973.70
 I want to.

702
6973.70 --> 6975.70
 That's good.

703
6975.70 --> 7060.42
 I want to.

704
7060.42 --> 7070.33
 It's a nice view.

705
7070.33 --> 7086.80
 It's been a while since I've seen this view.

706
7086.80 --> 7089.80
 Don't you come to places like this?

707
7089.80 --> 7091.80
 I don't come here at all.

708
7092.80 --> 7095.80
 I don't know how many years it's been.

709
7095.80 --> 7098.80
 I don't know either.

710
7114.75 --> 7129.94
 I can smoke here.

711
7129.94 --> 7131.94
 Of course.

712
7131.94 --> 7134.94
 If you smoke here, you'll be angry.

713
7135.94 --> 7141.94
 If it's a good hotel like this, there are a lot of places I can't smoke.

714
7142.94 --> 7148.94
 You're looking for a hotel where you can smoke, right?

715
7190.11 --> 7200.96
 I haven't quit smoking yet, but I feel like this is the last one.

716
7202.96 --> 7214.98
 Do you want to get married and quit smoking together?

717
7215.98 --> 7222.98
 That's right.

718
7222.98 --> 7225.98
 I don't want to waste it.

719
7236.14 --> 7239.14
 Do you move soon?

720
7240.14 --> 7243.14
 That's right.

721
7244.14 --> 7251.14
 I have to set up a new environment as soon as possible.

722
7273.42 --> 7276.42
 Your hands are beautiful.

723
7279.42 --> 7281.42
 Is that true?

724
7281.42 --> 7283.42
 That's true.

725
7283.42 --> 7287.42
 Maybe it's because I don't smoke much.

726
7287.42 --> 7290.42
 I took it with me.

727
7290.42 --> 7294.86
 I'll do it again.

728
7307.60 --> 7322.42
 I feel strange when I think this is the last time.

729
7323.42 --> 7327.42
 It's the last time, but it's like the first time.

730
7329.42 --> 7332.42
 Did I say something good?

731
7332.42 --> 7334.42
 I don't think so.

732
7334.42 --> 7337.42
 I don't smoke.

733
7337.42 --> 7340.42
 How about this?

734
7340.42 --> 7342.42
 I think it's good.

735
7342.42 --> 7361.10
 Please give me a reward.

736
7361.10 --> 7371.81
 It's embarrassing.

737
7371.81 --> 7375.81
 It's been a long time since we ate hot pot together.

738
7377.81 --> 7380.81
 I think it was about 10 years ago.

739
7380.81 --> 7382.81
 That's too much.

740
7382.81 --> 7395.95
 I said too much.

741
7396.95 --> 7399.95
 You wanted to eat Hakata ramen together, didn't you?

742
7399.95 --> 7401.95
 That's right.

743
7401.95 --> 7405.95
 I'll move before I can.

744
7406.95 --> 7415.55
 I don't think it's ready yet.

745
7415.55 --> 7419.55
 Please remember when you ate Hakata ramen.

746
7424.23 --> 7431.49
 Do you want to break up this year?

747
7432.49 --> 7435.49
 Do you want to break up?

748
7517.35 --> 7526.36
 It hurts.

749
7526.36 --> 7528.36
 It's my first time.

750
7528.36 --> 7548.86
 Me, too.

751
7602.35 --> 7605.35
 I'm sorry.

752
7605.35 --> 7607.35
 I'm sorry.

753
7607.35 --> 7611.56
 I'm sorry.

754
7613.56 --> 7616.56
 I don't know what it is.

755
7616.56 --> 7619.56
 I haven't seen you for a long time.

756
7620.56 --> 7622.56
 Is that so?

757
7623.56 --> 7627.56
 I was wondering what to do if you came back on the way.

758
7704.66 --> 7774.98
 It's beautiful.

759
7776.98 --> 7779.98
 Please open your eyes.

760
7784.86 --> 7786.86
 Please look at me.

761
7789.86 --> 7791.86
 It's amazing.

762
7792.86 --> 7795.86
 Are you wet, too?

763
7795.86 --> 7801.02
 It hurts.

764
7839.55 --> 7841.55
 Are you wet?

765
7864.82 --> 7898.44
 Don't you feel uncomfortable?

766
7919.66 --> 7942.26
 I'm sorry.

767
7969.46 --> 7973.03
 Please look at me.

768
7996.06 --> 8057.94
 Please lick me.

769
8196.92 --> 8204.68
 I'm sorry.

770
8296.76 --> 8298.76
 Do you feel good?

771
8298.76 --> 8300.76
 I feel good.

772
8315.17 --> 8326.74
 I'm sorry.

773
8393.56 --> 8503.47
 Please move your head.

774
8544.71 --> 8546.71
 I'm sorry.

775
8623.79 --> 8637.77
 I'll do it again if you do it too hard.

776
8700.77 --> 8702.77
 I'm sorry.

777
8764.50 --> 8794.15
 I forgot.

778
8794.15 --> 8796.15
 That's right.

779
8797.15 --> 8801.15
 I forgot about the rubber ball.

780
8801.15 --> 8812.78
 That's right.

781
8812.78 --> 8814.78
 It's the last time.

782
8814.78 --> 8818.61
 Let's do it as it is.

783
8844.01 --> 8856.09
 I'm sorry.

784
8878.54 --> 8882.37
 I did it.

785
8934.43 --> 8943.12
 Please touch my face.

786
8943.12 --> 8956.80
 I'm sorry.

787
8990.29 --> 9010.50
 Do you feel good?

788
9012.50 --> 9014.50
 I feel good.

789
9027.78 --> 9045.75
 I'm sorry.

790
9065.96 --> 9067.96
 I'm sorry.

791
9123.99 --> 9125.99
 I feel good.

792
9132.43 --> 9135.87
 I'm sorry.

793
9200.38 --> 9228.46
 I feel good.

794
9240.00 --> 9298.67
 I'm sorry.

795
9319.22 --> 9342.76
 I'm sorry.

796
9364.06 --> 9366.06
 I'm sorry.

797
9449.84 --> 9456.22
 I'm sorry.

798
9482.35 --> 9484.35
 I'm sorry.

799
9498.88 --> 9500.88
 I'm sorry.

800
9575.88 --> 9580.73
 It's the last time.

801
9580.73 --> 9582.73
 It's the last time.

802
9584.73 --> 9587.73
 I'm sorry.

803
9643.21 --> 9674.87
 I did it.

804
9675.87 --> 9677.87
 I'm sorry.

805
9679.87 --> 9681.87
 I'm sorry.

806
9681.87 --> 9685.50
 It's warm.

807
9685.50 --> 9688.50
 Ah, it's so wet.

808
9706.34 --> 9708.34
 I'm sorry.

809
9708.34 --> 9710.34
 It's all right.

810
9713.34 --> 9716.34
 Are you all right?

811
9720.34 --> 9724.34
 It's a safety day, so I'm fine.

812
9727.87 --> 9731.87
 I don't want to bother you.

813
9746.26 --> 9751.70
 After all, at times like this...

814
9751.70 --> 9753.70
 Is this it?

815
9755.70 --> 9757.70
 That's right.

816
9808.07 --> 9825.73
 My heart is still pounding.

817
9825.73 --> 9850.10
 I shot you.

818
9850.10 --> 9878.38
 I shot you.

819
9878.38 --> 9881.38
 Did you feel good?

820
9883.75 --> 9886.75
 Of course I felt good.

821
9886.75 --> 9890.90
 How about you?

822
9890.90 --> 9893.90
 I felt great.

823
9893.90 --> 9896.90
 My brain melted.

824
9896.90 --> 9903.38
 I thought it was like this.

825
9903.38 --> 9906.38
 I'm sorry for this.

826
9906.38 --> 9910.38
 If you come over here, it's like this.

827
9911.38 --> 9913.38
 Stop it.

828
9913.38 --> 9915.38
 No, no.

829
9916.38 --> 9918.38
 It's a big one.

830
9929.98 --> 9931.98
 It smells, doesn't it?

831
9935.67 --> 9939.67
 I feel like I'm here to take a shower, too.

832
9939.67 --> 9941.67
 That's right.

833
9943.67 --> 9967.89
 Do you want to take a shower together?

834
9968.89 --> 9970.89
 Yes.

835
9970.89 --> 9976.10
 It's like a couple.

836
9977.10 --> 9981.10
 Is that a bad thing to say if you're not a couple?

837
9981.10 --> 9984.10
 It's a bad thing.

838
9984.10 --> 9988.10
 I've never had this kind of experience.

839
9989.10 --> 10024.19
 I'll take a shower first.

840
10024.19 --> 10046.38
 Wait a minute.

841
10047.38 --> 10067.38
 Is this really the last time?

842
10068.38 --> 10077.45
 That's right.

843
10077.45 --> 10163.86
 One more time.

844
10273.28 --> 10278.19
 I feel good.

845
10484.67 --> 10486.67
 I feel good.

846
10503.79 --> 10507.74
 I feel good.

847
10508.74 --> 10510.74
 I feel good.

848
10611.60 --> 10629.99
 Let's do something more serious.

849
10639.47 --> 10641.47
 Put your hands here.

850
10645.00 --> 10647.00
 Put your hips out.

851
10649.38 --> 10651.38
 Let's do more.

852
10827.86 --> 10829.86
 I feel good.

853
10829.86 --> 10831.86
 I feel good.

854
10835.65 --> 10837.65
 I feel good.

855
10968.82 --> 10981.29
 I feel good.

856
10981.29 --> 10983.29
 I feel good.

857
10985.29 --> 11010.87
 I feel good.

858
11019.83 --> 11030.63
 I feel good.

859
11030.63 --> 11032.63
 I feel good.

860
11182.58 --> 11194.85
 Please don't do that.

861
11194.85 --> 11196.85
 I'm sorry.

862
11197.85 --> 11199.85
 I'm sorry.

863
11199.85 --> 11204.76
 Please don't do that.

864
11228.18 --> 11238.18
 I'm sorry.

865
11240.18 --> 11276.58
 I'm sorry.

866
11292.10 --> 11304.31
 I'm sorry.

867
11313.30 --> 11322.47
 Do you smell like a gentleman?

868
11322.47 --> 11324.47
 It stinks.

869
11324.47 --> 11365.54
 I'm sorry.

870
11365.54 --> 11369.54
 I thought you smelled like a gentleman, but it was this.

871
11369.54 --> 11377.25
 You're getting a little brighter.

872
11382.52 --> 11384.52
 What was that?

873
11384.52 --> 11386.52
 I don't know.

874
11386.52 --> 11389.52
 I was absorbed in it.

875
11436.78 --> 11440.78
 I'm getting lighter.

876
11441.78 --> 11443.78
 It's gone.

877
11443.78 --> 11445.78
 Why?

878
11446.78 --> 11449.78
 It's because it's morning.

879
11449.78 --> 11452.78
 It's light, so you don't need electricity.

880
11467.06 --> 11469.06
 I have one last request.

881
11471.06 --> 11474.06
 Can you smoke a cigarette?

882
11475.06 --> 11479.66
 I'm sorry.

883
11479.66 --> 11569.04
 You're getting brighter and brighter.

884
11574.59 --> 11580.89
 Are you glad you didn't go home?

885
11580.89 --> 11584.89
 I'm too late to go home.

886
11584.89 --> 11589.90
 I have to go home soon.

887
11590.90 --> 11592.90
 Do you?

888
11594.90 --> 11596.90
 Let's go home after you smoke this.

889
11596.90 --> 11615.36
 I don't want to smoke when you raise your hand.

890
11617.36 --> 11621.74
 Why do you always smoke?

891
11621.74 --> 11631.88
 If I finish smoking, it's over.

892
11631.88 --> 11673.46
 That's right.

893
11673.46 --> 11677.46
 Do you have a baby boy or girl?

894
11677.46 --> 11684.18
 I'm trying not to have a baby.

895
11687.18 --> 11745.70
 Are you in a pinch from tomorrow?

896
11745.70 --> 11756.43
 I'm getting farther and farther away.

897
11758.43 --> 11762.43
 If I'm too close, I might remember it again.

898
11763.43 --> 11767.43
 I think it's better to be away from you.

899
11767.43 --> 11775.65
 I'm glad you're doing this.

900
11776.65 --> 11778.65
 I'm lonely.

901
11778.65 --> 11813.13
 I'm in trouble.

902
11813.13 --> 11815.13
 It's not good to smoke any more.

903
11815.13 --> 11817.13
 Yes.

904
11817.13 --> 11854.91
 I hope you'll be happy.

905
11854.91 --> 11865.20
 You too.

906
11865.20 --> 11901.41
 Let's take a shower.

907
11901.41 --> 11927.99
 In the middle of the night.

908
11992.76 --> 11996.97
 It's hot, so be careful.

909
11996.97 --> 12002.39
 How's work?

910
12003.39 --> 12007.39
 It's calmer than before.

911
12007.39 --> 12009.39
 I'm glad.

912
12009.39 --> 12014.39
 I'm not as late as I used to be.

913
12025.15 --> 12027.15
 Mr. Ooki?

914
12027.15 --> 12031.15
 I moved before I said hello.

915
12031.15 --> 12034.85
 What kind of person was he?

916
12034.85 --> 12036.85
 I don't know.

917
12037.85 --> 12040.85
 When I left the veranda the other day,

918
12040.85 --> 12042.85
 I smelled a cigarette.

919
12042.85 --> 12044.85
 I think it's the same as Hikaru.

920
12044.85 --> 12051.14
 Is that so?

921
12051.14 --> 12053.14
 It doesn't matter.

922
12053.14 --> 12055.14
 I can make time.

923
12055.14 --> 12057.14
 Let's go on a trip.

924
12057.14 --> 12059.14
 Let's go abroad.

925
12059.14 --> 12063.22
 That's good.

926
12063.22 --> 12066.22
 It's cold, so let's go inside.

927
12066.22 --> 12068.22
 That's right.

928
12068.22 --> 12072.22
 I'm looking for a place to smoke in the plane.

929
12072.22 --> 12074.22
 Is there such a place?

930
12074.22 --> 12076.22
 I don't think so.

931
12076.22 --> 12079.22
 It's cold, so let's go inside.
