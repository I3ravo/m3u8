1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,060
Good morning.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,830
Today, I'm going to
introduce you to a couple.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,280
I want you to take a look at her.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
Yes.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,171
As I said earlier, the
contents are detailed.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Yes.

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,510
Excuse me.

9
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,850
Can I ask you a question?

10
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,030
Yes.

11
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,510
Do you know the couple kisser?

12
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,170
No, I don't know.

13
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,670
You don't know?

14
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,908
It's a place where couples
meet and exchange

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,510
girlfriends and do
something a little erotic.

16
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,930
Have you been
there? No, I haven't.

17
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,450


18
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
You haven't, have you?

19
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,690
Do you have an interest
in such a place? I see.

20
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,750


21
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,290
It's suspicious, isn't it?

22
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,410
But I want you to experience the
atmosphere and give me a comment.

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,710
Of course, you don't have to
exchange or do anything erotic.

24
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,070
Of course, we will pay the full price.

25
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,870
I want you to experience the atmosphere.

26
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,330
If you have any comments, that's fine.

27
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,250
Do you have time?

28
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,930
How long will it take?

29
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,050
It will end in about 30 minutes.

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,850
What should I do?

31
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,390
You two look good together.

32
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,130
What's the difference?

33
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,350
About three months ago.

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,450
Yes.

35
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,990
At a club.

36
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,810
At a club?

37
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,430
Yes.

38
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,690
That's unexpected.

39
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,010
Yes, it is.

40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,150
How close are you?

41
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,070
Well, just a little.

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,630
I see.

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,810
You two are close, and
it's only been three months.

44
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,010
I don't think you have any complaints.

45
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,390
Well... Do you have
any? No, not really.

46
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,490


47
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,670
No? That's good.

48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,790
Do you have any? I don't.

49
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,290
I don't know.

50
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,111
Oh, you don't know.

51
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,050
What is it?

52
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,410
What is it?

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,450
I don't talk about other men.

54
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,250
I don't know anyone at all.

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,250
Oh, that's hard.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,410
That's because she believes in it.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,810
Oh, because she believes in it.

58
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,230
But you think you're
not attractive, don't you?

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,210
No, I don't think so at all.

60
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,610
Really?

61
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,310
Really?

62
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,490
I'm going back to the topic.

63
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,890
Is it OK?

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,310
I want to be a reporter
for the general public.

65
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,930
Like a date that is a
little different from usual.

66
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,750
I wonder if it's fun.

67
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,450
If you do it, I'll give you a gift.

68
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,150
Can you do it?

69
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,290
Do you want to try it?

70
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,830
Can you do it? Well, yes.

71
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,650


72
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,590
Thank you very much.

73
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,530
I'll explain it.

74
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,130
It's a program like an amateur reporter.

75
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,290
It's a program like that.

76
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,730
It's a program where amateurs go to
various shops and report their impressions.

77
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,010
This time, it's a project
called Couple Kissa.

78
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,290
Is it okay? Yes, it's okay.

79
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,370


80
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,470
Thank you very much.

81
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,690
I'm going to try it.

82
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,830
I want to try it too.

83
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,210
Go ahead.

84
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,650
I'm sleepy.

85
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,310
I didn't sleep well.

86
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,910
It's fun, isn't it? It's fun.

87
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
It's good.

88
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,650
It's good.

89
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,950


90
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,630
He said he wouldn't be sad.

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm not sad.

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,600
I believe in you.

93
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I believe in you.

94
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
I believe in you.

95
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,910
Do you have a strange
feeling about your boyfriend?

96
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,010
Because he is a man?

97
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,990
No, I don't think so.

98
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
Show me.

99
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,390
I don't feel anything.

100
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,470
Look at me.

101
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,990
Do you have a crush
on him? No, I don't.

102
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,391
I'm not looking at you.

103
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,110
You don't care, do you?

104
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,250
I'm not looking at you.

105
00:05:52,251 --> 00:06:02,830
Q. How old are you now?

106
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,810
A. I'm 20.

107
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,890
Q. Are you sure?

108
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:06,891
A. Yes, I am.

109
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,070
Q. Do you watch MMA?

110
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,370
A. Yes, I do.

111
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,270
A. No, I don't.

112
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:18,271
I don't come here often, but I don't
come here often while looking at this.

113
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,330
What is this?

114
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,710
What's wrong?

115
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,790
I don't usually do this.

116
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,130
He is shy.

117
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,150
He is cute.

118
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,410
I can see his nose.

119
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,010
You want to see it, don't you?

120
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,270
I'm looking at it.

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,550
I think you can see it.

122
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,090
You're wearing a woman's clothes.

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,070
You're wearing a woman's clothes.

124
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,270
It's cute.

125
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,130
You're really a woman.

126
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,050
You're a woman.

127
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,530
If you could just say that
you'll participate in the event.

128
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,290
No.

129
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,870
I'll leave that to you.

130
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,690
Everyone is excited.

131
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,790
Isn't it too early?

132
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,790
What are you talking
about? It's too early.

133
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,790


134
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,810
You're a woman,
aren't you? I'm a man.

135
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,110


136
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,290
It's your first time
to come here, isn't it?

137
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,890
Yes.

138
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,110
You don't have to be careful at all.

139
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,990
You don't have to be like this.

140
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,430
You've come all the way here.

141
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,910
You've come all the way here.

142
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:12,911
It's normal.

143
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,610
You don't have to be afraid.

144
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,430
Look.

145
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,590
Oh, it's fast.

146
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,670
It's not fast.

147
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,470
It's fast.

148
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,780
It's like a robot.

149
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,420
It's fast.

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,780
It's like a robot.

151
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,100
It's like a robot.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
You don't have to be shy.

153
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
It's my room.

154
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
It's okay.

155
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,520
It's your first time,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

156
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860


157
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:36,020
We don't have a microphone.

158
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's use a small one.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Microphone, microphone.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,080
You are a great father.

161
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
Please turn on the microphone.

162
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,510
It's just a memory.

163
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,250
I found it.

164
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,450
I found it.

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,650
You two seem to have made a mistake.

166
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,930
What?

167
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,680
What are you doing?

168
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
You should come here.

169
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,680
Yes, you should come here.

170
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
That's right.

171
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,120
You should come here.

172
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,140
Did you teach me how to play?

173
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:54,440
How to play?

174
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,220
Please teach me how to play.

175
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,760
Hey!

176
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:59,660
You can come over here.

177
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
I'm trying to run away.

178
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,180
Can I touch you? No, you can't.

179
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,680


180
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
You look mature.

181
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
I'm not.

182
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,240
I'm not.

183
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm not fat.

184
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,700
You're not fat.

185
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,020
What if the groom comes?

186
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,740
I'll be like, I'll be
like, I'll be like,

187
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,580
I'll be like,

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
You should come this way.

189
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,480
No, no, no.

190
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,580
This way, this way.

191
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,140
You should come this way.

192
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,676
What should I do if you come this way?

193
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
You should come this way.

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,680
You should come this way.

195
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,680
Do you have any plans to have sex?

196
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,420
Can you make it
come true? No, I can't.

197
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,440


198
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,160
You can't make it come true? Are
you seeing someone? No, I can't.

199
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,320
Do you have any
plans? No, not yet.

200
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,180


201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,220
You don't have a neck, do you?

202
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,750
I don't have a neck.

203
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,270
Really?

204
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,330
I'm a little seduced by adult play.

205
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,410
Isn't this crazy?

206
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,390
Why are you touching me?

207
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,290
Don't you have any complaints?

208
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,430
No.

209
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,770
Girls are sexier than you think.

210
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,910
I don't know what kind
of shoes you are wearing.

211
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:17,850
You said you don't have a voice actor.

212
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,670
Don't be scared, everyone.

213
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,950
Sit down, sit down.

214
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,790
Show me your face.

215
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,080
I'll lower the chair in front of you.

216
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,900
I'll sit in front of you.

217
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,700
No, no, no.

218
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Here.

220
00:13:48,020 --> 00:14:09,850
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,050
No.

222
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,270
You are really kind, aren't you?

223
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,690
Yes.

224
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,570
You are.

225
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,230
You are.

226
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,990
You are.

227
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:24,690
You are.

228
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:25,691
You are.

229
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,290
You are.

230
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:37,770
You are.

231
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:38,851
It's not noticeable, is it?

232
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,550
On the contrary, it's not noticeable.

233
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,970
Look at it closely.

234
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,890
Is it not noticeable?

235
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,710
It's the first time to hear
the sound of the microphone.

236
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,130
How do you feel? I'm sorry.

237
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:01,730
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,070
I'm surprised.

239
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,850


240
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,950
Your face is surprisingly calm.

241
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,890
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm getting stiff.

243
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,970
Your eyes are wobbly.

244
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,070
Your eyes are wobbly.

245
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,690
Can you hear my
voice? I'm sorry.

246
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,960
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,740
I love you.

248
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:26,800
I love you.

249
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,081
I want you to look at
me in a beautiful way.

250
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,800
You're a girl, aren't you?

251
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,380
You're a girl, aren't you?

252
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,920
You're a girl, aren't you?

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:04,350
You're a girl, aren't you?

254
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,330
Are you going to eat it?

255
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:22,890
You are eating too much.

256
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,970
Do you want to poop?

257
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,310
You don't want to, do you?

258
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,950
You don't have to poop as a man.

259
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:39,080
This is the first time for me to meet you.

260
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,281
Oh my god! It's the first
time for me to meet you, too.

261
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Hello.

262
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,800
Are you really not
the worst? No, I'm not.

263
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,861
There is no such a thing.

264
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,140
There is no such a thing.

265
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
I'm not a human.

266
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Look at this.

267
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
It's suspicious.

268
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
It's like being touched by a goldfish.

269
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
It's terrible.

270
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
It's terrible.

271
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,000
My boyfriend has gone crazy.

272
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
What? It's a lie.

273
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,960
It's a lie.

274
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500


275
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
It's terrible, isn't
it? Look at this.

276
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,840


277
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
Wow!

278
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,050
He's gone crazy.

279
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,980
He's gone crazy.

280
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,320
After all, men are like this.

281
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,500
Look at this.

282
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
He says it's super cute.

283
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,020
I thought so.

284
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,180
Stop it.

285
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,520
You wanted to see
it, didn't you? I did.

286
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200


287
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,700
It's cold in Japan.

288
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:05,920
It's cold.

289
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
Look down.

290
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,670
It's cold.

291
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:22,790
It's a little bit scary.

292
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,410
It's scary.

293
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,670
It's scary.

294
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,190
I have been waiting for you all the time.

295
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,030
Thank you.

296
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,330
You have a long hair.

297
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,750
Hair is so long.

298
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,890
I am surprised.

299
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,270
Why?

300
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:44,970
You are so cute.

301
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,630
Do you have a boyfriend?

302
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,390
She has already got up.

303
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,890
She has already got up.

304
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,610
She has already got up.

305
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,611
She has already got up.

306
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,590
It's beautiful, isn't
it? Look at that.

307
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,390
It's beautiful.

308
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,830
I know.

309
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:11,970
It's clean.

310
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,150


311
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,250
It's a facial make-up.

312
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,190
It's amazing.

313
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,990
No, I don't know.

314
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,990
It's amazing.

315
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:27,810
It's amazing.

316
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,290
It's been a while since we did this.

317
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,750
You look like a teenager.

318
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,350
It's soft.

319
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,050
Ah!

320
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,510
It's a little big.

321
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,710
You want to forget, don't you?

322
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,510
It's a little different
from what I'm saying.

323
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,590
It's terrible, isn't
it? It's terrible.

324
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,090


325
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,030
I'm going to cry.

326
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,370
No, no, no.

327
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,330
I'm about to cry.

328
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,480
Have you ever heard of it?

329
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,070
No.

330
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:56,870
I'm going to cry.

331
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,410
You don't usually cry, do you?

332
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,610
No, because I can't
hide it even if I can see it.

333
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,370
Wait a minute.

334
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,150
Let's leave her alone.

335
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,350
OK.

336
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,590
Let's get in the way.

337
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,450
Don't look at her.

338
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,830
Don't look at her.

339
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,590
Don't look at her.

340
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,690
Don't look at her.

341
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:21,691
OK.

342
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,090
I like boobs.

343
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,370
She likes boobs, too.

344
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,710
You look flat.

345
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,150
How do you feel? I'm not flat.

346
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,480


347
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,120
To be honest, my body is flat.

348
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,700
You don't have to worry about it.

349
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,920
It's OK.

350
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Leave it to me.

351
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
What's going on?

352
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
It's being played.

353
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
Ah!

354
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Hey!

355
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,760
What are you
doing? It's a success.

356
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120


357
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
It's not that easy.

358
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,520
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,561
I think I'm going to lose.

360
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,780
I think I'm going to lose.

361
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:34,400
Mom, is it okay?

362
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm going to lose.

363
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Oh, well.

364
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm going to lose.

365
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,540
I've lost five minutes.

366
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,860
How was it?

367
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Well,

368
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,680
I think I need to concentrate.

369
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:07,681
I don't think so.

370
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Really? I'm happy.

371
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,820


372
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Are you happy?

373
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,620
You have a good one.

374
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
No, I don't.

375
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,020
It's not bad.

376
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
It's good.

377
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
This is good.

378
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,160
Do you want to pull up?

379
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes.

380
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,060
What are you doing?

381
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,940
What are you doing?

382
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
I'm going to show you my body.

383
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,620
I'm going to show you my body.

384
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:39,821
I'm going to show you my body.

385
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
It's a round.

386
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
It's wide.

387
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,040
Your style is perfect.

388
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:14,880
Let's use it.

389
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:23,820
This is the first time I've ever
seen such a scene in a movie.

390
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:33,280
It's like a scene from a horror movie.

391
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:41,060
It's the first time I've ever
seen such a scene in a movie.

392
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,421
It's the first time I've ever
seen such a scene in a movie.

393
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,380
It's the first time I've ever
seen such a scene in a movie.

394
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Oh,

395
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh? Let's have fun.

396
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:17,570


397
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,690
Women have sexual desire.

398
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,510
But they don't know women's sexual desire.

399
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,930
Oh, It's so tight.

400
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,510
But I'm happy.

401
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,270


402
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,510
You're wearing a warm bag.

403
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,510
You look like a girl, don't you?

404
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,326
You look like a girl, don't you?

405
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:50,650
You look like a girl, don't you?

406
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:50,850
You look like a girl, don't you?

407
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,046
You look like a girl, don't you?

408
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,206
You look like a girl, don't you?

409
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,930
You look like a girl, don't you?

410
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,750
You look like a girl, don't you?

411
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,910
You look like a girl, don't you?

412
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,330
You look like a girl, don't you?

413
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,850
You look like a girl, don't you?

414
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,010
You look like a girl, don't you?

415
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,210
You look like a girl, don't you?

416
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,090
I have to play with it.

417
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,870
I know, you have to play with it.

418
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,510
I have to look at it.

419
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:43,720
It's not good.

420
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,820
I can't stop it.

421
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I can't stop it.

422
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,700
She's gone.

423
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
She's gone.

424
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
She's gone.

425
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
She's been killed.

426
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,420
She's been killed.

427
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,020
How is it?

428
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:24,180
I'm going to do it.

429
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:44,180
I'm going to do it.

430
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm going to do it.

431
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,900
I'm going to do it.

432
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,360
Do you want me to do
what you want me to do?

433
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,800
No, I want you to do what I want you to do.

434
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
That's rude.

435
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,600
It's beautiful, but it feels different.

436
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,160
There is such a world.

437
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,100
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

438
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:57,180
It is a derivative work
of the Touhou Project.

439
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,060
It is a derivative work
of the Touhou Project.

440
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,061
I'm glad to see you two.

441
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,870
You look pitiful.

442
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
You look totally fine.

443
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:36,505
You are completely immersed in the world.

444
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,100
It's painful, isn't it?

445
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,220
It's painful, isn't it?

446
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,700
It's a real man's love.

447
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
It's strange, isn't it?

448
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
It's strange, isn't it?

449
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,550
It's strange to be able to do it normally.

450
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,220
It's intense.

451
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
It's intense.

452
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,580
She is so tired.

453
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,740
She is so happy.

454
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,120
You look so happy.

455
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,060
You look so happy.

456
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,061
You look happy.

457
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,680
You are a man if you
don't give this kind of things.

458
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,280
Yes, I am.

459
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,281
Oh, I see.

460
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
It feels good.

461
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,360
Do you want me to carry you on my back?

462
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:30,180
Do you want me to carry you
on my back? On your back.

463
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,290


464
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,390
It's a little bit hot.

465
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,710
It's hot.

466
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,770
I'm hot.

467
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,650
You are hot?

468
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,390
I'll bring you a tissue.

469
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,210
I'll bring you a tissue.

470
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
I'm hot.

471
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,550
I'm hot.

472
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,150
It's hot.

473
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,670
You should take off your clothes.

474
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:10,671
What's going on?

475
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,170
There are so many of them.

476
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
They are so cute.

477
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,410
Excuse me.

478
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,450
Are you free now?
We are shooting around here.

479
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:35,970
What is this?

480
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:37,190
What is this program?

481
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,873
It is a program where
amateur reporters go to

482
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:49,290
various shops and talk
about their impressions.

483
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,510
Sounds interesting.

484
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,850
I'm interested in it.

485
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,410
Could you tell me your name?

486
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,411
May I ask your name? I'm Shiori.

487
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,450


488
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,090
And your boyfriend? I'm Ken.

489
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,510
Shiori and Ken.

490
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,850


491
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,990
Thank you very much.

492
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,090
May I ask your age? I'm 22.

493
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,430
I'm 23.

494
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,790


495
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,810
You are 22 and I'm 23.

496
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,230
You seem to be one year apart.

497
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,710
Where did you meet each other?

498
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:26,481
I'm a college student,
too. I graduated from the

499
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:30,670
university a year ago, but
I'm a college student now.

500
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,510
Are you both college
students? Yes, we are.

501
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,510
Do you have any dissatisfaction
with each other? Yes, we do.

502
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,110


503
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,070
What do you feel?

504
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,210
He is a little jealous.

505
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:45,490
Jealous? Yes, he is.

506
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,970


507
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,150
I think he is a little too much.

508
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:52,670
What do you do?

509
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,530
What do I do?

510
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,730
It's embarrassing if I don't say it.

511
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,390
I don't like to say it.

512
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,620
How do you do? Do you keep it a secret?

513
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,430
I don't think I know much about it.

514
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:07,750
You don't?

515
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,751
No.

516
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,870
Do you have any complaints
about your boyfriend?

517
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:15,831
Do you have any
dissatisfaction with the company?

518
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,910
Even if I send an e-mail, they don't reply.

519
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,970
I think they don't like it.

520
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,710
Is it a temptation to
reply quickly? Yes, it is.

521
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,570


522
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,350
I will tell you briefly.

523
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,351
I introduce this time.

524
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,510
This is a program called
assault amateur reporter.

525
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,490
Amateurs go to a place
called a couple cafe.

526
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,390
They enjoy there.

527
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,231
After that, they comment on the impression.

528
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,170
It is a program of such content.

529
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,450
What is a couple cafe?

530
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:55,451
What is a couple cafe?

531
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,590
What is a couple cafe?

532
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,704
A couple cafe is a place
where a lot of couples gather

533
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:03,990
and exchange their partners
to do something erotic.

534
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,310
Exchange partners?

535
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,230
But we don't exchange partners.

536
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,130
We just want you to see the atmosphere of
the place and talk about your impressions.

537
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,950
You don't have to go to college today.

538
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,310
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

539
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,310
Here you are.

540
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,270
Thank you.

541
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,610


542
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,920
It's amazing,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

543
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,640
How do you feel? I'm nervous.

544
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,940


545
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,620
I've never been to such a place.

546
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm nervous.

547
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm nervous.

548
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Please sit down.

549
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,640
We are reporters.

550
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,560
So, please tell us what
you want to talk about.

551
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,940
Is there anything you want to talk about?

552
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,760
Please take your time.

553
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,360
You look happy.

554
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,440
Thank you.

555
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,780
I'm so happy to see you.

556
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,180
I'm so happy to see you, too.

557
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,980
How often do you go
to Kansai? Once a week.

558
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,800
Once a week?

559
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,240
Yes, once a week.

560
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,440
I'm so happy to see you.

561
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:43,561
I don't know if I can do it.

562
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,860
Do you want to do it?

563
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,500
Like this? Yes, I do.

564
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,240
But it's difficult, isn't it?

565
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,200
If you don't mind, I'd
like you to mix it up.

566
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,940
But it's just a little bit.

567
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,290
Yes.

568
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
It's just the atmosphere.

569
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,660
It's okay.

570
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,020
It's okay, isn't
it? Yes, it's okay.

571
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:09,320


572
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
I've never seen a place like this.

573
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
It's my first time.

574
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
It's very active.

575
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,420
There is a floor for adults.

576
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,680
I've never seen a place like this.

577
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,740
Is this a cover?

578
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,500
Yes.

579
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,100
It's a cover.

580
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Oh, it's hot.

581
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,840
It hurts.

582
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,860
It's hot.

583
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
It's hot.

584
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
It's hot.

585
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,220
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

586
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:38,340
It is a derivative work
of the Touhou Project.

587
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Let's start.

588
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,520
Wow! I'm nervous.

589
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Wait a minute.

590
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,720
Wait a minute.

591
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,980
I'm nervous.

592
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180


593
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,180
You are nervous.

594
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
Are you okay?

595
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,000
We are going to do our best.

596
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,180
Please support us.

597
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,420
Please support us.

598
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,520
Please support us.

599
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,040
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

600
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,900
It's been a long time.

601
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,800
It's beautiful.

602
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,520
Could you take a look at it?

603
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,240
What do you think? It's so cute.

604
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,960
It's too far away.

605
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,740
It's like a wall of my heart.

606
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,720
I want to enjoy it.

607
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,260
You want to enjoy it, don't you?

608
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,920
It's interesting.

609
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,860
How do you feel?

610
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:30,861
It's my first time.

611
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
Oh, is it? Please come in.

612
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
Please come in.

613
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,220
I'm nervous.

614
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,300


615
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,920
Let's participate.

616
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Yes, let's.

617
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,640
What's up?

618
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,620
What are you doing here?

619
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm here to have fun.

620
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,620
What are you here to have fun?

621
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:53,940
I'm here to have fun.

622
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,280
I'm here to have fun with FIT.

623
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:56,640
I'm looking forward to it.

624
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
I don't know until I try it.

625
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,600
It's better to go there
to feel the atmosphere.

626
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,680
It's boring just to watch it.

627
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,360
It's like a flower of the wall.

628
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,720
There is no need to say bad words.

629
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Just do it.

630
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,620
We are like brothers.

631
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,620
It's amazing.

632
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,900
Is it amazing? This is normal.

633
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,000
This is normal.

634
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720


635
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,240
Do you come here every
week? Yes, every day.

636
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,460


637
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,580
Do you know each other?

638
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,160
Yes, we know each other.

639
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,800
Are you a naked couple?

640
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,040
It's like a family.

641
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,280
It's like a family, isn't it?

642
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:00,900
It's like a family, isn't it?

643
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:16,960
It's like a family, isn't it?

644
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:17,620
It's like a family, isn't it?

645
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,080
It's like a family, isn't it?

646
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:18,920
It's like a family, isn't it?

647
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:19,380
It's like a family, isn't it?

648
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:21,020
It's like a family,
isn't it? I'm nervous.

649
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,440
I'm nervous.

650
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,540
Your face is stiff.

651
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,980
I'm nervous.

652
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,500
How do you usually
feel? I'm nervous.

653
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm nervous.

654
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040


655
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,560
Can I change my clothes today?

656
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:48,561
Are you ready?

657
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,340
No, I just came here for sightseeing.

658
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
For sightseeing?

659
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,120
Yes.

660
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,900
What's that?

661
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:56,901
What's that?

662
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
Isn't that a camera?

663
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Anyway,

664
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,440
she's my girlfriend.

665
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,680
If you don't
mind... But, well...

666
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,220
That's normal.

667
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,780
It's a secret scene.

668
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020
That's right.

669
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Yes!

670
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,980
You can hold it in, can't you?

671
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,100
Don't growl like that!

672
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,560
She doesn't like it, does she?

673
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,280
She's jealous, so she
doesn't want to get up.

674
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
She's drooling a bit.

675
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,140
No, no.

676
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,520
Don't get jealous.

677
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,921
You have to overcome your jealousy.

678
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,980
You have to change your attitude.

679
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,880
You have to change your attitude.

680
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,000
You don't have to touch your boobs.

681
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,520
You don't have to do that.

682
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,140
Let me change my attitude.

683
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,800
Please don't do that.

684
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,280
Why?

685
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,220
You just have to change your attitude.

686
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:02,221
You can't say that.

687
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,720
I'm in a good mood.

688
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,120
You should say,

689
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,940
I'm in a good mood.

690
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,220
You like my best girlfriend, don't you?

691
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:13,781
You like my best girlfriend, don't you?

692
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,380
You are so cute.

693
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,900
I'm not.

694
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm not.

695
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,020
You are cute.

696
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,900
She said, yes.

697
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,420
I see.

698
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,940
She is a good girl.

699
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,660
I think it's going to be fun.

700
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
I think it's going to be fun.

701
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,140
You are so small.

702
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,020
If you are a man, you should play with it.

703
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,560
What are you
talking about? Stop it.

704
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,540


705
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,560
This is not a toy.

706
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,020
It's amazing that you don't touch it.

707
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,000
I told you not to touch it.

708
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:55,780
Don't touch me.

709
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm naked.

710
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,380
Don't touch me.

711
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,780
I want my girlfriend to touch me.

712
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,160
I have a bad feeling about this.

713
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:10,161
I'll get touched, too.

714
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,180
I'll get touched, too.

715
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:13,880
Please touch me.

716
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,260
She doesn't look good.

717
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,540
What are you doing?

718
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,541
Hey!

719
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,040
Could you give me a moment?

720
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:23,280
Mr. Kuroda.

721
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,260
I'm sorry to bother you.

722
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,840
This is not the one, this is not the one.

723
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,600
You, you, you.

724
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:33,601
Wait, wait, wait.

725
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,620
This is a serious business.

726
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
You should play a little.

727
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,780
I'm not sure.

728
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
Don't do anything.

729
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,820
It's a little hard.

730
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,480
You're right, Mr. Kuroda.

731
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,020
Wait a minute, please.

732
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,000
I can't believe I'm
living in a place like this.

733
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,340
I'm a serious person,
so please don't touch me.

734
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,180
Why are you touching me?

735
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,380
My hands are in the way.

736
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,000
Don't attack me.

737
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,760
Why are you touching me?

738
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,400
Please stop touching me.

739
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,260
You're smiling.

740
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,340
I'm not smiling. I'm just rubbing my hands.

741
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,120
No, I'm not.

742
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,900
She looks like she's having fun.

743
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,100
Yeah, she is.

744
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:24,540
She's having a lot of fun.

745
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,040
I think she's having the
most fun out of all of us.

746
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,580
Wait a minute.

747
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,900
You've come this far, and
you're being so persistent.

748
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,660
Don't touch me.

749
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,220
I'm going to break that flow.

750
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,200
Wait, wait, wait.

751
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,940
Touch me.

752
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
It's okay.

753
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,120
Don't push your boobs against my face.

754
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:47,180
Please stop it.

755
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,240
Please stop it.

756
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
Please stop it.

757
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Please stop it.

758
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,200
Please stop it.

759
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,640
Please stop it.

760
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,100
Stop it.

761
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,860
Why are you angry?

762
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,700
It's not the place to be angry.

763
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,620
Please stop it.

764
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Stop it.

765
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,400
They are arguing.

766
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,040
I'm being told that I'm amazing.

767
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,300
Why are you messing with me?

768
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
Let's have a fight.

769
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,660
I'm looking forward to it.

770
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,820
You're very strong.

771
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,920
I'm not good at this.

772
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,140
That's right.

773
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,240
I'm scared.

774
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,460
I'm scared.

775
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,760
You're quite strong.

776
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:39,761
Are you okay?

777
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I want to eat it.

778
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,800
You want to eat it, don't you?

779
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,860
What are you doing?

780
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
You are a bad girl.

781
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
It's good.

782
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,600
It's amazing, isn't it?

783
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,020
It's definitely the light of boobs.

784
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,720
It's so red.

785
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,640
It's so cute.

786
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,980
It's the image of boobs, isn't it?

787
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,860
It's the image of boobs.

788
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:06,520
It's the image of boobs.

789
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,961
You look like you are from Hokkaido.

790
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,880
This hand is mine.

791
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,900
You are persistent.

792
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,260
Stop it.

793
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
No one is persistent.

794
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,460
You resist.

795
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,260
I don't want to resist.

796
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,460
You don't want to
resist, so you don't resist.

797
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:26,461
You don't resist.

798
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,140
You always resist.

799
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,620
When you were in ATC, you resisted.

800
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:33,500
What's this?

801
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:34,680
It's an old one.

802
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,260
What's this? Oh, no.

803
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,320
It's broken.

804
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
Yes, it is.

805
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,240
Let me see your hand.

806
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:46,241
It's broken.

807
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,800
It's broken.

808
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:48,980
Let me see your hand.

809
00:47:48,981 --> 00:47:50,900
What's this? It's all red.

810
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
It's broken.

811
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:54,280
It's all red.

812
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:55,281


813
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,120
Do you have a
new one? Yes, I do.

814
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,400
I have a new one.

815
00:47:59,480 --> 00:47:59,920
Thank you for coming today.

816
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:01,280
Thank you for coming to our date.

817
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,740
She is a female gyu.

818
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,020
So, she is a bit old.

819
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,820
Wait a minute.

820
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,660
Wait a minute.

821
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,180
Red panties.

822
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,100
She is a bit old.

823
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Raise your hips.

824
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Wait a minute.

825
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,800
What are you
doing? Wait a minute.

826
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,940


827
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
She is not a baby.

828
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Great.

829
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Wait a minute.

830
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,760
I'm so happy!

831
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:28,761
Please don't touch me.

832
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
I'm so happy!

833
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,880
Oh, you touched me.

834
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,140
Why did you touch me?

835
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,780
I'm so happy!

836
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,100
Oh!

837
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,020
You look so happy.

838
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,420
You look so happy.

839
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,480
You're so into it.

840
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,860
You're so into it.

841
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:54,880
You're so into it.

842
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,920
No, no, no.

843
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,720
You like it, don't
you? No, I don't.

844
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,020


845
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,820
What are you talking about?

846
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,060
What are you touching? Stop it.

847
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,260
Red underwear.

848
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800


849
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,360
Hey.

850
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,660
What are you doing? Stop it.

851
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640


852
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,460
Hey.

853
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,740
Are you OK?

854
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,320
You always stay in your room, don't you?

855
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,580
It's hard to breathe.

856
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,880
This is the world of the lung.

857
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Why are you standing up?

858
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm standing up.

859
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,040
Are you standing
up? No, I'm not.

860
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,360


861
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,640
I'm standing up.

862
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,580
I'm standing up.

863
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,120
I'm standing up.

864
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,080
No, you're not.

865
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Can you make it
bigger? I don't know.

866
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,040
This is a serious person,
but this is not good at all.

867
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,500
It's different from what I've heard.

868
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,460
It's true.

869
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,280
I didn't know that.

870
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,120
You are standing so much.

871
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,540
What are you doing?

872
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,580
You are standing so much.

873
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,560
Well, well.

874
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,220
What are you doing?

875
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,500
What are you doing?

876
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,120
What are you doing?

877
00:50:20,121 --> 00:50:21,121
What are you
doing? I'm so jealous.

878
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,360


879
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,580
Where?

880
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,640
Here, here, here.

881
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Please put it on.

882
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
Can I?

883
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,140
What are you doing?

884
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,960
You don't have to do it.

885
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
You don't have to do it.

886
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Stop it.

887
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,980
Stop it.

888
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:38,460
I'm fine.

889
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,040
I told you not to do it.

890
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,940
What are you doing? Stop it.

891
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,300


892
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,540
I'm not doing it.

893
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,860
Her hair style is very feminine.

894
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,160
What are you doing?

895
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:43,920
Why did you shut up?

896
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,680
Why are you so quiet?

897
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,840
You don't like it, do you?

898
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,380
No.

899
00:51:48,381 --> 00:52:18,360
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

900
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:19,361
This is the toilet.

901
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:22,840
It is the toilet.

902
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,020
Don't do that.

903
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,440
I do the same thing.

904
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:44,580
I bind my hands.

905
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,140
Don't do that.

906
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,820
What are you
doing? Here you are.

907
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,960
Thank you.

908
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
Don't touch it.

909
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,520


910
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
I'm a little worried.

911
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,820
I'm a little worried.

912
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,700
No, I'm not.

913
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:17,480
I know, but you're holding my hand.

914
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,740
Don't touch me.

915
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Stop it.

916
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:29,950
How about this?

917
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:30,150
How do you feel? I don't know.

918
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,070


919
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:33,630
Why?

920
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,410
You feel good, don't you?

921
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,090
Let's go inside.

922
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,970
It's very spacious inside.

923
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,170
It's cold, isn't it? It's good.

924
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:50,300


925
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,310
Are you comfortable?

926
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,010
I don't know if I can move.

927
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,650
You don't know?

928
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:37,670
It seems that you are saying
that you feel comfortable.

929
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:39,870
I don't know.

930
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,871
I'm sorry.

931
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:42,630
Don't you feel good?

932
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,810
I don't know if I feel good or not.

933
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,530
Let's take a look.

934
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,450
I don't know.

935
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,890
But I feel good.

936
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,630
Let's take a look.

937
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:45,990
I'm cold.

938
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:52,740
I feel the pain of my wrist.

939
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,840
I'm getting worse.

940
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:25,180
I think I'm getting worse.

941
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm getting worse.

942
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:46,050
I'm getting more and more serious.

943
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:53,883
This is the first time
I've ever seen a cat like

944
00:56:53,895 --> 00:56:59,270
this, and I've never
seen a cat like this before.

945
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:01,886
I've never seen a cat like this before,
and I've never seen a cat like this before.

946
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:06,110
I've never seen a cat like this before,
and I've never seen a cat like this before.

947
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:07,390
What's up?

948
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,990
She is very attracted to you.

949
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,250
I'm sorry.

950
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,390
Sorry to keep you waiting.

951
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,730
Look this way.

952
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:30,870
Meow.

953
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,310
Meow.

954
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,510
Meow.

955
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,490
Meow.

956
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:40,190
Meow.

957
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,410
Meow.

958
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,370
I'm a deadbeat,
aren't I? You are.

959
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:49,930
I'm a deadbeat.

960
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,140


961
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,150
It's gonna work out.

962
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,510
Still a little
sluggish? That's right.

963
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,060


964
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,360
I guess you couldn't get over it.

965
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,650
I'm sorry.

966
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,510
I can't take it anymore.

967
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,630
But you're doing well,
aren't you? I'm a deadbeat.

968
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,270
He's got a tan.

969
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,470
He's got a tan.

970
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:16,930
He's got a tan.

971
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,250
He's got a tan.

972
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:18,670
He's got a tan.

973
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:18,870
He's got a tan.

974
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:18,890
He's got a tan.

975
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:18,950
He's got a tan.

976
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:19,951
He's got a tan.

977
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,110
He's got a tan.

978
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,370
He's got a tan.

979
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:21,670
He's got a tan.

980
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:22,170
He's got a tan.

981
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:22,550
He's got a tan.

982
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:23,990
He's got a tan.

983
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,330
He's got a tan.

984
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:30,690
He's got a tan.

985
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:30,870
He's got a tan.

986
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,050
He's got a tan.

987
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,450
He's got a tan.

988
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,170
He's got a tan.

989
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,511
Why?

990
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,340
How do you feel?

991
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,380
I don't feel good.

992
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,950
Why don't you do it yourself?

993
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,650
I'm doing it myself.

994
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,190
You didn't do it on purpose,
did you? No, I didn't.

995
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:04,190
I just felt good.

996
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:05,950
You don't feel good.

997
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,170
I felt good.

998
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,850
I don't know.

999
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,070
I don't know.

1000
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,730
What do you know? I don't know.

1001
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,110


1002
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:16,810
Naked? No, no, no.

1003
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,510


1004
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:33,690
Can you tell me your
name? I'm Osami.

1005
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,270


1006
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:35,970
Mr. Osami.

1007
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,450
What about your
boyfriend? I'm Lee.

1008
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:37,810


1009
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:38,790
Mr. Lee?

1010
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:39,310
Yes.

1011
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:40,790
Aren't you
Japanese? No, I'm not.

1012
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,130
I'm from Korea.

1013
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,470


1014
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,430
Are you Korean?

1015
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:45,970
Yes.

1016
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,430
Are you studying
abroad? Yes, I am.

1017
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,850
Are you a college student?

1018
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:50,590
Yes.

1019
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,330
Do you have a part-time job?

1020
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,290
I have a part-time job at a gas station.

1021
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,550
Gas station?

1022
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:55,850
Yes.

1023
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:56,710
That's good.

1024
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,190
Thank you.

1025
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,570
What about your girlfriend?

1026
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,510
She is a student at a vocational school.

1027
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:03,150
She is a student at a vocational school.

1028
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,190
Where did you meet her?

1029
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,410
We met at a drinking
party about two months ago.

1030
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:10,530
At a drinking party.

1031
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,770
Is it a group
marriage? Yes, it is.

1032
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,010
I see.

1033
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,630
I haven't asked your age yet.

1034
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:17,770
How old are you?

1035
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,410
I'm 22 years old.

1036
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,490
22 years old.

1037
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:21,710
How old are you?

1038
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,050
About the same age.

1039
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:23,430
I'm in my twenties.

1040
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,170
Twenties.

1041
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,430
Yes.

1042
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,070
You seem to get along well.

1043
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,910
Yes, we do.

1044
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,130
Do you have any dissatisfaction
with each other? No, we don't.

1045
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,310
No, we don't.

1046
01:00:35,311 --> 01:00:36,330
No, we don't.

1047
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:38,590
No, we don't.

1048
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,030
No, we don't.

1049
01:00:43,031 --> 01:00:43,050


1050
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
Where did you like her?

1051
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,950
She is kind to everyone.

1052
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,550
Kind?

1053
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,330
She is friendly.

1054
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,690
She looks kind.

1055
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,230
Yes, I like her.

1056
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,080
Did you confess your
love to her? Yes, I did.

1057
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,750


1058
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,530
I'm glad that you have
such a cute girlfriend.

1059
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:10,310
I'm shooting for a program
called Tatsugeki Shirooto Reporter.

1060
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,788
The content is that
amateurs go to various shops

1061
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,790
and get their impressions
and comments at the end.

1062
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,490
This time, I'm going to a couple's cafe.

1063
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:28,870
Do you know a couple's cafe?

1064
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,730
No, I've heard of it.

1065
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,170
How did you hear of it?

1066
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,330
A cafe where couples go.

1067
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:41,370
A cafe where couples go.

1068
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,510
That's right.

1069
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,090
I don't know the details.

1070
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,430
A lot of couples come together.

1071
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,230
They exchange partners.

1072
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,730
They do erotic things and play.

1073
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,850
It's a cafe like that.

1074
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,490
You've never been there,
have you? No, I haven't.

1075
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,710


1076
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,270
Are you interested in it? Well.

1077
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,670
..

1078
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,850
No, never.

1079
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,410
Never? That's good.

1080
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:08,770
You are very active.

1081
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,750
How about your boyfriend?

1082
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:13,930
I've never seen him.

1083
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:14,950
You've never seen him?

1084
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:15,210
Yes.

1085
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,370
Are you interested
in him? A little bit.

1086
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,650
A little bit?

1087
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,890
You look like a pervert.

1088
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:23,909
It is a program that I would like
you to stay in the store for about

1089
01:02:23,921 --> 01:02:28,070
30 minutes and look at the atmosphere
and comment on your impressions.

1090
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,050
Is it okay? Can
you do it? I see.

1091
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,210


1092
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:38,170
Yes.

1093
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,230
Is it okay just to look at it?

1094
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:49,350
I don't have to exchange it, but I want
you to enjoy the atmosphere of the place.

1095
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:54,550
This time, we will go to the playroom.

1096
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:01,118
I want you to go to
the place where such a

1097
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:05,270
thing has started and
give us your impressions.

1098
01:03:05,271 --> 01:03:06,870
If I can, I'd like to do it.

1099
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:09,070
Do you really just watch it?

1100
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,910
Yes, I just watch it.

1101
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,470
If I'm invited to do something,

1102
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,290
I just refuse to do it.

1103
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,010
Really?

1104
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:22,150
Yes.

1105
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,530
You just watch it?

1106
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:25,430
Yes, I just watch it.

1107
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,750
I don't ask you to change anything.

1108
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:31,090
Of course, I make a joke.

1109
01:03:31,091 --> 01:03:35,550
We will also release a
video, so I hope you can do it.

1110
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,970
You have a subtle look on your face.

1111
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,790
I just look at it.

1112
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,550
I just look at it.

1113
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,864
I just look at it, but
all the customers are

1114
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:58,050
ordinary people, so
they come to enjoy it.

1115
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,939
I'm a person who lives in Tokyo,
so I might come close to you,

1116
01:04:00,951 --> 01:04:03,710
so I'd like you to take good
care of yourself in that area.

1117
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,170
Are you okay?

1118
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:13,230
If you have a strong will and
refuse, I think it's okay at all.

1119
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:15,790
I'm just looking at you.

1120
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,510
Can you refuse?

1121
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:17,870
Yes.

1122
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,510
I can't rely on you.

1123
01:04:19,511 --> 01:04:20,511
I'm nervous.

1124
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,750
Are you OK?

1125
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:27,830
Yes.

1126
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,370
Can you do it?

1127
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,050
I just have to look at it.

1128
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,430
Here it is.

1129
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,610
Can you wear it?

1130
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:38,550
Yes.

1131
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,290
Thank you.

1132
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:42,930
How do you feel? I'm nervous.

1133
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:49,920
My heart is pounding.

1134
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,820
Your boyfriend is also nervous.

1135
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:12,900
How do you feel?

1136
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,260
It's embarrassing.

1137
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,820
It's embarrassing,
isn't it? I'm sorry.

1138
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,940


1139
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,480
I think I'm more stressed out than you are.

1140
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:32,960
I'm sorry.

1141
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:40,740
I'm sorry.

1142
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,580
You two are reporters.

1143
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,540
We're not here anymore.

1144
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,440
Are you okay?

1145
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,820
Can you do some interviews?

1146
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,240
What?

1147
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
Can you do some reports?

1148
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,220
Reports?

1149
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:57,780
Yes.

1150
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Come here.

1151
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Well,

1152
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:04,640
Yes.

1153
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,940
Can you do some
interviews? Well, please.

1154
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,520
You are already there.

1155
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,900
I can see you from a distance.

1156
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:10,580
Yes.

1157
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,900
Please.

1158
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,940
What are you doing here?

1159
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,780
What are you doing here?

1160
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,620
This is a private school.

1161
01:07:12,435 --> 01:07:14,140
Don't you know anything?

1162
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,440
Do you know the system?

1163
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,480
It's my first time.

1164
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
Oh, is that so?

1165
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,340
This is a place to release yourself.

1166
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,340
I don't know if my girlfriend
is different from yours.

1167
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:28,480
Hello.

1168
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,180
Hello.

1169
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,560
It's no problem.

1170
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,340
Hello.

1171
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,140
Hello.

1172
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,300
It's hot, isn't it? It's hot.

1173
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:15,870
Hello.

1174
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,820


1175
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,500
It's getting hot.

1176
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,500
What are you going to do?

1177
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,560
She seems to be motivated.

1178
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,400
If she wakes up, she will
be switched to this side.

1179
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,680
It's a rule.

1180
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,280
This is the first time for you, isn't it?

1181
01:08:52,281 --> 01:09:00,860
How do you feel?

1182
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,580
My heart is beating so fast.

1183
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,240
How do you feel? I'm fine.

1184
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,620
I'm fine.

1185
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,180
Well, let's go to bed.

1186
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,540
Is this your first
time? Yes, it is.

1187
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,620


1188
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,340
It's good, isn't it?

1189
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,180
Is it your first time to have a boyfriend?

1190
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:27,460
Is it your first time to
have a boyfriend? Yes, it is.

1191
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,060


1192
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,440
You look so energetic.

1193
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:31,900
No, I'm not.

1194
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,020
You look so energetic.

1195
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,940
You look so energetic.

1196
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:34,980
You look so energetic.

1197
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:35,020
You look so energetic.

1198
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:39,920
You look so energetic.

1199
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,420
You look so energetic.

1200
01:09:45,421 --> 01:09:48,900
I will go to the vet.

1201
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:55,200
I'm worried about my daughter's health.

1202
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:00,920
I'm afraid to carry her.

1203
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:04,520
I'm worried about her.

1204
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,620
I'm worried about her.

1205
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,940
I'm worried about her.

1206
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,300
I'm worried about her.

1207
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:39,750
This is the first time I've ever seen
a baby crying in front of a camera.

1208
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:43,470
The baby is crying.

1209
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:46,470
The baby is crying.

1210
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:47,790
The baby is crying.

1211
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,450
The baby is crying.

1212
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:58,930
I don't get it.

1213
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:04,690
Boo!

1214
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,250
How about hearing none?

1215
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,490
Reading none?

1216
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,130
It seems to be reading none.

1217
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,930
I don't know about this.

1218
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,250
What does it say? Disgusting.

1219
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:29,030
The baby is crying.

1220
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:38,170
It's hot, isn't it?

1221
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,150
The baby is crying.

1222
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,450
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

1223
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:49,346
I'm not sure if it's because
it's cold or because it's cold.

1224
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:53,770
I'm not sure if it's because
it's cold or because it's cold.

1225
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,050
I'm not sure if it's because
it's cold or because it's cold.

1226
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:14,870
I'm not sure if it's because
it's cold or because it's cold.

1227
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:16,950
Ouch!

1228
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,410
Are you OK?

1229
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,590
What's wrong?

1230
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,190
What's wrong? I'm fine.

1231
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,150
I'm fine.

1232
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,370
I'm fine.

1233
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:35,650
I can't help it.

1234
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:35,950
I can't help it.

1235
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,430
I can't help it.

1236
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,190
I can't help it.

1237
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,770
I can't help it.

1238
01:12:44,771 --> 01:12:48,290
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying so loudly.

1239
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,530
I'm so happy.

1240
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:02,930
I'm so happy.

1241
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,390
I'm so happy.

1242
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,650
I'm so happy.

1243
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,370
I'm so happy.

1244
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,750
I'm so happy.

1245
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,751
I'm sorry.

1246
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,230
Please let go of me.

1247
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,230
Let go of me.

1248
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:23,870
You are doing well.

1249
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:25,430
You are doing well.

1250
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:28,330
You are touching her.

1251
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:30,930
You are touching her.

1252
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:37,280
You are touching her.

1253
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,920
Everyone is embarrassed.

1254
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:44,080
I'm sorry.

1255
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,180
I'm so embarrassed.

1256
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,150
What are you going
to do? Don't cry.

1257
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:13,400
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

1258
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:24,980
It's been a while since I've
seen a baby crying like this.

1259
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:25,981
She is so small.

1260
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,680
She is so cute.

1261
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,260
She is being petted.

1262
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,980
How do you feel? She is so cute.

1263
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,160


1264
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,420
She is so young.

1265
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,820
She is so energetic.

1266
01:14:49,821 --> 01:15:00,240
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

1267
01:15:08,265 --> 01:15:09,700
I'm so happy to see a baby cry like this.

1268
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:09,840
I'm so happy to see a baby cry like this.

1269
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,520
I'm so happy to see a baby cry like this.

1270
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:39,240
I'm so happy to see a baby cry like this.

1271
01:15:39,241 --> 01:15:40,660
You're not hurt? No, I'm fine.

1272
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:41,940


1273
01:15:48,620 --> 01:16:15,490
You're not hurt? No, I'm fine.

1274
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:31,760
You don't have a tumor?

1275
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,390
You don't have a tumor?

1276
01:16:33,391 --> 01:16:34,730
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1277
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,270
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1278
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,890
Actually, I've never done this before.

1279
01:16:41,891 --> 01:16:42,390
I've never done this before.

1280
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:43,590
I've never done this before.

1281
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:44,711
I've never done this before.

1282
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,910
Can you do it with your hands and feet?

1283
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:56,410
No.

1284
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:57,930
I can't do it.

1285
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:18,310
Dad is crying.

1286
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:58,980
Ten years have passed
since my daughter was born.

1287
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,900
I am going to die.

1288
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,160
I can do it.

1289
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,580
I can do it.

1290
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,600
This is...

1291
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,760
There are so many!

1292
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:19,100
I can't believe it.

1293
01:18:19,101 --> 01:18:20,101
It's cute, isn't it?

1294
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,280
This is my girlfriend.

1295
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,140
Wow.

1296
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,100
How old are you?

1297
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,640
70.

1298
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:42,520
It's hot.

1299
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,060
It's cold.

1300
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,420
It's cute.

1301
01:18:51,421 --> 01:18:52,421
I'm sorry.

1302
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
It was good.

1303
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,940
I won't do it again.

1304
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,640
I don't know.

1305
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't know.

1306
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:19,210
Can you tell me
your name? I'm Kenji.

1307
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:21,430


1308
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,170
What about your girlfriend?

1309
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:38,250
She's away from you.

1310
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,530
That's good.

1311
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,370
How did you get to know each other?

1312
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:49,630
He was a friend of my younger brother.

1313
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,990
Is he your younger brother's
classmate? Yes, he is.

1314
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:53,530


1315
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,110
That's how you got to know each other.

1316
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:57,670
You are so close.

1317
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,170
Do you have a crush
on him? Yes, I do.

1318
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,910


1319
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:06,090
I have a crush on him.

1320
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,770
I have a crush on him.

1321
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:09,830
I have a crush on him.

1322
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,960
Well... I don't
want you to hear it.

1323
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:29,820
I feel like I'm treated like a child rather
than a woman because we are friends.

1324
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:32,120
I see.

1325
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,820
I'm away from him.

1326
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:38,861
If you are away from him when
you are 10 years old... I've done it.

1327
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,670
What?

1328
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,280
What do you think of your boyfriend?

1329
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,460
I don't have a boyfriend.

1330
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,160
He is young.

1331
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,460
He is young.

1332
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:55,680
He has a lot of male friends.

1333
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,920
He has a lot of male friends.

1334
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,300
He has a lot of male friends.

1335
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:01,100
He has a lot of male friends.

1336
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:05,400
I think he is playing with them.

1337
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,920
He has a lot of male friends.

1338
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:10,220
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1339
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,160
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1340
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:15,000
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1341
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:15,460
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1342
01:21:15,461 --> 01:21:18,280
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1343
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,900
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1344
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,580
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1345
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:28,520
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1346
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,600
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1347
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:35,740
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1348
01:21:35,741 --> 01:21:36,380
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1349
01:21:36,381 --> 01:21:37,900
I don't like it, but I don't play with it.

1350
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,640
This is a program called Shirooto Reporter.

1351
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,680
You've never seen it,
have you? No, I haven't.

1352
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,360


1353
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,320
Shirooto Reporter.

1354
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,080
Shirooto Reporter.

1355
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,380
You don't know it?

1356
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:54,480
It's a program in which an
amateur goes to a lot of shops,

1357
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,280
and gets their feedback
and comments at the end.

1358
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,220
I don't want to say anything weird.

1359
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:04,221
I don't expect it.

1360
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,540
Do you know about couple kisser?

1361
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,500
I don't know in detail.

1362
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,000
I've heard only the name.

1363
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,420
I don't know the content.

1364
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,500
I don't know.

1365
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,560
We just enjoy the atmosphere of the place.

1366
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,760
You don't have to exchange.

1367
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,440
You don't have to do anything special.

1368
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,780
That's right.

1369
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,560
Visiting ceremony.

1370
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:31,620
Visiting ceremony.

1371
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,200
A little bit? A little bit.

1372
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,560
Thank you.

1373
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,600


1374
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,900
How do you feel?

1375
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,500
I came to this cafe.

1376
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,880
What is this?

1377
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:47,600
What is this?

1378
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:48,780
This is the place.

1379
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,880
Is this a place for people who live alone?

1380
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,500
Yes, this is the place.

1381
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,920
What is the reason?

1382
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,140
Because this is a cafe.

1383
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:06,120
I'm a doctor, so I have to
eat, right? No, you don't.

1384
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,360


1385
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,180
It's a place where you can play.

1386
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,900
I think it's a place like that.

1387
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,061
It's a little different from my image.

1388
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,600
What kind of image do you have?

1389
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,940
I don't have such an image.

1390
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,540
You don't, do you? I'm not sure.

1391
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:26,960
I don't know.

1392
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,760
I'll call you.

1393
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:30,900
I'll call you.

1394
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:31,740
I'll call you.

1395
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:32,640
I'll call you.

1396
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:32,900
I'll call you.

1397
01:23:32,901 --> 01:23:33,901


1398
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,140
Let's try a different way.

1399
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Okay.

1400
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,720
If you like, you can go to the doctor.

1401
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,100
No, I don't want to.

1402
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:45,900
Let's ask him.

1403
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:46,520
You two.

1404
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,440
Let's ask him how he feels.

1405
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:51,290
I'm sorry.

1406
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:51,920
I'm sorry.

1407
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,120
I'm sorry.

1408
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:59,560
The seat over there is big, so
maybe you two can sit over there.

1409
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,340
It's okay.

1410
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:03,300
I'm not going to do anything,
but I'm going to sit next to you.

1411
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,840
It's okay.

1412
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:14,620
My favorite actress is my girlfriend.

1413
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,840
I'm not your girlfriend.

1414
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,180
I'm your girlfriend, too.

1415
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,040
I think that's the purpose.

1416
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,041
This is the best.

1417
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:24,920
This is the best.

1418
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,660
Do you want to
touch it? No, no, no.

1419
01:24:27,661 --> 01:24:29,300
Sit down.

1420
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:30,580


1421
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,960
Why?

1422
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,320
Do you want to touch it?

1423
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:39,995
Me?

1424
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,540
Do you want to
touch it? This is yours.

1425
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,860


1426
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,420
I know you don't like it.

1427
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:49,660
It's okay if you don't touch it.

1428
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,320
Are you okay?

1429
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:52,700
Let's do it together.

1430
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,100
No, I'm fine.

1431
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,200
I'll put it on your shoulder.

1432
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,440
Wow, it's big.

1433
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,440
You should touch it carefully.

1434
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,840
You don't know what it is.

1435
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,360
It's very elastic.

1436
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,560
It's amazing.

1437
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,240
It's beautiful.

1438
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:14,800
I'm sorry.

1439
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:15,520
I can't touch it.

1440
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:16,521
Can I touch you?

1441
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,900
Do you want to touch
this side? No, it's OK.

1442
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,000


1443
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,580
How do you feel sitting here?

1444
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,440
I feel comfortable.

1445
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:32,220
Do you feel comfortable?

1446
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,540
How about you?

1447
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,380
I feel comfortable.

1448
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,460
I feel comfortable.

1449
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:46,461
This is the place.

1450
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,080
Good morning.

1451
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,360
Let's get up.

1452
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,460
No, no, no.

1453
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,380
No, no, no.

1454
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:00,381
It's OK.

1455
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,500
Sutan.

1456
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,140
No, no, no.

1457
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,520
Yes.

1458
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,180
She is also like a type.

1459
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,260
She is angry.

1460
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:07,440
She is throwing her right hand.

1461
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,040
She is angry.

1462
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:10,380
She wants to go.

1463
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,560
I'm not throwing her.

1464
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:11,820
She wants to go.

1465
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:12,620
No, no, no.

1466
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:14,800
I'll try it.

1467
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,600
I'll try it.

1468
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,240
Don't do that.

1469
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:28,240
Don't care about me.

1470
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,740
I'm not doing it because I'm tired.

1471
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,480
The excuse.

1472
01:26:36,481 --> 01:26:37,760
What is that?

1473
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,940
Wow!

1474
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,340
I couldn't see it.

1475
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:42,740
It's a sardine.

1476
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,680
It means it's very popular today.

1477
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,320
Yes, it is.

1478
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,740
It's a sardine.

1479
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,280
It's a sardine.

1480
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,740
It's easy to use.

1481
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:00,540
It's easy to use.

1482
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:03,040
It's easy to use.

1483
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,520
It's easy to use.

1484
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:04,900
It's easy to use.

1485
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,460
It's easy to use.

1486
01:27:06,461 --> 01:27:08,720
Don't look at me. I'm doing it by myself.

1487
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:11,210
Did you see that?

1488
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,940
Do you know that?

1489
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,280
She is wearing a tight-fitting clothes.

1490
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:18,920
Yes, she is.

1491
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:22,280
It's different from a striped shirt.

1492
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,660
Then, I'll wear a suit.

1493
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:25,661
Then, I'll wear a jacket.

1494
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:35,440
I'll wear a jacket.

1495
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,400
It's hard, isn't it?

1496
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,600
You're a normal person.

1497
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,440
You don't usually do
this, do you? No, I don't.

1498
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,560
How is it? It's normal.

1499
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,340


1500
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,520
Is this normal? No, it's not.

1501
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,620
I'm sorry.

1502
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,040
I'm sorry.

1503
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,720
I'm sorry.

1504
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,160
I'm sorry.

1505
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:52,500
I'm sorry.

1506
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:52,560
I'm sorry.

1507
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,040
I'm sorry.

1508
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:53,980
I'm sorry.

1509
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:54,140
I'm sorry.

1510
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:54,480
I'm sorry.

1511
01:27:54,481 --> 01:27:54,520
I'm sorry.

1512
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:54,560
I'm sorry.

1513
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:55,900
I'm sorry.

1514
01:27:55,901 --> 01:27:56,140
I'm sorry.

1515
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,740
I'm sorry.

1516
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,980
I'm sorry.

1517
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,100
I'm sorry.

1518
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,400
He is a little stubborn.

1519
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,140
He is not good at touching his boobs.

1520
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:11,840
He is good at it.

1521
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:11,980
He is good at it.

1522
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,720
He is good at it.

1523
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:14,420
He is good at it.

1524
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:15,421
Please stop.

1525
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,620
He is a little docile.

1526
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,960
You like that.

1527
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,160
You like that.

1528
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,560
You are going to be a new experience.

1529
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:28,180
He is a little tired.

1530
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:30,940
I caught it by myself.

1531
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,460
I caught it by myself.

1532
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,420
Is it hard? It's hard.

1533
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,560
It's hard.

1534
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It's hard.

1535
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,180
It's hard.

1536
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,880
It's hard.

1537
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:45,160
It's hard.

1538
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:45,440
It's hard.

1539
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:47,140
It's hard.

1540
01:28:47,141 --> 01:28:47,760
It's hard.

1541
01:28:47,761 --> 01:28:48,220
It's hard.

1542
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:48,480
It's hard.

1543
01:28:48,481 --> 01:28:48,660
It's hard.

1544
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,680
It's hard.

1545
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,560
It's hard.

1546
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,580
It's hard.

1547
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,140
It's hard.

1548
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,200
It's hard.

1549
01:28:55,201 --> 01:28:56,201
It's hard.

1550
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:56,780
I'm sorry.

1551
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:57,781
Hey, help me.

1552
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,980
You're a man.

1553
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,480


1554
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,660
I can't help you.

1555
01:29:02,661 --> 01:29:03,661
I can't help you.

1556
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:05,660
Hey, stop it.

1557
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:10,400
There are a lot of people
who don't usually do this.

1558
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,121
In fact, I also run a company.

1559
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,960
After all, humans are balanced.

1560
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,256
I think it's good to have
various experiences.

1561
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,360
How is it?

1562
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:20,600
How is it? It's good.

1563
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,460


1564
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,020
I'm going to cry.

1565
01:29:24,021 --> 01:29:25,021
Let's do it.

1566
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,480
It's OK.

1567
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:34,520
Can you touch it?

1568
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:40,830
He is touching it.

1569
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,340
He is a grown-up.

1570
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,540
They seem to be having fun.

1571
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,840
No, it's not like that.

1572
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:14,280
It's like this when you put on
a tight suit and move a little.

1573
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:16,041
This is what it looks
like when you open it.

1574
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,380
Stop it, please.

1575
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,640
Stop it, please.

1576
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,740
Stop it, please.

1577
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:30,220
Stop it, please.

1578
01:30:30,221 --> 01:30:31,300
Don't put your chest out.

1579
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,630
Don't put your chest out.

1580
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,240
I'm putting it out.

1581
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:40,140
I'm going to borrow Kenji.

1582
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,700
No, no.

1583
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:44,120
Please come in.

1584
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,920
I'll wash my hands.

1585
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,560
Please sit down.

1586
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,280
Go to the next room.

1587
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,040
She is also a player.

1588
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,100
No, no, no.

1589
01:31:03,101 --> 01:31:03,640
No, no, no.

1590
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,760
Is this the place? No, no, no.

1591
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,540


1592
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,800
No.

1593
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
No.

1594
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:17,020
Haruka, Haruka, what
are you doing? It looks fun.

1595
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,340
Please stop it.

1596
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,020


1597
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,500
What's wrong with you?

1598
01:31:29,501 --> 01:31:30,541
Let's go to the new house.

1599
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1600
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:34,880
Bye-bye.

1601
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,960
Come in here.

1602
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:43,220
No, no, no.

1603
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,780
Lick it, lick it.

1604
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,760
Let's put our hands on the card.

1605
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,200
Do you want to do it?

1606
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,180
Let's put our hands on the card.

1607
01:31:51,181 --> 01:31:52,320
Put your hands on the card.

1608
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:53,580
Yes, yes, yes.

1609
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,160
You can do it like this.

1610
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,660
It's small.

1611
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,060
It's small, so I'm going to make it bigger.

1612
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,600
It's hard when it's a baby.

1613
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,200
It's big.

1614
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,920
It's big.

1615
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,600
This is good.

1616
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,700
It's amazing.

1617
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,080
What are you doing? Stop it.

1618
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,560
Don't do that.

1619
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,320


1620
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,640
Don't be peaceful.

1621
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,340
Let's have sex in love and peace.

1622
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:31,840
That's right.

1623
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,080
Let's end in peace.

1624
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:34,880
No, no, no.

1625
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,760
Let me go first.

1626
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:37,620
No, no, no.

1627
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:38,880
You just let me go.

1628
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,100
Let me talk to you.

1629
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,360
I'm going to sleep.

1630
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,120
No, no, no.

1631
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:45,560
I'm going to sleep.

1632
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:46,260
I'm going to sleep.

1633
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,860
I'm going to sleep.

1634
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:48,780
No, no, no.

1635
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,480
I'm going to sleep.

1636
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:54,700
I'm going to sleep.

1637
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,580
It's hard, isn't it? Stop it.

1638
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:05,310


1639
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,220
Because the size is different.

1640
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,180
How do you feel to be seen by such a woman?

1641
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:16,540
In the hot gaze of a woman.

1642
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:17,500
Scary.

1643
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:18,501
I'm scared.

1644
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,250
I told you I'm scared.

1645
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,700
Stop it.

1646
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,080
It's hard, isn't it?

1647
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:28,760
But it feels good.

1648
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,420
It's not fun.

1649
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,720
It's different.

1650
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:45,580
I made him laugh.

1651
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:47,860
That was my aim.

1652
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,500
Is that so?

1653
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,960
This is my hobby.

1654
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,610
What are you doing?

1655
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:20,640
She is shaking her head.

1656
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:23,040
I want you to touch her.

1657
01:34:23,845 --> 01:34:26,240
Then, I will touch her boobs.

1658
01:34:32,495 --> 01:34:35,700
What are you doing?

1659
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,020
You are not injured, are you?

1660
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,340
I've never touched a girl.

1661
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,040
How can you touch her?

1662
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:49,780
I've never touched her.

1663
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,060
I've never touched her.

1664
01:34:52,805 --> 01:34:53,805
Her legs are not bad.

1665
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,080
What's wrong?

1666
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,200
What's this?

1667
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,340
What's this?

1668
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,660
You are not injured.

1669
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,540
It's not dirty.

1670
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:09,820
It's not dirty.

1671
01:35:12,235 --> 01:35:14,480
It's difficult.

1672
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,110
It's difficult.

1673
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,720
I can't hide it.

1674
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,640
What does it look like from behind?

1675
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,220
I want to see it.

1676
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:29,100
Light on.

1677
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,160
It's made of aluminum.

1678
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,400
It's open.

1679
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:35,401
I was surprised.

1680
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,520
You were surprised?

1681
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:38,920
You didn't look at the
boobs, did you? Oh, it's soft.

1682
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:49,100


1683
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:58,820
You don't have a daily
life, do you? No, I don't.

1684
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,220


1685
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,020
You don't have a daily
life, do you? He is cute.

1686
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,670
He feels good.

1687
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,140


1688
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,520
He is provoking.

1689
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:20,840
He is provoking.

1690
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:24,820
He is sleeping.

1691
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,840
Let's sleep here.

1692
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,260
Let's sleep side by side.

1693
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:30,351
At the end, I was able to see a baby
who had been crying since a while ago.

1694
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:37,220
I think this baby was
the first baby I've seen.

1695
01:37:37,315 --> 01:37:42,200
I was able to see a baby in a new home.

1696
01:37:47,940 --> 01:38:02,040
This is the first time for me.

1697
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,241
This is the first time for me.

1698
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:04,820
Good morning.

1699
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,300
These two are the oldest.

1700
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,780
What are you doing?

1701
01:38:16,055 --> 01:38:17,280
Are you crying? Yes, I am.

1702
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,120
I'm sorry.

1703
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:32,500
She is crying.

1704
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:44,410
She is crying.

1705
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:46,930
It's terrible.

1706
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:48,590


1707
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:51,110
It's really terrible.

1708
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:51,630
It's embarrassing.

1709
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,090
Do you remember this?

1710
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:59,650
Let's hug together.

1711
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:02,730
Let's hug together.

1712
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,120
It feels good, doesn't it?

1713
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:59,650
How many times are you saying it?

1714
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,610
Are you looking at it?
Are you looking at it?

1715
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:07,270
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

1716
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,670
I was surprised.

1717
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:12,150
Look, look.

1718
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:14,210
Can you see that?

1719
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:23,550
Wow, there are a lot of coins.

1720
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:25,170
A lot.

1721
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:34,220
Did you feel good?

1722
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,740
Did you feel good? I felt good.

1723
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,901
I was surprised.

1724
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,440
Oh, really?

1725
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,400
Do you like this scene?

1726
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,200
You can wear it again.

1727
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:44,960
It's funny.

1728
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:46,220
It's funny, isn't it?

1729
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,060
It's funnier than I thought.

1730
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,700
I'm addicted to it.

1731
01:40:50,701 --> 01:40:51,400
You're addicted to it.

1732
01:40:51,401 --> 01:40:52,401
I'm addicted to it.

1733
01:41:00,575 --> 01:41:01,736
Was it your first time today?

1734
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,280
Was it your first time?

1735
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,760
Yes, it was my first time.

1736
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,660
Did you have fun in front of people?

1737
01:41:06,661 --> 01:41:08,380
It was fun, wasn't it?

1738
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,360
At first, I was a little surprised.

1739
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,540
Everyone is like that.

1740
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,440
But it was fun.

1741
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:16,120
Really?

1742
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,480
And there were beautiful ladies.

1743
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,480
Was it fun to be
complimented? It was fun.

1744
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,330


1745
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,080
That's what she said.

1746
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,820
It was good, wasn't it?

1747
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,540
It seems that Kano-san was satisfied.

1748
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,840
It's fun.

1749
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:33,920
It's not fun.

1750
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,260
What are you doing?

1751
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:36,261
It was delicious.

1752
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:42,280
You two don't have the same values, do you?

1753
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:45,540
Do you keep this relationship?

1754
01:41:46,025 --> 01:41:49,160
If you come here, you
can play with many people.

1755
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,820
If I stay here, I'll go out.

1756
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,840
If I stay here, I'll go out.

1757
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,540
That's right.

1758
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,920
Do you want to do that?

1759
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:01,431
If you don't have the
same values, I don't care.

1760
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,020


1761
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:06,380
Can I take a picture of you?

1762
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:06,700
What?

1763
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:07,896
Can I take a
picture of you? Sure.

1764
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,920


1765
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,380
I'll take a picture of you later.

1766
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:10,920
Please.

1767
01:42:10,921 --> 01:42:12,820
If you don't like it, you can go home.

1768
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,560
No, thank you.

1769
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,240
Can I take a
picture of you? Sure.

1770
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:16,980


1771
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,020
I'll take a picture of you later.

1772
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,280
Please.

1773
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,896
I'll take a picture of you later.

1774
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:22,720
Take it off.

1775
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,100
Take it off.

1776
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,540
I'll take a picture of you.

1777
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:24,900
I'll take a picture of you.

1778
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:27,180
I'll take a picture of you.

1779
01:42:27,181 --> 01:42:27,420
I'll take a picture of you.

1780
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,606
I'll take a picture of you.

1781
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:29,940
I'll take a picture of you.

1782
01:42:29,941 --> 01:42:30,540
I'll take a picture of you.

1783
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,940
I'll take a picture of you.

1784
01:42:34,941 --> 01:42:37,780
I don't think it's good to be so close.

1785
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,916
I don't think it's good to be so close.

1786
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:43,100
Let's move closer.

1787
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:54,290
How was it today? I was jealous.

1788
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:57,970


1789
01:42:58,610 --> 01:43:00,830
You were jealous, weren't you?

1790
01:43:00,831 --> 01:43:02,151
You didn't have to come this far.

1791
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,630
I want to have a full house.

1792
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:06,670
Do you want a full house?

1793
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:06,910
Do you want me to do it?

1794
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:08,010
Yes.

1795
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:08,550
I see.

1796
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:10,631
You're the only one who's not having sex.

1797
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:11,470
Yes.

1798
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:12,610
I'm the only one.

1799
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,950
What do you want me to do?

1800
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,281
If you do your best today,
I'll give you a reward.

1801
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:19,350
What?

1802
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:20,890
Where do you like to be attacked?

1803
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:25,150
First of all, Kuri-chan.

1804
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,350
Oh, you want me to
attack Kuri-chan right away?

1805
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,920
No, not right away.

1806
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:29,770
Not right away?

1807
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:31,470
From here?

1808
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:32,710
Yes, from the neck.

1809
01:43:32,711 --> 01:43:33,711
I don't know.

1810
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,810
Open your mouth.

1811
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:39,330
Open your mouth.

1812
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:42,531
Where do you want me to lick?

1813
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:44,330
Where do you want
me to lick? Tell me.

1814
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:48,330


1815
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,790
Where do you want me to lick?

1816
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:54,791
Where? I don't know.

1817
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:59,350
I don't know.

1818
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:00,900


1819
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,750
Don't turn around.

1820
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:05,750
I don't know how to turn around.

1821
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:07,350
I don't know.

1822
01:44:07,351 --> 01:44:08,351
Like this.

1823
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:10,550
Put your feet together.

1824
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:11,210
OK.

1825
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:12,510
Where? Look.

1826
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,150


1827
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:18,230
There?

1828
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,810
Yes.

1829
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:20,010
How should I sit there?

1830
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:23,230
How should I sit
there? How? Like this.

1831
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:24,510
Here.

1832
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:27,770


1833
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:29,570


1834
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:31,990
Is it okay here?

1835
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:33,150
Yes.

1836
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:33,730
Like this?

1837
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:35,110
Yes.

1838
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,801
It's better if the stimulation is strong.

1839
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:42,711
Is it weak and strong now?

1840
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:44,310
It's just right.

1841
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:45,470
It's just right.

1842
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:46,830
Like this?

1843
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:48,430
Yes.

1844
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:03,950
It's getting a lot.

1845
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:38,390
What are you going
to say? You said it.

1846
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,250


1847
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,721
You said it 9 times, didn't you?

1848
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,290
How many times did you say it?

1849
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:55,150
How many times did you say it?

1850
01:45:55,710 --> 01:45:56,330
3 times? 3 times.

1851
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:56,910


1852
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:58,030
9 times? 4 times.

1853
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,110


1854
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:00,570
You said it 4 times, didn't you?

1855
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:14,630
Tell me the answer.

1856
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:20,660
Somehow.

1857
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:22,180
Somehow?

1858
01:46:24,445 --> 01:47:13,870
Can I roll over?

1859
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:15,570
Yes.

1860
01:49:15,485 --> 01:49:17,900
Your chest is very big.

1861
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,470
Can I roll over your back?

1862
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:03,850
Back?

1863
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:05,250
Back?

1864
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:06,330
Yes.

1865
01:51:07,405 --> 01:51:08,470
Your hair is very long.

1866
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:10,590
Is that so?

1867
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:21,990
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

1868
01:52:21,991 --> 01:52:22,991
It's very round.

1869
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:31,930
Can you lie on your back?

1870
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:37,510
Turn your butt this way.

1871
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:59,480
I'm sorry for the baby's crying.

1872
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:37,150
I'm sorry for the baby's crying.

1873
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:39,310
You are good at lying on your back.

1874
01:53:39,311 --> 01:53:40,311
You are so cute.

1875
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,610
Look at me.

1876
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:45,950
Look at me.

1877
01:53:51,340 --> 01:54:59,640
Do you feel good?

1878
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,060
Oh, you are going to cry.

1879
01:55:14,061 --> 01:55:15,061
Oh, no!

1880
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,280
Oh, no!

1881
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:28,260
This side is painful, too.

1882
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,340
Let me see your tongue.

1883
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:50,820
Oh, it came out a lot.

1884
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:01,770
Are you satisfied now?

1885
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:03,310
Yes.

1886
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:03,570
Really?

1887
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:04,870
Yes.

1888
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,760
Do you want me to touch you?
