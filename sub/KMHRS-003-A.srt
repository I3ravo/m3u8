00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hello everyone, I'm Waito Okoyama.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Today, I woke up at 7am and ate breakfast, toast and scrambled eggs.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I had a scramble egg.

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Today is the second day of shooting.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm very nervous.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I couldn't eat breakfast as much as usual.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's why my belly is swollen.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like always, I bought some gummies.

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is my first time eating gummies.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to try it.

27
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
It's sour.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's sour, but it's delicious.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to eat while the rain is going down.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I came here by train today.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:48,000
After all, when I ride a bicycle in the morning, the wind feels good, so it makes me feel good.

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It was going to rain, but it hasn't rained yet.

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybe she is a hale girl.

34
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I think it's time to go to sleep.

35
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you very much.

36
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's been a while since the last time I filmed a video, so I'm a little nervous, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it again.

37
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
From now on, it's the first day of the first half. I'm still a little nervous.

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The room is 2013.

39
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where is it?

40
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What kind of people are there?

41
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I still have a long way to go, so I have a lot of things to do.

42
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,740
Are you also wondering about the

43
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,320
wardrobes that that this is

44
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,420
uh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 3

45
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm going to sleep.

46
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,420
Hello.

47
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Hello.

48
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Please come in.

49
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
There is a sofa over there.

50
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
Oh, you took a picture.

51
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Yes, I took a picture.

52
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,420
This is your first time with me, isn't it?

53
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
Yes.

54
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Please introduce yourself.

55
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
Yes, please.

56
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,420
What is your name?

57
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,420
First of all, my name is Koiwa Ito.

58
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:34,420
I'm 19 years old and I'm going to university.

59
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Really?

60
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
Yes.

61
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Is school fun?

62
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,420
School is fun.

63
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
I see.

64
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
What about today?

65
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Today is summer vacation.

66
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Oh, now.

67
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Yes.

68
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
I see.

69
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,420
Can you study?

70
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,420
No, I'm not good at it.

71
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm just good at it.

72
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
How was the shooting last time?

73
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,420
I was very nervous last time.

74
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,420
But it was fun.

75
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Really?

76
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Yes.

77
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
I see.

78
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
It was your first time.

79
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Yes.

80
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,420
You were interested in the world of English, weren't you?

81
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Yes, that's right.

82
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,420
I didn't have much confidence in myself,

83
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,420
so I wanted to be confident.

84
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,420
I saw actresses on SNS.

85
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
You mean actresses on TV?

86
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,420
Yes, I was interested in them.

87
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,420
I see.

88
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Do you like girls?

89
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
Do you like watching cute girls?

90
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,420
I like watching cute girls.

91
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
You don't like race?

92
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:01,420
No, I like watching cute girls in videos and pictures.

93
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
I see.

94
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
Do you mean that most of the actresses are cute?

95
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Yes, they are very cute.

96
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
I see.

97
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,420
There are a lot of people who are on TV.

98
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
Are you interested in that?

99
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,420
I haven't thought about it yet.

100
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
You haven't thought about it yet?

101
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
You haven't thought about it yet?

102
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
You haven't thought about it yet?

103
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
I haven't thought about it yet.

104
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Do you have any dreams in the future?

105
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,420
I haven't decided yet.

106
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,420
I want to decide something in college.

107
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,420
While studying.

108
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,420
I see.

109
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,420
You still have a long way to go.

110
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Do you know what you're going to do today?

111
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Today...

112
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm going to do something erotic.

113
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
What kind of erotic thing?

114
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,420
I don't know much about it.

115
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,420
You didn't come here because you love erotic things, did you?

116
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
That's right.

117
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
What do you mean?

118
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:22,420
It's not that I like blood, but I don't feel like I'm feeling good about it.

119
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:31,420
I don't know if I'm feeling good about it, but I'm not sure if I'm feeling good about it.

120
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,420
That's what I thought.

121
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,420
After we broke up, I thought I'd try it on my own.

122
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Did you want to try it on your own?

123
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Yes.

124
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,420
But I didn't really know how to do it.

125
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,420
What did you think when you tried it on your own?

126
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,420
I didn't really know how to do it.

127
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Which do you prefer, S or M?

128
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Do you know S or M?

129
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
I do.

130
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,420
What is S?

131
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
What?

132
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
I don't know.

133
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
I don't know what it is.

134
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
What is S?

135
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
Sa...

136
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I don't know.

137
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Sa?

138
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
Sa...

139
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
What? I don't know.

140
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Sa-do.

141
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
It's not a name.

142
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
That's how it is.

143
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
That's not true.

144
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,420
It's a difference.

145
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
What about M?

146
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
M is...

147
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I think so.

148
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
I understand.

149
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Which one do you think it is?

150
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
I think it's M.

151
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
I don't think it's S.

152
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,420
I think so.

153
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
I think so.

154
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:07,420
I'm going to check the tube for the first time.

155
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,420
It's big.

156
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,420
Do you think it's big?

157
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
Yes.

158
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Am I wrong?

159
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Have you ever used this?

160
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:29,420
It's similar to the first one, but it was smaller.

161
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Oh, there's a bigger one.

162
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
This one.

163
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
It's this big.

164
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
Please look at it a lot.

165
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Please watch it a lot.

166
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Is it good for you?

167
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
It's good for me, thank you.

168
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Let me see.

169
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
Do you like it?

170
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
It's getting hot

171
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
It smells a little

172
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
It smells sour

173
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
I'm going to the bathroom, so come here.

174
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
It's getting bigger.

175
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
How is it?

176
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
It's okay.

177
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
I'll wipe it off.

178
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
It's so cute.

179
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
It's so cute.

180
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Have you ever been touched on the buttocks?

181
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
I haven't

182
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Why?

183
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
You're eating a little more

184
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
It was like you were waiting for me

185
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Wow, you're so cute

186
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Look at your hips.

187
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
Open your hips with your left hand.

188
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Open your hips more.

189
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Where are you looking now?

190
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
Look at your hips.

191
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
You don't like it?

192
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Look at your face in the mirror

193
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
You don't like it?

194
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
It's beautiful over there

195
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,420
It's a beautiful pink color

196
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:43,420
I'm going to give you an itchy smell.

197
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm sorry I made you cry.

198
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,420
I can't help it.

199
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm going to take a bath.

200
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,420
You have a big body.

201
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I'm going to take a bath.

202
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
What do you like about your body?

203
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
I don't know.

204
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
You have a good neck.

205
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Do you want a bath?

206
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
But I don't have any confidence.

207
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
What?

208
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
For example, do you like the shape of boobs?

209
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Yes.

210
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,420
You're standing still, aren't you?

211
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Do you have anything to do with love?

212
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
No, I don't.

213
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
I'm scared.

214
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
It's good, isn't it?

215
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Move your shoulders a little.

216
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
It's good, isn't it?

217
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,420
It's good, isn't it?

218
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,420
It's good, isn't it?

219
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
Can you do it more?

220
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Can you do it more?

221
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Can you do it again?

222
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
Please do it again

223
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
I'm sorry.

224
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,420
You look weird.

225
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,420
I know you're not feeling well.

226
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,420
I made a really good book.

227
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
Let's read it together.

228
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Have you ever taken your man's underwear off?

229
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
I haven't.

230
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
You haven't?

231
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
How is this bath?

232
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
It's very slippery.

233
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Please touch it.

234
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
It's very slippery.

235
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
This is lotion.

236
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Have you ever taken a bath like this?

237
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,420
No.

238
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
This is the first time I've taken a bath like this.

239
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
This is a whole body bath.

240
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,420
It hurts.

241
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,420
Don't you take a bath with a man?

242
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
I don't take a bath.

243
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,420
You don't take a bath with your boyfriend?

244
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
I've never taken a bath.

245
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
I see.

246
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,420
You took a bath with your father, didn't you?

247
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
I took a bath with my father.

248
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
How old were you?

249
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:47,420
When I was little, I was about 3 or 4 years old.

250
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,420
You don't take a bath with your father?

251
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
I don't.

252
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
Why?

253
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Why? I don't know.

254
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
I see.

255
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,420
How many people have you had so far?

256
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
One person.

257
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
Only one person?

258
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,420
How many people have you had so far?

259
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,420
Only one person.

260
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,420
I see.

261
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,420
Don't you have a lot of etchings?

262
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
No.

263
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
How many times have you done it?

264
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Not once or twice, right?

265
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,420
I don't know.

266
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Really?

267
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Then, you haven't done it yet.

268
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,420
I'll do it again.

269
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
It's too much.

270
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,420
It's been a long time since I've had a body bath, hasn't it?

271
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
That's right, that's right.

272
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
It feels good to be able to apply lotion, doesn't it?

273
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Yes, it feels good.

274
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,420
You're so beautiful when you're shining.

275
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Look this way and put your buttocks together.

276
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
I'm supporting you.

277
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
I'm going to massage your buttocks.

278
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
I'm supporting you.

279
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,420
I'm going to massage your buttocks.

280
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
I'm sorry.

281
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
Please help me.

283
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
I'm sorry.

284
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
I'm so tired

285
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Can you do it a little bit more?

286
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Yes

287
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
How is it?

288
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
It feels weird

289
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
It's hard even with just one

290
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Are you okay?

291
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
I feel good

292
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
I can't help it anymore.

293
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
This is the most important thing.

294
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
I'll give you the medicine for that.

295
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm sorry.

296
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
All right.

297
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
That's all.

298
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
I'll be waiting.

299
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
I'll be waiting for you.

300
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,420
I'll be waiting for you.

301
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
I'll be waiting for you.

302
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
I'll be waiting for you.

303
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
I'll be waiting.

304
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I'll be waiting for you.

305
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,420
I'll be waiting for you.

306
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,420
It's not over yet.

307
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,420
Look at me.

308
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,420
How do you feel?

309
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
I feel good.

310
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
It's not over yet.

311
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
I'm going to wipe it off.

312
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,420
I'm going to wash it off.

313
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
I'm going to wipe it off.

314
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,420
I'm going to wipe it off.

315
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Thank you.

316
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
Do you want me to wipe your face?

317
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
I'll wipe your face.

318
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,420
How is it?

319
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
It's good.

320
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
What?

321
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
It feels good.

322
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
It's hot.

323
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Is it hot?

324
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Yes, it's hot.

325
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,420
This is a carp.

326
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,420
Wow, it's moving a lot.

327
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,420
What kind of fish is this?

328
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,420
I don't know.

329
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,420
I don't know if it's big or small.

330
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
You don't know?

331
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
You can't do that.

332
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,420
You can't do that.

333
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
You can't do that.

334
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
Are you tired?

335
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
How do you feel?

336
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I feel good.

337
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
If you feel good, say you feel good.

338
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
How do you feel?

339
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Do you feel good?

340
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
I feel good.

341
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
If you feel good, say you feel good.

342
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Look at me.

343
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Come here.

344
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Come here.

345
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Put your feet here.

346
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Put your feet here.

347
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Open your mouth.

348
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Like you did before.

349
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
Say, please lick me.

350
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Please lick me.

351
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Look at me and say it.

352
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,220
I want you to lick me a lot.

353
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Where do you want me to lick?

354
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,420
Buttocks.

355
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
What? Buttocks?

356
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,420
Do you want me to lick your buttocks?

357
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
No, I want you to lick my buttocks.

358
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Which one?

359
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Please lick my buttocks.

360
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
It's dirty.

361
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,420
Do you want me to give you more?

362
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Do you understand?

363
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Yes

364
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
What are you doing?

365
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
I'm going to massage your butt

366
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
I'm going to massage your beautiful butt

367
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
I'm going to spread it

368
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,420
I can tell by the amount of salt.

369
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Look at me

370
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,420
Are you okay?

371
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Are you okay?

372
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,420
I'm sorry.

373
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
Are you okay?

374
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
I'm okay.

375
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
Are you okay?

376
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
I'm okay.

377
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,420
I'm sorry.

378
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
Do you want to eat this?

379
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
This is for you

380
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Do you want to eat this?

381
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
What does it taste like?

382
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,420
It tastes like...

383
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,420
It tastes like...

384
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Please lie down on your knees.

385
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Please lie down on your knees.

386
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
Please lie down on your knees.

387
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Please lie down on your knees.

388
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
Are you okay?

389
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,420
You look good.

390
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Is it good?

391
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,420
Make a good sound.

392
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,420
I'm going to take a nap.

393
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm going to take a nap.

394
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
I'm going to take a nap.

395
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
I'm sorry.

396
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
You're so kind.

397
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
You're not doing your job.

398
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
You should do your job.

399
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
how does it feel?

400
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,420
eww

401
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
eww

402
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,420
eww

403
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,420
how do you feel?

404
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,420
feel like

405
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
eww

406
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
eww

407
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,420
eww

408
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,420
how do you feel?

409
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,420
eww

410
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
eww

411
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,420
eww

412
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,420
eww

413
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
eww

414
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
What are you going to do?

415
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
What are you going to do?

416
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,420
What are you going to do?

417
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
No.

418
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,420
You're wet like this.

419
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Do you understand?

420
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,420
I understand.

421
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,420
Spread it out.

422
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
Don't look at me when I'm sleeping.

423
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,420
Don't look at me when I'm sleeping.

424
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,420
What's wrong with you?

425
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
I'm sleepy.

426
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
Come on, touch me.

427
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,420
What's wrong?

428
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
I'm shaking.

429
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,420
What are you going to do?

430
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,420
I want you to touch me.

431
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
Is it good?

432
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
It's okay, it's okay

433
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
Are you okay?

434
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
You're okay.

435
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,420
You're in a good mood.

436
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,420
How do you feel?

437
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,420
I feel good.

438
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,420
You feel good, right?

439
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Are you okay?

440
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
It's a mess.

441
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,420
Can I drop it?

442
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,420
Look.

443
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
It's a mess.

444
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,420
It's okay, it's okay.

445
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

446
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

447
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
It feels so good.

448
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,420
ーAre you okay?ー

449
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,420
ーHow are you?ー

450
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,420
ーI'm okayー

451
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,420
ーYou're okay?ー

452
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
ーWhy?ー

453
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,420
ーI need to see my family.ー

454
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,420
ーI have to see my parents.ー

455
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
ーI have to look after them.ー

456
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,420
ーYou are good at this.ー

457
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,420
ーI'm not a good daughterー

458
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,420
ーI'm not a good daughterー

459
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,420
ーAre you okay?ー

460
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,420
ーAre you okay?ー

461
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
ーAre you okay?ー

462
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I want to go to the bathroom, but I don't want to go to the bathroom, so I'm going to take off my clothes.

463
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,420
Where are you going to take it off?

464
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I'm sick.

465
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
Look over here.

466
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm sick.

467
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
Do you like it?

468
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,420
Where are you going to stand?

469
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,420
Let's do the other side, too.

470
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Let's do the other side, too.

471
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Yes, yes, yes.

472
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,420
You can relax now.

473
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
Good.

474
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,420
I want you to relax

475
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,420
I'm sorry.

476
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,420
Are you okay?

477
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,420
Yes.

478
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,420
Are you okay?

479
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,420
I'm sorry.

480
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,420
I'm sorry.

481
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,420
I can't do it anymore.

482
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,420
What?

483
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,420
What?

484
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,420
What is it?

485
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,420
It's tickling

486
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,420
Look at me

487
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,420
I'm going to sleep

488
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,420
Give me a cup of water

489
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,420
Let's go, let's go

490
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,420
Let's go

491
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,420
Oh, no

492
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,420
Oh, your mouth

493
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,420
Close your eyes.

494
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,420
How do I put this on?

495
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,420
You can just put water on it.

496
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,420
It's cute.

497
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,420
I thought it would look good in yellow.

498
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,420
What? Here?

499
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,420
Please tie it there.

500
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,420
This is a micro bikini.

501
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,420
Have you ever worn something like this?

502
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,420
No, I haven't.

503
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,420
Really?

504
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,420
I don't know how to wear it.

505
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,420
But you wear bikinis and go to the beach, right?

506
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,420
No, no.

507
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,420
But I don't wear such a small bikini.

508
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,420
Really?

509
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,420
It's cool, isn't it?

510
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,420
Is it done?

511
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,420
It's good if it dries out.

512
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,420
Is it good?

513
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,420
It's the same.

514
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,420
Well then,

515
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,420
I'm going to close this.

516
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,420
How does it feel?

517
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,420
What are you going to do?

518
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,420
Do you want to go outside?

519
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,420
No

520
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,420
No?

521
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,420
It's embarrassing

522
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,420
That's right. You'll get caught.

523
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,420
The clothes you were wearing earlier.

524
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,420
Here.

525
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,420
Yes.

526
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,420
Try it on.

527
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,420
It's more comfortable than the first one.

528
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:17,420
But I think it's gotten a lot better than the first one.

529
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,420
Say it in words.

530
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,420
Yes.

531
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,420
If you want to kiss, kiss.

532
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,420
If you feel good, feel good.

533
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,420
There is still a long way to go.

534
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,420
From now on, this is the key.

535
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,420
Hold this.

536
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,420
There are other men on the top.

537
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,420
This.

538
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,420
Can you hold this?

539
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,420
I understand.

540
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,420
Do something nice with that person next time.

541
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,420
Yes.

542
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,420
Hold this camera.

543
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,420
I'm sorry.

544
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,420
Hello.

545
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,420
Excuse me.

546
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,420
This is a thread.

547
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,420
This is a thread.

548
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,420
A thread?

549
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,420
Yes, please.

550
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,420
Please.

551
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,420
This way, please.

552
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,420
You're a college student, aren't you?

553
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,420
Yes.

554
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,420
How is school?

555
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,420
It's fun.

556
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,420
Really?

557
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,420
Why did you apply for AV?

558
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,420
I'm interested in it.

559
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:59,420
And I didn't have much confidence in myself.

560
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,420
Why? You're cute.

561
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,420
I didn't think I'd be confident.

562
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,420
You're popular, aren't you?

563
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,420
No, not at all.

564
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,420
Really?

565
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,420
I see.

566
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:20,420
I heard that you want to fall in love with sex.

567
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,420
Yes.

568
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:31,420
I didn't know much about it.

569
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,420
So I want to fall in love with it.

570
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,420
That means you want to be in love with it.

571
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,420
That's right.

572
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,420
Please put your bag here.

573
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,420
I see.

574
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,420
That's right.

575
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,420
Could you please put this away for a moment?

576
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,420
Please take off your shoes.

577
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,420
I want to smell it, but I can't hear it.

578
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,420
You're motivated.

579
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,420
I'm motivated.

580
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,420
I'm motivated.

581
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,420
I'm motivated.

582
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,420
I'm motivated.

583
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,420
What are you doing?

584
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,420
I'm just doing what I feel like doing.

585
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,420
What? You look upset.

586
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,420
You just bit your lips.

587
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,420
What are you trying to do?

588
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,420
It's embarrassing.

589
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,420
Embarrassing?

590
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,420
It's better to be embarrassed.

591
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,420
It's fun to do something embarrassing.

592
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,420
Shall we do it?

593
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:22,420
I'm going to do something embarrassing for you, so that you won't have any mistakes in your life.

594
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,420
Get on the chair.

595
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:31,420
I'm going to take a nap.

596
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:08,420
It was hot today, wasn't it?

597
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,420
Yes, it was.

598
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,420
It smells good.

599
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,420
What's that?

600
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,420
What's that?

601
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,420
You like that kind of person?

602
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,420
I'm sorry.

603
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,420
I'm sorry.

604
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,420
Don't put your hands in a circle.

605
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,420
Sex is not about wanting to be in love.

606
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,420
You don't like it anymore, do you?

607
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,420
It's like you're a dog.

608
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,420
Thank you for your viewing.
