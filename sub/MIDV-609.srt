1
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:15,930
Hi, I'm Ruo.

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,990
Hi, I'm Miyo Ichikawa.

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,210
Today, I was told to come here.

4
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,370
Here, I can see it.

5
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:52,150
I was told to go under the Tokyo
Tower, so I came here with my luggage.

6
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:55,490
That's why I came here.

7
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,010
I don't have anything else.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,150
I'm just holding the camera like this.

9
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,710
I'm just holding the camera.

10
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,670
The weather is so nice.

11
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,270
It's hot.

12
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:26,410
It's a little hot, so there's a
bench over there, so I'll go.

13
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,010
I've moved to the bench.

14
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,270
It's very cool in the shade here.

15
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:46,050
The temperature has changed
just by getting in the shade.

16
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,950
There is a pond.

17
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,210
It is usually too hot outside.

18
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,830
I thought summer is hot.

19
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,790
How long should I wait?

20
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
There is a cicada.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,860
What should I do?

22
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,270
There is a cicada.

23
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,490
What are you doing?

24
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,050
What?

25
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,950
What are you doing?

26
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,390
Are you Miyo Ishikawa?

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,190
What?

28
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750
What are you shooting?

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,370
I was told to meet here today.

30
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,650
I was handed the camera.

31
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,030
I'm talking alone.

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,170
It's suspicious.

33
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:34,850
What?

34
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:35,710
It's suspicious, isn't it?

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,410
What are you doing?

36
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:43,350
I was told that there
might be a cute girl here.

37
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,290
Yes.

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,290
It's a lie to say that.

39
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,530
Yes.

40
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,290
Have you heard anything from the manager?

41
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,310
What? I haven't heard anything.

42
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,370
You've been opening your
schedule all day, haven't you?

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,650
Yes, until tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,770
Until tomorrow morning.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,230
Have you heard anything?

46
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:06,190
Actually, it's part of the plan.

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,130
What?

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,130
I just came up with something.

49
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,770
So, you have a day off.

50
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,190
Yes.

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,410
So, what are you going to do?

52
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,350
Kanamiyo and AV actress are here.

53
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,530
So, I just came up with something.

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,790
Oh, I see.

55
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,050
I see.

56
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,710
I see.

57
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,266
Anyway, it's been a while since we met.

58
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,290
Yes, it's been a while.

59
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,590
How was it?

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,890
I don't think there was
anything like that recently.

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,950
I don't think so.

62
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,370
It looks like you brought a lot of luggage.

63
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,670
Yes, I thought I'd change my clothes.

64
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,470
I was told a lot of
things, so I brought it.

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,050
It's pretty free and unplanned.

66
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,850
We went to a lot of places together.

67
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,550
I mean, do something erotic.

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,050
Is it unplanned?

69
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,130
That's what I heard.

70
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,510
Oh, I see.

71
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,890
I didn't know that.

72
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,890
You are good at self-portrait.

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,050
Is it OK? I don't know if I look good.

74
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,210
Let's go.

75
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:08,550
OK.

76
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,230
Do you have this? Thank you.

77
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,190


78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,250
Please park your car here.

79
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,290
Here?

80
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,510
Can't you speak
in the city? I can't.

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,410


82
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,530
Really?

83
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,990
I can't speak at all.

84
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:27,991
Really?

85
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
What do you mean?

86
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,030
Let's get in the car.

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,830
Let's go for a little drive.

88
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,730
What should we do?

89
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,890
I'm not hungry yet.

90
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,350
It's been a long time.

91
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,230
Really?

92
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,470
How many years has it been?

93
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,590
How many years has it been?

94
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,010
It's been 2 years since October.

95
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,750
But it's been 2 years?

96
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,630
1 year? 2 years?

97
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,050
It hasn't been 2 years yet,

98
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,530
but it's been 2 years
since this video came out.

99
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,370
How is it?

100
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,270
I've known you since your debut,
so I feel like I've seen you before.

101
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,030
You look more like an actress.

102
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,351
I feel like I've become like you.

103
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,350
Really?

104
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,490
But I'm often told that I don't grow up.

105
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,770
If I say it badly, I don't grow up.

106
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,026
If I say it well, I don't change.

107
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,510
You don't change.

108
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,710
No, I don't change.

109
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,310
I wonder if I don't have to
be dyed in a strange way.

110
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,780
I may not be dyed.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,860
I feel like I'm doing it from
scratch, forgetting every time.

112
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:51,740
So, when you were told last night or the
day after tomorrow, you were like, what?

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
What?

114
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,720
What are you going to do?

115
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,760
I didn't know, so I watched anime.

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,300
Did you watch anime? Do
you like anime? I like anime.

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,580


118
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
Only anime? Only anime.

119
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120


120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Why?

121
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Why?

122
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm still in bed.

123
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,300
You're still in bed?

124
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,120
Yes.

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,600
Wait a minute.

126
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Are you in love? No, I'm not.

127
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
Why?

128
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,800
You're not interested?

129
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,180
That's not what I mean.

130
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,680
Well, I think it's going to be hard.

131
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,400
It's hard.

132
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,401
I think it's okay now.

133
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,980
You have a job.

134
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,780
Have you ever tried something like that?

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,260
I don't think I've ever started this job.

136
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,261
I don't think so.

137
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,020
Really?

138
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,140
Do you want to go on a date?

139
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,250
No, I want to go somewhere with my friends.

140
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,590
With your female friends?

141
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,950
Yes, with my female friends.

142
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,470
I don't really want to go somewhere.

143
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,250
I don't want to go to India.

144
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,790
I want to go to a hot spring.

145
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,690
I see.

146
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,190
You are always relaxed, aren't you?

147
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,470
Don't you get angry?

148
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,010
I've only been angry once in my life.

149
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,330
That was probably the last time I was
angry when I was in elementary school.

150
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,690
I don't know if I'm angry or not.

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Here we are.

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,920
The weather is so nice.

153
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Where are we? Rainbow Bridge.

154
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh, this is Rainbow Bridge.

155
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,680
You look like Miyo-chan all day.

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
You're already erotic.

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,160
Will it change in a day?

158
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,400
Don't you masturbate?

159
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:52,700
I masturbate, but it is said
that it is a man's masturbation.

160
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,344
I understand the feeling
of a man who wants to

161
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,820
masturbate because it
is good to be with me.

162
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,653
I don't know if you can
understand what I'm saying, but I

163
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:12,460
think it's a pain in the ass
to go through that process.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,120
But apart from that, it's
a pain in the ass to do it.

165
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
It's a secret.

166
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,560
I think it's a secret, too.

167
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,800
It's a secret.

168
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,400
Let's go to a lot of places.

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Shall we go? Let's go.

170
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,600
Let's go.

171
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,780
You like sweets, don't you?

172
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,560
No.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
I like gummies and ice cream.

174
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
I'm addicted to gummies.

175
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
It's going to be blurred.

176
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,520
Isn't this hard?

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
I like hard things.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,181
Well, that's...
You're going to cry.

179
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,320
You're going to cry a lot.

180
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,800
It's not a natural fact
that everyone thinks.

181
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,020
It's an interesting project
this time, isn't it? Yeah.

182
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800


183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,680
So I thought it would be
more fun to shoot an AV.

184
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,400
What do you think, Mayu?

185
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:34,990
I didn't change for two
years, but I could change.

186
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,770
I want to have a sex that makes me excited.

187
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,010
I don't know that.

188
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,330
It's a worry.

189
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,230
It's a clothes.

190
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I see.

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,300
Ah, Dippin Dots.

192
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Dippin Dots? Dots.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000


194
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,960
Can't we choose the taste?

195
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,180
I want to eat it if I can choose.

196
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't want to eat it if
there is only this flavor.

197
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I want to eat this.

198
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
Takoyaki? Takoyaki.

199
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,040
Just a little.

200
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,120
Just a little? It's beautiful.

201
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,420


202
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,080
Eat this and then ice cream.

203
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Eat it and then?

204
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:29,735
I don't know which one will come out.

205
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,820
I don't know, but all of them are cute.

206
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Which one do you aim for?

207
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,120
The one with the mouth is cute.

208
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,440
What should I do?
There's a completely different one.

209
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,931
Now... I can't do it.

210
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,750
I can't do it.

211
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,750
You can't do it, can
you? I can't do it.

212
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,930


213
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,156
You don't need this, do you?

214
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,600
I don't need it.

215
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,420
You don't need this?

216
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I don't need it.

217
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Trash.

218
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,260
What is it? Melon
soda? Melon soda.

219
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
Green.

220
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,420
It's good.

221
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520


222
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Zakashi is good.

223
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I like it.

224
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,080
This looks like an adult's toy.

225
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
This is delicious.

226
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Do you know? I like this.

227
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,100


228
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
What is it?

229
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,500
This is sweet and spicy curry.

230
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
I eat it with chopsticks.

231
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,130
If I don't eat it with chopsticks,
my hands will get dirty.

232
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,770
I'm dyeing my hair black.

233
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,390
You're done dyeing your hair black?

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

235
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,020
When I was a kid, I
thought it was expensive.

236
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,980
But now that I'm an adult,
I don't know what it is.

237
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
It's expensive.

238
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,760
500 yen is a lot.

239
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
That's true.

240
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
It's up to 300 yen.

241
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,480
Right? It's cute.

242
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080


243
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
It's very lively.

244
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:07,340
I really like this kind of thing.

245
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:08,760
Yes, takoyaki.

246
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Let's eat.

247
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,790
This is... Oh, this is not
the one you stab a lot.

248
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
12 pieces are amazing.

249
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Is it hot? It looks hot.

250
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200


251
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,440
This is one bite takoyaki.

252
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,520
But... It's fluffy like this.

253
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,350
That's because I'm used to takoyaki.

254
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Delight.

255
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,810
How is it?

256
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,190
It's hot!

257
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,890
You have to eat it with a puff.

258
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,630
Don't close your mouth
and eat it with a puff.

259
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,030
Isn't it good? It's good.

260
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,590


261
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,250
Doesn't it taste like dashi?

262
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,530
What?

263
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,180
You sound like a reaction comedian.

264
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,310
Is it good?

265
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,930
Is it better than you
thought? It's good.

266
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,250
It's small, so it's full.

267
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:14,890
It's hot.
It's been a while since I had takoyaki.

268
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,330
It's like the one you dip in the soup.

269
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:19,750
Akashiyaki? Oh, yeah.

270
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,550
It tastes like that.

271
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,710
The one before you dip it in the soup.

272
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,570
You've been doing a lot of
social media, haven't you?

273
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,740
I used to do it, but I don't post selfies.

274
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,890
I've been on Twitter all the time.

275
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,710
What about Instagram?

276
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,470
I'm on Instagram.

277
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm doing TikTok and YouTube.

278
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,790
I've seen a little bit of YouTube.

279
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,930
Why?

280
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,310
I saw it, and it came out.

281
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,690
I thought, oh, you're doing it.

282
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,050
It's coming out.

283
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,110
One more.

284
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,210
One more.

285
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,230
I bought this.

286
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,070
Which one is the one
with the grain? This one.

287
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,330
I'll buy it.

288
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,250
I'll buy it.

289
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,190
You're fast.

290
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,150
I thought you weren't here.

291
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,610
What?

292
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,691
I thought you weren't here.

293
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,870
Okay.

294
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,910
What is this?

295
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,950
What was it?

296
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,810
Strawberry cheesecake.

297
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,270
That's a lot.

298
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,690
Here you go.

299
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,010
Thank you for the food.

300
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,090
Yay! It looks good.

301
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,190


302
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,010
I'm getting excited when it's ice cream.

303
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,250
I love ice cream.

304
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,130
Ice cream.

305
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,430
Do you eat ice cream at home?

306
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,100
My house is covered in ice cream.

307
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,530
Wow.

308
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,950
My freezer is full of ice cream.

309
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,836
What flavor is it?
The base is yogurt, right?

310
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,640
This is yogurt and strawberry sauce.

311
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,620
You put strawberry sauce on yogurt?

312
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,420
And this cheesecake.

313
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,760
Are you more excited than
when you ate takoyaki? Of course.

314
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860


315
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,080
What?

316
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,660
Ice cream is my favorite food.

317
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Ice cream?

318
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,980
How about this kind of project?

319
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm happy to eat ice cream.

320
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,680
It's not a cheesecake, is it?

321
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,720
It's not a cheesecake, is it?

322
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,060
It's not a cheesecake, is it?

323
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:41,880
I don't need it.

324
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,960
Oh, no, it's gone.

325
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,490
Thank you for the meal.

326
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Snacks, too.

327
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,110
Oh, snacks.

328
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,770
Don't forget this.

329
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,450
Thank you.

330
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,830
I got it.

331
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,110
I got it.

332
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,111
I love you.

333
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,450
It's big.

334
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,750
Is it big? It's heavy.

335
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,770


336
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,570
What's in it? It's a tent.

337
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,630


338
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Let's make a toast.

339
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,230
The weather is so nice.

340
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,030
Can I put it here?

341
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,750
Did you drink it?

342
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
My glass was like this.

343
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,090
Really?

344
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I don't think so.

345
00:16:47,470 --> 00:17:01,010
It's not Kirin lemon.

346
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,510
It's Mitsuya cider.

347
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,630
I like Mitsuya cider, Sprite, Kirin
lemon, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.

348
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,410
It's been a while since
I've seen a camera like this.

349
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,890
But on the contrary, it's
better not to say anything.

350
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I'm not nervous.

351
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,290
I'm not going to sleep with this on.

352
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm going to sleep with this on.

353
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,070
I'm going to sleep with this on.

354
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:33,071
Can you hold this for me?

355
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I don't think I can.

356
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,370
It's heavy.

357
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,930
It's definitely heavy.

358
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,040
You changed your eyes for a moment.

359
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Do my eyes change?

360
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Yes.

361
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,080
My eyes are my eyes.

362
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,620
Your eyes are erotic eyes.

363
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Am I wrong? I don't know.

364
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700


365
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,620
Is it me?

366
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:36,400
I thought you were
putting on a lot of cider.

367
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
What?

368
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,770
I'm about to throw up.

369
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,920
Let it out.

370
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Let it out.

371
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,560
I don't know.

372
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,380
I don't know.

373
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,080
I'm going to put a book on it.

374
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,780
Oh, it's a book.

375
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,500
Are you interested in this book?

376
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,060
I'm not interested in this book.

377
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm interested in this
book when I look at it.

378
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm going to look at it.

379
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,340
You look like a person
who doesn't have a neck.

380
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,550
I'm going to stick out my neck.

381
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,240
I did it.

382
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,530
It's here, isn't it? Here? Here.

383
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,290


384
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,070


385
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,390
Because of the pants?

386
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,570
I can wear it like this.

387
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,190
When did you last do it?

388
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:41,111
When was the last time
you had sex with a woman?

389
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,430
When was it?

390
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,435
The day before yesterday.

391
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,970
Oh.

392
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,130
What was it?

393
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
It wasn't BL, was
it? No, it wasn't.

394
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,890


395
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,216
But sometimes you want to
have sex, don't you? In your mood.

396
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240


397
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,580
Does that mean you feel dizzy?

398
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:03,516
I don't mind if I have sex with a woman.

399
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:03,800
What do you mean?

400
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Do you feel like you want to have sex?

401
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,280
Do you want to have sex?

402
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,520
Do you go to bed
as it is? Yes, I do.

403
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,870
You sleep well.

404
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,420


405
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,280
I thought I had a good sleeping habit.

406
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,730
What are you doing?

407
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,380
No one is here today.

408
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,300
It's better than usual.

409
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
It's better than usual.

410
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,320
You can be bold.

411
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:45,361
You don't have to do that.

412
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,760
I don't know if I can do it.

413
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,920
Do you do like this?

414
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,856
Are you embarrassed
to be seen? No, I'm not.

415
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
When you are peeing.

416
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,680
Recently, when I'm peeing,

417
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
I rub the floor.

418
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,860
Do you rub your hands?

419
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Next to my face.

420
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,380
Oh, you rub your hands completely.

421
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:11,381
It means rubbing.

422
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,260
Oh, it's like that.

423
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
It's like that.

424
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,040
And then it comes out.

425
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,990
Like rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.

426
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,560
Rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.

427
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
It's a cushion.

428
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
Ah.

429
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,280
What are you doing?

430
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,260
What are you doing?

431
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,900
No, no, no, no, no.

432
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,320
No, no, no, no, no.

433
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,500
No, no, no, no, no.

434
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:35,780
You're excited.

435
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:36,781
I don't want to.

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't want to.

437
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,740
I don't want to.

438
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,720
I don't want to.

439
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:53,320
I don't want to.

440
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:53,960
I don't want to.

441
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:54,240
I don't want to.

442
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I don't want to.

443
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,400
I don't want to.

444
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
I don't want to.

445
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,080
I don't want to.

446
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:05,400
I don't want to.

447
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,401
I don't want to.

448
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:27,060
It's hot, isn't
it? No, it's not.

449
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260


450
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm going to take off
my pants, so look at me.

451
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,491
For example, when you
go on a date and have sex,

452
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:13,300
which one do you prefer,
standing or standing?

453
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,180
I'd rather stand.

454
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Right?

455
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,380
I don't want to stand outside.

456
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:26,260
It's a little dangerous to stand outside,
but don't you have such an image of Cammy?

457
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
What?

458
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,660
No?

459
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,860
It's my selfishness.

460
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,980
Are you ready?

461
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
Let's get started.

462
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:44,920
You are getting excited, aren't you?

463
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,980
Your face changes once you start.

464
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:47,981
Right?

465
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
You are amazing.

466
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,485
Don't get excited.

467
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,670
Do you want to see?

468
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,830
No, I don't want to.

469
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,470
Look at the face of the person who went.

470
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,870
Open your legs.

471
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,370
Show me your belly button.

472
00:27:15,371 --> 00:27:16,670
Like this.

473
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,590
Come on.

474
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,870
Great.

475
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,350
You are so small.

476
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,170
It's small.

477
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:31,970
Is it small? It's small.

478
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,570


479
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,290
What? It's heavy.

480
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:33,910


481
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,910
Is it heavy or
small? It's a shield.

482
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,510


483
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,030
Really?

484
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,150
Do you want to see it?

485
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,470
It's my first time to see it.

486
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,490
It's my first time to see your face.

487
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,230
Why?

488
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,970
Didn't you see it in the mirror when you
were in junior high school or high school?

489
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,090
I think I saw it at the
end of junior high school.

490
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,550
Here you are.

491
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,551
What? Wait a minute.

492
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,750
Wait a minute.

493
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,370
Wait a minute.

494
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,061
She may be the most shy.

495
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,660
Touch her.

496
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,040
She is wet.

497
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
What?

498
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,200
She is a bad girl.

499
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
She is a bad girl.

500
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Wait a minute.

501
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,530
There is a floor over there.

502
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,530
Floor?

503
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,870
There is a floor and cushion.

504
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,130
No.

505
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:52,970
There is.

506
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:53,410
No.

507
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,110
There is.

508
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:54,910
Just a little.

509
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:55,410
Ah.

510
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,870
Just a little.

511
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,190
Ah.

512
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,920
You are so beautiful.

513
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,430
Which side is
better? I don't know.

514
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,590


515
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:17,980
Really?

516
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Here?

517
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,270
Don't you like it?

518
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,210
No.

519
00:29:50,570 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm doing my best to make him feel better.

520
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:20,190
He's so cute that I can't stop hugging him.

521
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,970
He's getting better and better.

522
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:25,710
He is like a commentator.

523
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,750
It's a hole.

524
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,310
It's a hole.

525
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,370
It's not like that.

526
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,790
It's wrinkled.

527
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,930
Look at the other side.

528
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,250
I can't see it.

529
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,490
My favorite gummy bear.

530
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,590
It doesn't matter.

531
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,970
I can't get it.

532
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:26,971
Don't eat it.

533
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
I'll take it off.

534
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,070
It's too hot.

535
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,610
Too hot?

536
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,730
Is it harder? It's soft.

537
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,370
I'll try it.

538
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,290


539
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,360
I'm going to eat it all.

540
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,361
I'm going to eat it all.

541
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:17,750
It's crumbling.

542
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,790
Oh!

543
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,710
Are you hitting me?

544
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,210
Yes.

545
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
You are so warm.

546
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,450
Look at me.

547
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,990
I did it.

548
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,150
Can I? Let's sit down.

549
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320


550
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Yes.

551
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Let's go.

552
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Since you are so bright,

553
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Bright?

554
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,600
Isn't it erotic to have sex?

555
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,480
When the camera
comes like this, I look at it.

556
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
That's right.

557
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,360
It's a job disease.

558
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,820
Look.

559
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Let's look at the navel.

560
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,280
Navel.

561
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
Navel.

562
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,010
Touch my chest.

563
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:04,280
I'm going to pick it up.

564
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,030
You don't have to look at me.

565
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,120
You don't have to look at me.

566
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,420
Aren't you erotic?

567
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,080
Were you sleeping?

568
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,500
I don't like big ones.

569
00:34:56,501 --> 00:34:57,501
It's deep, isn't it?

570
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Is it deep? Yes, it's deep.

571
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,880


572
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,380
Is it deep?

573
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
Yes.

574
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Do it more.

575
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:20,580
What? Do it more.

576
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Look.

577
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140


578
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:32,820
Is this not good?

579
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,380
No.

580
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,460
Isn't it difficult?

581
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
No.

582
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,450
I'm going to give you a little more.

583
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,370
I'm going to give you a little more.

584
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:24,590
I'm going to give you a little more.

585
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Today, I'm going to show
you a video of my cat,

586
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:40,980
Kikki, who's been playing
with me for a long time.

587
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,620
Kikki, come here.

588
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,060
Kikki, what are you doing?

589
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,440
Kikki, what are you doing?

590
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,000
Kikki, what are you doing?

591
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:11,640
Kikki, what are
you doing? Cushion.

592
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,140


593
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Cushion?

594
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
What do you mean? Like this.

595
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,940
Like this.

596
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,100
Like this.

597
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:25,380
Oh, I see.

598
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:26,381
Like this.

599
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,260


600
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,140
Does it fit?

601
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:39,221
――Do you know how
to do it? ――No, I don't.

602
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,800


603
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:47,500
――It's my first time.

604
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,600
――You don't have to wear underpants.

605
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,880
――I should.

606
00:37:53,550 --> 00:38:00,340
――It's difficult.

607
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,860
It's good, isn't it? Rub, rub.

608
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,880


609
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,460
Is it good?

610
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Yes.

611
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Do you want to try?

612
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Yes.

613
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,910
Can you do it with that?

614
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,380
Yes.

615
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,980
How about now?

616
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
I can't do it now.

617
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,420
Rub, rub.

618
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,851
I'm telling you that I
want to put a new one.

619
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,460
This is difficult.

620
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,480
It's difficult.

621
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
My face is getting red.

622
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,600
This floor is difficult.

623
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
My face is getting red.

624
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,670
My face is getting red.

625
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,400
This floor is difficult.

626
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,300
Is it difficult? It's difficult.

627
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700


628
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:16,420
I'm sorry I couldn't
get a good shot of him.

629
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
He's so wet.

630
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,810
You're so slippery.

631
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:29,811
Don't do that.

632
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,750
It's beautiful, so don't worry.

633
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
Oh, it feels good.

634
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:29,630
Let's start from here.

635
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,350
Put your legs together.

636
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,730
Are you embarrassed?

637
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,610
Do you want to go in?

638
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:26,290
I'm going to make a video of
the process of making a video.

639
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,140
I'm going to make a video of
the process of making a video.

640
00:44:08,080 --> 00:45:40,720
Today, I'm going to show you how
to get rid of pimples on your face.

641
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:43,540
I'm sorry, baby.

642
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,450
I'm sorry, baby.

643
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,370
I've been talking a lot.

644
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,000
I've been talking a lot.

645
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,380
I've been talking a lot.

646
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,381
I'm going to sleep.

647
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:08,750
I'm sorry.

648
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,110
I'm sorry.

649
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,180
I'm sorry.

650
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,540
I'm sorry.

651
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:56,620
When I showed them the video
of the baby, they were surprised.

652
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:06,740
I even played with her.

653
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,396
It's been a long time since
I've had a baby, but I'm so

654
00:49:50,408 --> 00:49:52,890
happy that I can't help but
cry when I think of my baby.

655
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:57,310
I'm so happy that I can't help
but cry when I think of my baby.

656
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,441
She suddenly started to have sex.

657
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,340
Look at her.

658
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
It's out.

659
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,140
Is it out?

660
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Yes.

661
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,941
How was it? Were you excited?

662
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,760
I don't know what it is, but I was excited.

663
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,701
I was wondering what it was.

664
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,490
It started with a strange feeling.

665
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
That's right.

666
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,520
I want to dig deeper.

667
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,920
From here.

668
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,100
From here.

669
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:55,101
Let's do it.

670
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,810
Can I do it more gently?

671
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,190
Are you excited now?

672
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,770
Then, be more excited.

673
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,540
What are you doing?

674
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,480
Did you want to take a bath?

675
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,420
Because you are sweating?

676
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,860
You are mischievous.

677
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,480
It's dangerous.

678
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,580
Let me help you.

679
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,660
Thank you.

680
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,210
I ate a lot, so I'm full.

681
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:18,770
Are you full?

682
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,530
What?

683
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:21,310
No.

684
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:22,710
I see.

685
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:23,850
I ate too much ice cream.

686
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,081
You stopped eating ice cream.

687
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:29,910
What?

688
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,230
What? Your hair.

689
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,430


690
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,580
What?

691
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,460
More?

692
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:23,550
No.

693
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,590
I don't want to.

694
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,186
I don't get excited when I do
something erotic in such a place.

695
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,416
It's fun to look in the
mirror, isn't it? Yes, yes, yes.

696
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440


697
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,211
You've been going up and down all the time.

698
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,270
What are you looking at
in the mirror? I'm laughing.

699
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,690


700
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:10,910
Are you laughing?

701
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,361
You wanted to take a shower, didn't you?

702
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,560
I wanted to take a shower.

703
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,380
Do you want to take a shower?

704
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,020
Are you excited? I got a pimple.

705
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,960


706
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,330
Let's stick it out to the front.

707
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:25,970
Yuriko.

708
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,950
Let's do it here.

709
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,410
Here?

710
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,090
You want me to do it here?

711
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,390
Yes.

712
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,270
Here? Here? Later.

713
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,450


714
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,950


715
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,590
Later?

716
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,670
Yes.

717
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:22,700
Give me your paw.

718
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,610
Give me your paw.

719
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:42,290
You don't like this place, do you?

720
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:50,630
Is it close?

721
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,440
You were a little wet,
weren't you? No, I wasn't.

722
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,740


723
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,440
You weren't? I don't know.

724
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:19,500
You don't know?

725
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:42,810
What?

726
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,330
Do you want to take a shower here?

727
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,730
Here? Yes, here.

728
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,090


729
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,350
Just a little bit.

730
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,810
Just a little bit?

731
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,970
I'll take a shower here.

732
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,210
Okay.

733
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,590
Put your butt here.

734
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,906
When you're doing it, you're looking in
the mirror and getting excited, aren't you?

735
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:13,930
What? I'm sorry.

736
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,730


737
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,810
Let's do it more.

738
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,190
It's really good.

739
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:28,930
Really?

740
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:48,050
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

741
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,410
It's hard.

742
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
It's hard.

743
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
It's hard.

744
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,950

You are holding a baby.

750
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,710
Let's wash your face.

There is soap, isn't
there? Yes, there is.

755
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:27,890


756
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,370
I am a little bit nervous
because I am in my mom's home.

757
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,630
I am worried about my mom's health.

I am worried about the
condition of my mom's body.

759

I am worried about my mom's health.

760
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:10,740
She is the mother of three children, Akira.

01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:22,380
Akira &Yui She is the mother
of three children, Chizuru & Aoki.

Are you surprised?

836
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:54,960


837
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,480

walk in the night breeze?

838
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,540
In the night breeze?

It's been a while since
you've been pulled around.

847
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:28,550
Pulled around?

848
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,271
Maybe I've been pulled around.

849
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,486
But you ate a lot of ice cream, didn't you?

850
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:33,730
It was fun to eat ice cream.

851
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:36,030
I had a lot of fun today.

852
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:37,850
It's fun.

853
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,850
Sex, eat ice cream, sex, eat ice cream.

854
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:45,750
What's next after eating ice cream?

855
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,890
Sex.

856
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:51,330
Let's go.

857
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,551
You're completely off-mode today.

858
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:57,850
Off-mode? Not off-mode.

859
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:58,950


860
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:00,310
Well, eating ice cream.

861
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,190
I'm going to sleep.

862
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:08,930
If you ask your manager to open the schedule
for a day, you will sleep suspiciously.

863
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,670
I may be suspicious for a while.

864
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:16,690
Are you sleepy because you had sex?

865
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,910
I was exercising.

866
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,370
You can sleep now.

867
01:27:49,995 --> 01:27:54,900
I think this is the best
way to wake you up.

868
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,000
I was surprised.

869
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
Were you surprised?

870
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,610
Yes.

871
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:34,570
Don't you feel sleepy?

872
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,320
No, I don't feel sleepy.

873
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:27,460
Are you excited?

874
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,740
Yes.

875
01:30:29,741 --> 01:30:32,740
Do it.

876
01:30:50,915 --> 01:32:03,260
Are you ready? I don't know.

877
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,920


878
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:45,520
Look, it's harder than before.

879
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:52,680
Let me stroke your back.

880
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:57,910
Let me stroke your back.

881
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:00,710
Let me stroke your back.

882
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,570
Let me know if you want to stroke my back.

883
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,150
Can you see it?

884
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:27,390
Can you see it?

885
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:28,790
Can you see it?

886
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:34,310
What? Come here.

887
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:35,870


888
01:36:41,020 --> 01:37:01,310
Does it hurt?

889
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:10,090
No.

890
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:17,760
I think it's better to do this.

891
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:33,740
You've been having sex all the
time, so it's easier for you to get up.

892
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,940
I don't know.

893
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,160
Ouch!

894
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:52,860
You are shaking a lot.

895
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:58,900
Put your hand on my back and show me.

896
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,400
I'm going to take a bath.

897
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:14,920
What?

898
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,700
Do you want to take a bath?

899
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,680
I'm going to massage your buttocks.

900
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,800
You look like a rich man.

901
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:55,820
I'm sorry.

902
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,630
What's wrong?

903
01:41:48,910 --> 01:42:02,950
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

904
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:12,290
I'm going to put the cat in the box.

905
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:36,060
I'm going to put the cat in the box.

906
01:42:36,061 --> 01:42:36,700
I'm going to put the cat in the box.

907
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:40,420
You are so mean.

908
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:34,660
Give me more.

909
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:39,500
Harder.

910
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,500
That's great.

911
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:48,160
It feels good.

912
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:16,840
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying.

913
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:39,280
I'm worried that she's going to be sick.

914
01:44:39,281 --> 01:44:40,281
I'm worried about her.

915
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:45,820
I'm worried that she's going to be sick.

916
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:12,630
I'm worried about her.

917
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:31,450
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's so cute.

918
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,950
I'm so happy to see a cat like this.

919
01:46:05,951 --> 01:46:06,690
I'm so happy to see a cat like this.

920
01:46:06,691 --> 01:46:08,131
I'm so happy to see a cat like this.

921
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:20,710
I'm so happy to see a cat like this.

922
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,070
You don't usually
exercise, do you? No, I don't.

923
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:23,090


924
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:31,030
Oh, you fell down.

925
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:32,590
You can lie down.

926
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:34,050
Lie down?

927
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:35,270
Do whatever you like.

928
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:37,090
Whatever I like?

929
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:38,270
Whatever you like.

930
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,160
He woke up.

931
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,680
He woke up.

932
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:49,720
This? I knew it.

933
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,640


934
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:09,400
She's been living in the
car for about an hour now.

935
01:47:32,230 --> 01:47:34,080
But she doesn't know that
I'm going to cut her nails.

936
01:47:34,081 --> 01:47:35,881
So I decided to cut her
nails when I saw her.

937
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:44,960
Fubuki, the oldest, has a lot of hair.

938
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:52,431
Fubuki, the oldest, has a lot of hair.

939
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:54,880
He is a little bit old.

940
01:48:54,881 --> 01:48:55,881
He is a little bit old.

941
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,060
He is a little bit old.

942
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:07,900
Fubuki is a young cat.

943
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:08,940
I'm sorry.

944
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:06,680
Are you OK?

945
01:50:06,681 --> 01:50:07,681
Are you awake?

946
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,440
Are you awake?

947
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:10,960
Are you awake?

948
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:11,420
I'm going to sleep.

949
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:40,790
She fell asleep.

950
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:41,791
I'm going to sleep.

951
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:04,340
What are you doing?

952
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:23,560
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

953
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:56,330
Bring the baby to me.

954
01:54:19,065 --> 01:54:32,180
Do you want to lie down on the bed?

955
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,030
I'm going to massage your back.

956
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:42,271
I'm going to massage your back.

957
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:58,620
I'm going to massage your back.

958
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:31,780
Close your eyes.

959
01:56:13,370 --> 01:56:14,710
I haven't gone yet.

960
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:33,940
Have you gone? I don't know.

961
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:35,340


962
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:36,380
You don't know? I don't know.

963
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:37,570


964
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,480
You don't know? Help me.

965
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,760
Wait a minute.

966
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,060


967
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:05,010
He looks like he is crying.

968
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,220
He finally woke up.

969
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:19,930
He woke up.

970
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:21,710
It's morning, so we have to go home.

971
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:26,820
We have to get ready to go home.

972
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:37,920
Are you sleepy?

973
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:41,940
Are you sleepy?

974
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:44,460
Are you sleepy?
