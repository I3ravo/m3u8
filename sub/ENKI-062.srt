1
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,990
Master, I beg you.
Please make it messy again today.

2
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,380
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

3
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,440
Master, I want you to put in a lot of mud.

4
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,181
It's enough with your fingers.

5
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,070
I can't believe I'm
doing this to myself.

6
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:56,071
Ah!

7
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,010
This is the third time.

8
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,290
It feels good.

9
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,080
Let's stretch it tomorrow, huh.

10
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,460
Okay.

11
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,580
what are you doing?

12
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Let me see your face.

13
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,460
Look, something is coming out.

14
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,690
Don't let it out.

15
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:17,150
What is this?

16
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:24,050
I don't want to do it anymore
Why are you doing this?

17
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,270
It's strange, isn't it?

18
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
Your hands are dirty.

19
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,300
You just rub it

20
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,620
No, you shouldn't.

21
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,890
You are funny.

22
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,830
Stop it.

23
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,450
I told you that you are wet.

24
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,590
Hey.

25
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,570
Your hair is wet.

26
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:20,120
I can't believe I'm doing this...
I can't believe I'm doing this...

27
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,980
what's your name?

28
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
my name is Tomo.

29
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,620
my name is Muneo.

30
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,980
oh my god what's your name?

31
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,480
my name is Takashi

32
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,760
Don't be angry.

33
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:52,030
Don't be angry.

34
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm going to put it on your feet.

35
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,940
I'm going to make you beautiful.

36
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
What should I do?

37
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,570
You rubbed your own feelings, didn't you?

38
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,030
You're doing it with your feet, right?

39
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,570
It's a little hard.

40
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:25,750
Come on.

41
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,670
It feels good.

42
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,870
It's warm.

43
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,251
It's time for you to go to bed.

44
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,820
You're a good girl today.

45
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,450
Do you want some?

46
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,930
Yes, I do.

47
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,240
Excuse me.

48
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
...

49
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,770
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,770
Let me do it.

51
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,890
I told you to lick me!

52
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,890
I told you, didn't I?

53
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,510
You didn't lick me enough.

54
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,090
I'm sorry.

55
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,770
Lick me.

56
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,230
Lick my head, too.

57
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,200
I told you, didn't I?

58
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Lick from head to toe.

59
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,210
Use your whole tongue.

60
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,530
How many times do I have to do it?

61
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,416
Do you want me to put it in your mouth?

62
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,190
Yes, is it okay if I put it in your mouth?

63
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,090
Yes, it's okay.

64
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,210
Don't chew on your own.

65
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,890
Look at the camera and talk.

66
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,760
Take a deep breath and stop there.

67
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,840
There's still this much left.

68
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,640
Drink all of it.

69
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,330
Don't you know what it is?

70
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Give me more.

71
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,280
It doesn't feel good at all.

72
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Is it painful?

73
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,240
Are you tired?

74
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,241
Do you understand?

75
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,660
Do you understand, Oku?

76
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,930
I don't want to stop you.

77
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,710
Oku.

78
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,710
Look at the back, can you see?

79
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
Who told you to spit?

80
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,760
I don't know.

81
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,030
Keep going.

82
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
I didn't tell you to spit.

83
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,260
I told you to look at the back.

84
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,860
I'll help you.

85
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,060
Look at the camera.

86
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,061
Look at the camera.

87
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,940
I'm filming.

88
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Look at the camera.

89
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,060
Don't cry.

90
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,380
You're not crying, are you?

91
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,440
Suck it.

92
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:48,605
You have to wash your hands.

93
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,890
It doesn't feel good
if you don't go this far.

94
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,380
Don't put your teeth up.

95
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,381
What's wrong?

96
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:20,510
What's wrong?

97
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,280
You have a wound on your nose.

98
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,090
It's not good.

99
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,700
You have a wound on your nose.

100
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
You have a wide nose.

101
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
It's painful?

102
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
It's painful?

103
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,870
You have a lot of vomit here.

104
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,100
You have to go down.

105
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,420
You have no place to put your foot.

106
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Go down.

107
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,780
I'm going to give him a treat.

108
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,840
I'm going to give him a treat.

109
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,780
What's wrong with you?

110
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,420
Your throat is getting wider.

111
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,530
You should spit it out.

112
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,750
You can take it out.

113
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:16,780
You can take it out.

114
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
You can take it out.

115
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,280
What's wrong?

116
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,620
It's in the bowl.

117
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,660
Let's continue.

118
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,000
I can't help but feel that I'm sick.

119
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm sick.

120
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I'm sick.

121
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
It's so good.

122
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,950
Oh, my God.

123
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:17,230
Ugh... It doesn't
look like it's working.

124
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,390
I don't know.

125
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,760
It's hard to breathe.

126
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,820
I can't feel my breath.

127
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,160
I don't know who you
are, where are you from?

128
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,460
I'm a Japanese.

129
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,300
I'm a Japanese.

130
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:34,760
Ahhhhhhhhhhh Haaa haa haa
haa haa haaa haa haa What's inside?

131
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,711
haa haa ahh My cosmetic skin.

132
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,070
What is inside?

133
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,530
Foundation.

134
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,990
Inside.

135
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,970
R Moly?

136
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,010
Really inside

137
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,910
ARRRGHHHH AHHHHHHHHHH.

138
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:55,260
HAaaa haa

139
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,660
HAa Ha.

140
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

141
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:56,310
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

142
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,300
oh, oh, oh.

143
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,640
You're here to say good morning.

144
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,440
You're a low-class.

145
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,020
Oh, it feels good.

146
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:05,560
I don't want to go back
to the old man's house.

147
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,210
Put your butt in.

148
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,010
Open it and put the mannequin in.

149
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,910
I'm so happy!

150
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:47,550
I'm so happy!

151
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,092
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

152
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Ah...

153
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,760
This is raw Chimpo, right?

154
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:20,110
Was it delicious?

155
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,710
Yes, it was.

156
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,510
I'm in the camera of happiness.

157
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,070
It was delicious.

158
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,350
Raw Chimpo was in it.

159
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,090
I'm happy.

160
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:32,370
You are so cute.

161
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:33,371
You are so big.

162
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
You are wet.

163
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,470
Can I dry your belly?

164
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,810
Your belly.

165
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:57,320
You are amazing.

166
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,321
What's wrong with you?

167
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:13,580
Do you want to go out?

168
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Let's go.

169
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
How much did you get?

170
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,260
I got a lot.

171
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,580
There was a lot in the manga.

172
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
A guest has come.

173
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,280
Kano.

174
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:00,540
Yes.

175
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
A stranger has come.

176
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
What?

177
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:07,000
It's your new friend.

178
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Is that so?

179
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,440
Be nice to him.

180
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Okay.

181
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
Can I call him?

182
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Yes.

183
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
I'm sorry.

184
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,340
I'll clean up and get ready.

185
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
Okay.

186
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,610
Do I look good today?

187
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:49,130
Of course, I'm ready for it.

188
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,870
I have a good reputation, so I
can introduce myself to any guy.

189
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,890
I'm looking forward to it.

190
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,590
I'm at the level you can expect.

191
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:06,591
Really?

192
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,450
What?

193
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,410
Not yet?

194
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,850
He said he'd get ready.

195
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,810
He's taking a shower.

196
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,481
You don't have to take a shower.

197
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,090
He's honest.

198
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:26,930
It's okay.

199
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
It's long.

00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,600
It's good.

201
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,940
Do you want me to push you?

202
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,540
It's good.

203
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,541
It's good, isn't it?

204
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,240
Do you want to take a shower?

205
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,880
No, I don't want to.

206
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,670
I'm looking forward to it.

207
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,830
That's all.

208
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,230

Yes, sir.

218

I'm going to massage you.

223
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,450
Do you feel good?

224
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:56,910
It feels good.

225
00:48:56,911 --> 00:48:57,911
Does it feel good?

226
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,030
How do you feel?

227
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,750
It feels good.

What are you doing in the shower?

233
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,651
I think she is still awake

I'm going to take it off.

288
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:19,720
Take a deep breath
and hold it for a moment.

289
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,900
Oh, my God.

290
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,740
Oh, my God.

I'll be fine.

296
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,230
Oh, my God.

297
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:35,311
Why don't you take a break?

298
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,590
Oh, my God.

299

301
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,750
Oh, my God.

302
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:08,210
Oh, my God.

303
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,150

00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,580
I'm behind you!

305
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:53,370
Stop hearing these things on TV.

306
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,950
Wait, there's another bowl here.

307
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,430
Here, wash your face.

308
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,150
I am waiting for the baby to come home.

309
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,700
The baby is crying like a child.

310
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,061
I am trying to calm down the baby.

311
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,340
I am trying to calm down the baby.

312
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,616
I am trying to calm down the baby.

313
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,840
You don't eat this?

314
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,480
You don't eat this?

315
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:38,530
You said so, didn't you?

316
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,050
You said so, didn't you?

317
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,610
I did say so.

318
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,110
Don't cry.

319
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,230
What are you doing?

320
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:52,810
I'm not crying.

321
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:53,650
I'm not crying.

322
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:54,651
What's wrong?

323
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:56,950
I'm not crying.

324
01:00:56,951 --> 01:00:58,890
Good girl.

325
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,640
He jumped to the tub.

326
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,900
Good job!

327
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,310
Can you see the burp?

328
01:01:59,311 --> 01:02:00,311
Are you burping?

329
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,250
Look at this.

330
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,080
Aren't you burping?

331
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:59,230
Easy! Don't worry, it's not that bad!

332
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:14,980
So you don't have to
worry about your scalp.

333
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,280
I'm still warming it.

334
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:05,930
I don't want to drink it.

335
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,770
It's hot.

336
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:37,830
You are so good.

337
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:38,991
I'm gonna get you some water.

338
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:47,320
You've run a lot of errands, haven't you?

339
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:08,640
You are still wetting your pants.

340
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:09,681
Hey, don't wet your pants.

341
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,960
You have a lot of errands to run.

342
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,060
It's hot.

343
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:44,370
I can't do it anymore.

344
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,310
I told you not to use it.

345
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,190
I told you not to use it.

346
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,030
You can't run away from me.

347
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:23,970
Open your eyes.

348
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,670
You should look at the audience.

349
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,570
Oh, it's hot.

350
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,210
Something came out.

351
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,590
You should take a bath.

352
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,340
You want to take a bath?

353
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,600
Good boy.

354
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:54,800
But, you are not taking a bath.

355
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:55,880
You are not taking a bath.

356
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:56,881
I'm sorry.

357
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,280
Oh, wow.

358
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:19,530
Oh, you're coming out.

359
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:43,320
You don't need to pee, do you?

360
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,700
Don't you need to pee?

361
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,061
No, I don't I can't
hear you I want to pee.

362
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,940
Do you want to pee?

363
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,160
I want to pee No,
I'll give you more.

364
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,520
Do you want me to give you more?

365
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,300
Look, here.

366
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,960
Look over there.

367
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,880
Lift your chin up.

368
01:11:56,650 --> 01:12:00,240
I'm going to take the urinal out.

369
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,910
I think I can do it.

370
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,750
OK.

371
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:23,490
Don't grab it so hard.

372
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,261
Do you feel pain in your bones?

373
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,530
Hey, you.

374
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,110
What's wrong? Why are you so relaxed?

375
01:12:59,111 --> 01:13:00,111
I'm doing my best.

376
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,670
I'll give you a lot of milk.

377
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,290
I'll give you a lot of milk.

378
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,590
I want to use it more.

379
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,310
I'll give you a lot of milk.

380
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,390
Go on Walk slowly.

381
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,190

383
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,960
If you want to sleep, you have
to stretch your buttocks more.

384
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,891
You want to stretch your
buttocks, so you close your buttocks.

385
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,030
And then, look.

386
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:35,610
Behind us.

387
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,190
Not yet.

388
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:12,750
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

389
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,900
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

390
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:06,061
I can't put it in your mouth.

391
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:52,160
I've been doing it over and over
again, but I can't stand it anymore.

392
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,220
I don't know if I can
do it if I try it myself.

393
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:00,480
I don't know.

394
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,180
I'm tired.

395
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,520
Let's try to move.

396
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,580
Can you move?

397
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,760
It's good to be able to do it like this.

398
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,240
Does your tail feel good?

399
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,380
I feel good.

400
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:48,760
Does your stomach hurt?

401
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,240
It hurts.

402
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,220
I'm glad.

403
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,460

hey, hey, don't do that.

408
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:32,660
You push the back of
the head with your back.

409
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,860
Okay.

410
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,140
And push the belly.

411
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,840

413
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:45,780
I'm so tired!

414
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:02,100
Don't push.

And you use the hole.

420
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:38,440
You can stand up.

421
01:19:54,521 --> 01:20:01,330
I don't feel good.

422
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:21,950
I don't feel good.

423
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,530
It's not good because you're young.

424
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:27,550
I don't feel good.

425
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:30,290
I don't feel good.

426
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:34,951

01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:24,650

01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:10,410
I can't do it anymore.

447
01:24:10,411 --> 01:24:11,510
You fell down, didn't you?

448
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:13,150
I'm sorry.

449

Let's go home.

01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,290
Look at this.

453
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,570
I'm taking a picture of you.

454
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,390
Look at this.

455
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,950
What's in your nose?

456
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:01,950
I have a pimple in my nose.

457
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,250
That's good.

458
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,350
Yes.

01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:07,510
Yes.

462
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,210
It doesn't matter whose pimple it is.

463
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:12,590
No, it doesn't.

464
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:13,610
It doesn't matter.

465
01:25:13,611 --> 01:25:14,611
Who are you?

466
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,030

your mouth You are so cute

475
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,030
I took it out.

476
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,390
Don't waste it.

477
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,640
You can do it.

478
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,300
You can do it.

479
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,500
You can do it.

480
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:11,920
Do you feel good?

481
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,920
Yes.

482
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,950

489
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,380
This is not good.

490
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,500

01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,890

01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,580
So, please don't wet me.

515
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,500
Please help me.

516
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:27,610
He went out.

517
01:34:27,611 --> 01:34:29,331
I put a blue one in there, but it came out.

518
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,400
Thank you.

519
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:39,460
It's a relief.

520
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,910
I can't stand it anymore.

521
01:35:14,095 --> 01:35:16,830
I can't help it. I want something from you.

522
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:29,111
Why do you want something
from me all of a sudden?

523
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:33,160
I can't help it, either.

524
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,800
What do you mean?

525
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,480
It doesn't feel good at all.

526
01:36:01,481 --> 01:36:03,040
I'm sorry.

527
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,260
I'll do my best.

528
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:13,280
You've been cute all this time.

529
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,580
I'm sorry.

530
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:49,600
What's wrong?

531
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,900
I'm going to take off my panties.

532
01:36:52,901 --> 01:36:53,901
I'm going to take a nap.

533
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,090
You're awake.

534
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,750
You're going to be eaten.

535
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:13,890
You can't be like this.

536
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:41,230
You didn't want to push me, did you?

537
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:45,490
I've got two other people.

538
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:46,930
We prepared it for you.

539
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:48,630
Thank you so much.

540
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,621
You have to chew properly
You have to swallow it I'm sorry.

541
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:19,150
I'm going to pour you some water.

542
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,690
I'm so glad that we are all together.

543
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:10,350
I'm so glad that we are all together.

544
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:17,350

545
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:26,950
To the right, to the left, to

I'm sorry.

547
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,890
I'm sorry.

548
01:40:05,891 --> 01:40:06,891
Can I do anything?

549
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:08,830
Can I do anything?

550
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:10,410
Yes.

551
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:28,920
It's delicious, isn't it?

552
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,340
It's delicious.

553
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,500
It's delicious.

554
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:48,501
Don't cry.

555
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,281
I'm going to rub you
from the front to the back.

556
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,551
I'm going to rub you
from the front to the back.

557
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:23,160
Are you happy now?

558
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:28,320
Let's do something more fun.

Let's do something more fun.

560
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:44,620
You can't see him, can you?

561
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:47,480
No, I can't see him.

562
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,340
What? What's that sound?

563
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,900
He is groaning.

564
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:01,420
He is groaning.

565
01:42:02,145 --> 01:42:04,900
I want to see him
more He is groaning.

566
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,560
What's so scary about it?

567
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:07,780
It's just like that.

568
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,000
It's scary, isn't it?

569
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,000
Don't go on your own.

570
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,140
Can you bear it?

571
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,300
Can you bear it?

572
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:30,380
I can't.

573
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,340
I'm going to die.

574
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,060
You just got out.

575
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:46,500
I'm going to kill you.

576

I'm sorry.

577
01:42:55,675 --> 01:42:59,320
I'm going to die.

578
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:11,120
Oh, you got dirty with water
on your own, didn't you?

579
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,236
Do you want to go over there?

580
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,260
Let's go this way.

There's a bed in front of you.

584
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:45,390
Come to me while doing this.

585
01:43:45,391 --> 01:43:46,391
Good boy.

586
01:43:51,535 --> 01:43:53,710
You listen to me, don't you?

587
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:21,050
Can you listen to me?

588
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:23,410
Can you?

589
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:26,850
Are you okay?

590
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,250
I can't get up.

591
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:43,730

Are you scared?

595
01:45:00,421 --> 01:45:02,480
You want to sleep comfortably, don't you?

596
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,860
Let's take a look.

597
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,240
There are so many people.

598
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:13,940
Look at everyone's faces.

599
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:20,430
Look over here.

600
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,490
A lot of people have gathered.

601
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:30,230
Look at the people around you.

Can't you see?

603
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:32,990
Why?

604
01:45:32,991 --> 01:45:33,991
Why are you crying?

605
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:39,310
Are you embarrassed?

606
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:49,350
We've done a lot of fun
things today, haven't we?

607
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:55,630
I've prepared something even
more interesting for the end.

I'll take care of my Canon.

620
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:49,180
The baby's crying is so cute.

621
01:48:53,181 --> 01:48:54,560
The baby's crying is so cute.

634
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,120
It's better, isn't it?

635

I'm going to show you how to drink it.

645
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,400
Do you want to drink it?

It's a miracle, isn't it?

657
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,020
Both hands are free, aren't they?

658
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,940
It's free, isn't it?

659
01:51:46,941 --> 01:51:48,180
Put your hands together.

660
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:49,840
Don't play with it.

661
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,660
It's a problem, isn't it?

662
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:59,480
It's amazing, isn't it?

663
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,320
Come, come, come.

I'll let you go.

671
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:21,981
It's so sweet.

Beautiful.

677
01:52:45,121 --> 01:52:46,121
It's a good thing.

678
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,400
Show me your butt.

679
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:58,420
Show me your butt.

680
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,600
Show me your butt.

681
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,320
This way.

682
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,560
This way.

683
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,320
Great.

684
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,860
What's he going to do?

685
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:13,000
He's going to throw up.

686
01:53:13,001 --> 01:53:14,001
Look here.

687
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:16,880
Maybe he should throw up in order.

688
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,880
Look at his blood vessels.

689
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,400
Show your blood vessels.

690
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:25,020
What's going on?

691
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,120
He has a strong immune system.

692
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,860
Show your blood vessels.

693
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,640
Show your blood vessels.

694
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:34,760
Show your blood vessels.

695
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:35,220
He's opening his mouth.

696
01:53:35,221 --> 01:53:38,180
Open it! Open it!

697
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,280
Open it! Open it!

698
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:40,640
Open it! Open it!

699
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:44,120
What's in your belly?

700
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:48,480
My butt is in there.

701
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:49,960
Where's your butt?

702
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:51,360
It's in my belly button.

703
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:53,580
Is it twisted?

704
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,120
Yes.

705
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,160
That's good.

706
01:53:58,260 --> 01:53:59,720
Let's feed you.

707
01:53:59,721 --> 01:54:00,960
Oh, he's feeding!!

708
01:54:00,961 --> 01:54:03,100
They are feeding their babies!!

709
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:06,180
You guys are really nice!!

710
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:13,500
Only the ants can eat them.

711
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,600
This shop has a hole that the
ants can open by themselves.

712
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:19,400
Show it to me!!

713
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:20,080
This is a mist fan?

714
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:23,020
Look!!
The ants can open the hole by themselves.

715
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,640
I think that's a good idea!!

716
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:26,260
Wow, it's round.

717
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,020
Let the ants to approach here, please!!

718
01:54:28,021 --> 01:54:29,021
It's beautiful.

719
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:35,700
Oh, no.

720
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:43,680
Lift the chair.

721
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:47,380
Look this way.

722
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:53,900
Stick out the chair.

723
01:54:58,020 --> 01:54:59,580
She is drinking milk.

724
01:54:59,581 --> 01:55:00,981
She is holding a milk in her mouth.

725
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:10,340
Do you want to drink milk?

726
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:13,980
Yes, please.

727
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,660
She drinks milk.

728
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:19,560
She is very weak.

729
01:55:19,561 --> 01:55:20,561
It's amazing.

730
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,680
The dog is very careful.

731
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:27,420
He drank it.

732
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:31,320
He is going to drink it again.

733
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,040
Turn your face this way.

734
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:47,140
Turn your face this way.

735
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:50,920
Look, there's a lot of them.

736
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,020
There's a lot of them.

737
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:54,000
Look, look, look.

738
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,860
Look at this.

739
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,340
Wow, that's amazing.

740
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:01,560
Can you move your hand?

741
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:03,860
Look, look, look.

742
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:07,860
Look over here.

743
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,280
There's a lot of them, right?

744
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:14,600
How do you feel?

745
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,200
I'm weak.

746
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:17,201
Are you happy?

747
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:21,200
This side, too.

748
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:26,640
This side, too.

749
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:28,700
Open your mouth.

750
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,360
To the back.

751
01:56:38,361 --> 01:56:39,361
I'm sorry.

752
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,200
I'm sorry.

753
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:43,340
I feel good.

754
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:44,660
Look at me.

755
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:46,520
Look at the camera.

756
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,320
I'm slacking off.

757
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,100
You are a big guy.

758
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,080
I'm sorry.

759
01:56:53,745 --> 01:56:55,180
I'm sorry.

760
01:56:55,181 --> 01:56:56,980
I'm sorry.

761
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:05,300
I'm sorry.

762
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:11,260
Let's move that.

763
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:19,400
Do you want to go in?

764
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,860
That's right.

765
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:23,820
Do you want to go in?

766
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,860
That's right.

767
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:26,360
Good.

768
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,640
He licks at the same time.

769
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,400
That's great.

770
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,340
It's very efficient.

771
01:57:35,341 --> 01:57:36,341
Great!

772
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,090
You have two of them.

773
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,520
Great!

774
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:41,940
Hurry up!

775
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:44,300
Hurry up!

776
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,560
I'll give you a bath.

777
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:51,100
Look down.

778
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,900
Yes, yes, yes.

779
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:55,901
Take a breath.

780
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:57,420
Come closer.

781
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,560
Do like this.

782
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,420
Move your head.

783
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:07,660
I'm so happy.

784
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:14,880
Move your head.

785
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:22,660
Open your eyes.

786
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:27,200
I'm going to do it while
looking at everyone's nipples.

787
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:28,361
I'm going to do it from here.

788
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,760
There is a change.

789
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:44,160
You don't have much experience, do you?

790
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:49,060
Is it okay to just shovel?

791
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,080
No, I don't want to.

792
01:58:53,090 --> 01:58:54,080
Do you want to do it?

793
01:58:54,081 --> 01:58:56,440
I don't want to go inside.

794
01:59:00,105 --> 01:59:01,340
I can't hear you.

795
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:15,640
Where do you want the electricity to go?

796
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:17,640
I don't want to go inside.

797
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,440
Good boy.

798
01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:29,340
I'll give you a treat.

799
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:41,620
You did a good job.

800
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:46,880
Don't you need a treat?

801
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:50,080
Here you are.

802
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:51,320
Look at the top.

803
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:57,180
Wow.

804
02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:03,430
It's good up to the eyes.

805
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:04,630
Wow.

806
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:06,270
It's beautiful.

807
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:06,930
It's good, isn't it?

808
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:08,230
Yes.

809
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,990
Wow.

810
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:21,890
It feels good.

811
02:00:41,810 --> 02:00:44,850
Look over there. Look over there.

812
02:00:44,851 --> 02:00:45,851
Look at her.

813
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:47,310
Look at her.

814
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:48,450
Everyone is looking.

815
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:51,490
Look at her.

816
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:56,130
I'll give you a massage.

817
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:57,890
I want to be a Butler.

818
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,660
Let's have a massage.

819
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,120
Here you are.

820
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,280
I'll give you a massage.

821
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:20,880
Oh, it's great.

822
02:01:20,881 --> 02:01:21,881
How do you feel?

823
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:25,720
It feels good, doesn't it?

824
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:29,770
How do you feel?

825
02:01:30,155 --> 02:01:31,410
It feels good.

826
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:44,220
It's done.

827
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:56,920
Let me see your belly.

828
02:01:57,570 --> 02:01:58,340
It's warm.

829
02:01:58,341 --> 02:01:59,341
I'm so scared.

830
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,460
It's not over yet.

831
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,540
I'm glad you let her breathe.

832
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,200
I'm going to inject her.

833
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,050
How do you feel?

834
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:31,390
I feel great.

835
02:02:31,391 --> 02:02:36,590
I'll let you go.

836
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:47,510
Let's go.

837
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,000
Look at the camera.

838
02:03:10,001 --> 02:03:11,001
Take a good look at her.

839
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:19,320
I think she has a lot to say.

840
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:22,200
Thank you very much.

841
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,340
It's not over yet, is it?

842
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,440
There's more to come.

843
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:52,220
It's painful.

844
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,840
I'm sorry.

845
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:03,740
I'm so sorry.

846
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,780
I'm so sorry.

847
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:16,290
You're great.

848
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:18,410
I'll put you in the box.

849
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:20,790
I'll put you in the box.

850
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:22,830
Are you ready?

851
02:04:23,370 --> 02:04:24,370
Yes.

852
02:04:24,570 --> 02:04:25,570
Here you are.

853
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:35,460
I'm so sorry.

854
02:04:35,461 --> 02:04:36,860
Let's get you out of here.

855
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:38,500
Get in there.

856
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,080
Let's go.

857
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,200
Lie down.

858
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:54,820
Put your legs up.

859
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:57,240
Thank you.

860
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:37,680
I'll help you.

861
02:05:40,681 --> 02:05:47,590
I'll do my best.

862
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:08,250
You're doing great.

863
02:06:11,635 --> 02:06:12,830
It's overflowing.

864
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:28,250
It's overflowing.

865
02:06:28,910 --> 02:06:31,510
Thank you very much.

866
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:37,030
Can you keep calm?

867
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:49,950
Please go back to sleep.

868
02:06:58,330 --> 02:06:59,150
You can keep calm.

869
02:06:59,151 --> 02:07:00,151
I want to go out.

870
02:07:00,490 --> 02:07:01,490
Please go back to sleep.

871
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:03,770
Please go back to sleep.

872
02:07:04,150 --> 02:07:05,630
I want to go out.

873
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:08,460
Tears are coming out... I could
hardly breathe, I was in such a state.

874
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:23,461
Oh, it's hard.

875
02:08:38,490 --> 02:08:39,690
Are you okay?

876
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,940
No, no, no.

877
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:00,600
Are you okay?

878
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:02,100
No, no, no.

879
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:03,560
Are you okay?

880
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:14,450
It's okay.

881
02:10:21,530 --> 02:10:26,650
It's amazing, isn't it?

882
02:10:38,050 --> 02:10:43,230
It's amazing, isn't it?

883
02:11:11,231 --> 02:11:12,391
I'm going to give you a bath.

884
02:11:40,870 --> 02:11:46,660
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

885
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:58,160
Raise your hips.

886
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:02,930
Raise your hips.

887
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:49,902
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

888
02:12:49,926 --> 02:12:53,097
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

889
02:13:12,231 --> 02:13:16,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

890
02:13:16,184 --> 02:13:20,113
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

891
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:49,410
I will leave the rest to you.

892
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:28,610
I am sure that the doctor
is going to be happy.

893
02:14:28,611 --> 02:14:30,110
Next, we are going to check the
respiratory condition of Yu-chan.

894
02:14:30,111 --> 02:14:30,150
Ahhh.

895
02:14:30,151 --> 02:14:35,200
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.

896
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:58,880
Ok, ok.

897
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:07,140
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.

898
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:46,990
You're doing great.

899
02:15:48,750 --> 02:15:50,230
You're doing great.

900
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:56,410
I'm sorry.

901
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,110
I'm sorry.

902
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:33,210
I'm sorry.

903
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:39,670
I'm sorry.

904
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:57,730
Kano, how does it taste?

905
02:16:58,650 --> 02:16:59,650
It's good.

906
02:17:00,410 --> 02:17:01,410
Do you like it?

907
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:02,450
Yes.

908
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:05,770
You look like you want to spit it out.

909
02:17:09,490 --> 02:17:12,410
Kano, do you want to spit it out?

910
02:17:12,890 --> 02:17:13,890
Yes.

911
02:17:14,490 --> 02:17:15,010
You must be thirsty.

912
02:17:15,011 --> 02:17:16,011
It's true, isn't it?

913
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:16,550
Yes.

914
02:17:16,551 --> 02:17:17,551
Then, everyone, please.

915
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:19,610
Yes.

916
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:21,290
Please let me out.

917
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:26,990
Please let me out.

918
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:29,150
More.

919
02:17:29,730 --> 02:17:30,730
More.

920
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:33,930
Please let me out.

921
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:38,750
Please let me out.

922
02:17:45,010 --> 02:17:49,920
Okay.

923
02:17:51,870 --> 02:17:52,870
Let's go.

924
02:17:54,950 --> 02:18:00,010
No more.

925
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:16,790
I'll leave it here.

926
02:18:52,565 --> 02:18:54,310
It's not enough, is it?

927
02:18:56,770 --> 02:18:57,770
I'll give you more.

928
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:27,350
Ahhhhh Ahhhhh.

929
02:19:41,550 --> 02:19:45,991
Two more people OK.

930
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:48,270
Open your mouth.

931
02:19:48,970 --> 02:19:49,990
You have to drink a lot.

932
02:19:53,490 --> 02:19:55,490
This is enough for you to vomit.

933
02:19:56,050 --> 02:19:57,370
Try to vomit.

934
02:20:04,470 --> 02:20:05,470
OK.

935
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:10,230
You have to drink a lot.

936
02:20:12,430 --> 02:20:13,790
Are you going to vomit?

937
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:15,970
Drink at the same time as you go.

938
02:20:50,250 --> 02:20:52,350
It's cold.

939
02:20:54,030 --> 02:20:54,750
How was it?

940
02:20:54,751 --> 02:20:55,751
It was delicious.

941
02:20:56,310 --> 02:20:57,310
That's good.

942
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:23,480
There are still a lot of
people who want to stay here.

943
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,660
I'll take her out.

944
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:45,260
I'm going to take her out.

945
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:54,830
Let's go.

946
02:22:04,650 --> 02:22:06,310
I'm going to take her out.

947
02:22:06,311 --> 02:22:07,311
Look at this.

948
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,740
Peek in to see if you can see.

949
02:22:12,741 --> 02:22:17,700
Ok, I'm going to put you in the room.

950
02:22:17,850 --> 02:22:19,780
You have a lot of feces.

951
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:26,820
I'm going to put you in the room.

952
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:51,660
I'm going to put you in the room.

953
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:36,020
I'm going to put you in the room.

954
02:23:50,170 --> 02:23:51,490
Do you feel good?

955
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:56,650
I'm sorry.

956
02:25:10,295 --> 02:25:16,040
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

957
02:25:16,064 --> 02:25:21,808

ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

959
02:25:27,601 --> 02:25:33,345
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

960
02:25:33,357 --> 02:25:39,105
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

961
02:25:39,129 --> 02:25:44,877
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

962
02:25:44,901 --> 02:25:50,648
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

963
02:25:50,672 --> 02:25:56,420
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

964
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:07,220
Please prepare a warm
towel and make a fire alone.

965
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:22,050
After warming the fire,
we pull out the firewood...

966
02:26:22,051 --> 02:26:24,411
...and prepare it to cook rice
and dish stock for 4 people.

967
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:29,690
This is the last stage, which refers
to a point whereblood isughing-alive.

968
02:26:29,691 --> 02:26:34,691
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

969
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:05,300
I don't know.

970
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:13,200
I don't know.

971
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:15,640
I don't know.

972
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:40,160
It hurts.

973
02:27:40,161 --> 02:27:40,320
It hurts.

974
02:27:40,321 --> 02:27:40,840
It hurts.

975
02:27:40,841 --> 02:27:41,841
It hurts!

976
02:28:20,630 --> 02:28:24,671
Ouch ouch ouch It hurts.

977
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:42,570

979
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:07,410
me I want to see you
move in by yourself.

980
02:29:30,370 --> 02:29:34,890
I can't breathe.

981
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:40,310
I can't breathe.

982
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:43,150
I can't breathe.

983
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:50,390
Oh!

984
02:29:51,510 --> 02:29:52,510
Oh!

985
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:03,970
Look at the next one.

986
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:06,170
We're waiting for you.

987
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:07,250
Turn your face this way.

988
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:11,730
Come on, hurry up.

989
02:30:13,190 --> 02:30:14,650
We're waiting for you.

990
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:18,610
Oh, my God!

991
02:30:27,855 --> 02:30:29,730
Oh, my God!

992
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:31,110
Oh, my God!

993
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:32,190
Oh, my God!

994
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:46,110
Put your hips up more and look at it.

995
02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:48,850
Oh, my God!

996
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:50,530
Look at it.

997
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:52,070
Look at the place where it comes out.

998
02:30:59,180 --> 02:31:00,960
You are still turning around.

999
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:45,470
You are still turning around.

1000
02:32:31,710 --> 02:32:33,190
I'm going to take you out.

1001
02:33:18,090 --> 02:33:22,270
It's still too early to get out of bed.

1002
02:33:25,970 --> 02:33:30,970
I'm afraid I can't help
it if I have to sleep.

1003
02:33:35,131 --> 02:33:36,771
There are still people who want to go in.

1004
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:41,670
I'm sure there are
people who want to go in.

1005
02:33:41,671 --> 02:33:42,770
I'll line them up.

1006
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:06,690
Open your legs.

1007
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:32,450
It's getting brighter and brighter.

1008
02:34:50,415 --> 02:34:53,415
Thank you very much.

1009
02:35:23,010 --> 02:35:29,070
The labor is getting harder and harder,
the pain is getting worse and worse.

1010
02:35:29,910 --> 02:35:35,990
There's still a lot of
people who want to go in.

1011
02:35:38,910 --> 02:35:41,210
It's too bad.

1012
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:50,150
Oh, no.

1013
02:35:50,151 --> 02:35:53,151
Oh, no...

1014
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:10,710
Oh, no...

1015
02:36:18,530 --> 02:36:20,130
I think my turn is over.

1016
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:25,790
How do you feel?

1017
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:33,910
It feels good.

1018
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:38,930
I feel good.

1019
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:40,360
Do you feel good?

1020
02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:16,490
Yes, I feel good.

1021
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:17,510
Your back feels good.

1022
02:37:17,670 --> 02:37:19,170
Yeah the back feels good.

1023
02:37:39,730 --> 02:37:40,930
I'm scared.

1024
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:54,630
I'm scared.

1025
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:55,990
I'm scared.

1026
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:43,330
I'm going to put it in.

1027
02:38:44,030 --> 02:38:45,030
I'm going to put it in.

1028
02:38:45,031 --> 02:38:46,031
Spread the blanket.

1029
02:38:53,710 --> 02:38:55,200
I'm going to put it in.

1030
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:05,190
I'm going to die.

1031
02:39:05,191 --> 02:39:06,191
I'm going to die.

1032
02:39:09,650 --> 02:39:10,790
I'm going to die.

1033
02:39:10,791 --> 02:39:11,791
I'm so tired.

1034
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:13,910
I'm already in this.

1035
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:16,370
I'm so tired.

1036
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:30,060
I'm so tired.

1037
02:39:43,550 --> 02:39:44,550
I'm hungry.

1038
02:39:45,310 --> 02:39:46,310
I'm hungry.

1039
02:40:03,020 --> 02:40:04,400
I'm hungry.

1040
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:10,510
I'm hungry.

1041
02:40:16,970 --> 02:40:17,970
I'm hungry.

1042
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:36,940
Put all the rice in the bowl.

1043
02:40:36,941 --> 02:40:41,940
You have to suck it all in.

1044
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:24,340
I gave you a lot.

1045
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:36,400
What's wrong?

1046
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:40,180
What's wrong?

1047
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:42,960
The baby is crying.

1048
02:41:54,410 --> 02:41:57,090
In addition, a lot of blood
is coming out of this baby.

1049
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:14,120
The baby is suffering from a lot of blood.

1050
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:18,360
The baby is crying.

1051
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:23,040
The baby is crying.

1052
02:44:11,170 --> 02:44:12,890
The baby is crying.

1053
02:44:12,891 --> 02:44:13,891
I'm sorry.

1054
02:44:14,130 --> 02:44:17,130
You want it, don't you?

1055
02:45:47,270 --> 02:45:51,530
You're shaking, but you're not moving.

1056
02:47:03,490 --> 02:47:04,490
Ouch!

1057
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:13,630
You're so annoying.

1058
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:12,640
I'm sorry.

1059
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:16,260
Don't be so stiff.

1060
02:49:17,930 --> 02:49:19,320
I don't have it.

1061
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:22,280
Give it to me.

1062
02:49:22,281 --> 02:49:25,281
Thank you so much for taking care of me.

1063
02:49:44,720 --> 02:49:47,160
I'm so happy that I was able
to give birth to so many babies.

1064
02:49:49,730 --> 02:49:51,970
Thank you so much.

1065
02:49:53,650 --> 02:49:54,690
Raise your head.

1066
02:49:55,470 --> 02:49:56,470
Raise your head.
