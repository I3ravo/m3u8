1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,840
That was fun.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,520
I can't do it anymore.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,460
What?

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,420
I can't do it anymore.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,180
You can't do it
anymore? That's right.

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,580
I'm going to die.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,850
You can die.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,200
Thank you.

9
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,201
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,750
I'm the target of the director's criticism.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,550
What am I doing?

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,970
Thank you again today.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,830
Thank you.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,310
I'm Hakushu, a judge.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,090
I'm Karen.

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,290
Thank you.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:48,470
Thank you.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,510
Did you hear the story of this work today?

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,350
Well, I don't know.

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,190
It's okay to eat as it is.

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,250
Thank you.

22
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:19,370
I wanted to find out what kind of person
Kaede Karen is, so I decided to do it.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,049
Today, I'm not going
to talk about the script,

24
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:30,170
but I'm not going to talk
about my performance.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,561
After this, I'm going
to go to a nearby love

26
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:40,930
hotel and have a one-on-one
shoot with the actor.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,310
I haven't decided the time yet.

28
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,311
I don't know yet.

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,090
Maybe next week.

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,950
I don't know.

31
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,750
I may not be in this industry next time.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Love Hotel.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,250
One body, Karen-san.

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,850
One actor, one camera.

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,030
What do you think it will be like?

36
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,910
If you could tell me in private,

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,661
do you ever go to a
love hotel? Occasionally.

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,130


39
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:24,910
Occasionally? I see.

40
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,090


41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,491
I'd like to see you in a love hotel.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,390
If a miracle happens,

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,310
and I go to a love hotel with you,

44
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,910
If something like that happens,
I'm sure it's going to be like this.

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,630
I'm so happy. It's been a long time.

46
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm sure it's the same for everyone.

47
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,130
I'm sure if you try to
do this, it's not easy.

48
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm sorry, I didn't
prepare any clothes today.

49
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,210
I asked you to wear new clothes.

50
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,250
It's so cute.

51
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,650
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,170
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,630
I'm afraid I'll get hungry if I eat.

54
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,270
No, you don't have to.

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,221
How did you feel when
you went to the Love Hotel?

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
How did I feel?

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
If you could tell me.

58
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,170
I've never been there since lunch.

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:47,186
I don't know if it's a little exciting

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,950
Well, I don't know.

61
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:19,350
I wait in the hotel alone
and the director comes to me.

62
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,910
You can do whatever you want.

63
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,179
It can be a pattern that
Karen-chan is waiting, or it can be a

64
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:32,830
pattern that you wait in front
of the hotel and enter together.

65
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,150
What should I do?

66
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,650
Since it's a big deal, why don't we
enter the room together? That's right.

67
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,386
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

68
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,550
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

69
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:52,950
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

70
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,936
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,810
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

72
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:56,890
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

73
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,926
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

74
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,950
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

75
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,550
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

76
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:07,830
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

77
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,150
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

78
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,190
I think it would be better
if we went in together.

79
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,570
It's a beautiful place, isn't it?

80
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,010
Oh, it's a wiener.

81
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,950
I'm looking forward to the place
where you choose the wiener first.

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,930
I wonder what it is.

83
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,150
There are various meats.

84
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,510
I like people who are excited.

85
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,350
I see.

86
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,150
I have a question.

87
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,031
In your life, was there anyone
who wasn't excited? Yes, there was.

88
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,050


89
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,770
Really?

90
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:35,990
Yes.

91
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,510
Why? I want to know.

92
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,810


93
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,690
I want to know, too.

94
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,810
That's amazing.

95
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm glad to see people standing in
front of me, and I'm happy to announce it.

96
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,520
I see. That's great.

97
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Do you have the best situation in your life
or a situation that you still remember?

98
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
It doesn't have anything to do with love.

99
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,521
Do you have a favorite person,
regardless of whether it's a report or not?

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm happy to meet someone
who I can meet right away.

101
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

102
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,260
That's good.

103
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,900
Anyway, I think a cheerful
person is your favorite person.

104
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,610
I'm happy.

105
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,170
I'm glad to hear that.

106
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,647
I think there are a lot of
people who will answer anything

107
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,710
today, so please dye them
in the color of Karen-chan.

108
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,061
I would be happy if you could
dye the work in the color of Karen.

109
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:55,156
I think you'll answer
everything if you ask for it.

110
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,550
What?

111
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,610
A request? Please.

112
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:58,750
Please.

113
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,030


114
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,050
Like, it's not over yet.

115
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,450
I'm sure it's what we're
talking about right now.

116
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,650
Can you do it? I think I can.

117
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,310


118
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,210
I'm looking forward to it.

119
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:13,850
Thank you.

120
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,711
I'm really looking forward to it.

121
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,751
What I'm looking forward to is...
You're wearing your own clothes.

122
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,950
Of course, underwear.

123
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,950
I'm so sorry that I've
become a creepy old man.

124
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,470
I think you're the cutest.

125
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,630
Oh, really?
I'm really looking forward to it.

126
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,370
Thank you.

127
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Please have a meal.

128
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,870
I'm sorry. I was just talking.

129
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,630
Let's eat.

130
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,960
Do you have a favorite
food? I like potato.

131
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
That's good.

132
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,360


133
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,390
Do you eat a lot? Yes, I do.

134
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,150


135
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,330
What else do you like?

136
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm going to eat and go to bed.

137
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,980
I don't know.

138
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,140
I like to travel.

139
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,690
You are so cute.

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,910
You are so cute whatever you do.

141
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
It's delicious.

142
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,030
I'm full now.

143
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,650
Thank you for your hard work.

144
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,810
No, no.

145
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,370
It was just a little thing.

146
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,270
Are you all right?

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,830
From now on, I heard
that you are close to here,

148
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,410
so I would like to take a video of you.

149
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,790
Thank you very much.

150
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,530
Thank you.

151
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,590
Thank you.

152
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
You look so cute.

153
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Am I cute? Yes, you are.

154
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520


155
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,200
Wow, there is a hole.

156
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,000
Today, we are in a room suddenly.

157
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,040
A room suddenly?

158
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,400
Yes, that's right.

159
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,300
Shall we go to
Love4? Where? Here.

160
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,840
Let's go.

161
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100


162
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100


163
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Shall we go? Yes, I do.

164
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240


165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,440
Do you? Yes, I do.

166
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,441


167
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,860
What time is it? It's noon.

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,200
Yes, it is.

169
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,180
Is it still sunny? No, it's not.

170
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,520
It's noon, so it's not sunny.

171
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,460
I'm taking a video of you.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,220
Today, we are alone.

173
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Alone.

174
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,540
I'm going to take a video of you.

175
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Can I? A video.

176
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640


177
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,700
How about you, Hamedori?
Don't you have any?

178
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
I don't have any.

179
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,460
How about you, Toralei?

180
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm more embarrassed to be called Hamedori.

181
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Really?

182
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,220
Why are you embarrassed?

183
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,400
Isn't it more embarrassing
to be a full staff?

184
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,760
Isn't the camera too close?

185
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,160
That's what I'm talking about.

186
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,080
Look, it's like this.

187
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Is it close? Yes, it is.

188
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:34,080
Is it close? Yes, it is.

189
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,180
I'm going to take a lot of
erotic pictures with this.

190
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,100
Let's go.

191
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,840
It's amazing.

192
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:53,940
This room is amazing.

193
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,480
What kind of book
is it? I don't know.

194
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,860


195
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
It's a book about butt.

196
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,820
How do you feel when you see my butt?

197
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,040
Oh, it's that way.

198
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,280
I thought you were going to stand back.

199
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,690
But you didn't.

200
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,610
It's amazing.

201
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
This is a great room.

202
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,460
The bath is purple.

203
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,760
I want to take a bath in the purple light.

204
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,220
You can do whatever you want today.

205
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:45,240
This is a free style, so you
can do whatever you want.

206
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Whatever I want?

207
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,790
Yes.

208
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,040
Look at this.

209
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
It's a mirror.

210
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
Oh, it's true.

211
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Can you see it? It's a mirror.

212
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,300


213
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,340
Is that a good one?

214
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:10,800
Can you wrap this around your neck later?

215
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,000
Wow!

216
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,540
You can do whatever you like.

217
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Is the switch on? It's on.

218
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,770


219
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,900
Why is it so cute?

220
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,490
You ordered it in advance, didn't you?

221
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,930
I'll give it to you later.

222
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,870
Can I?

223
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,450
Is it a costume? Yes, it is.

224
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,890


225
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,550
You said something, didn't you?

226
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,370
It's a cute one.

227
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
Great.

228
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Is it good?

229
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,660
Oh, there's a mirror down there.

230
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,400
That's right.

231
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:36,200
Oh, you are right. If you don't
wear panties, you will fall down.

232
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,480
It's embarrassing.

233
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,830
You will get wet.

234
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,230
Really?

235
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,190
You will get wet.

236
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,210
There is no one here.

237
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,010
You are so beautiful,
aren't you? No, I'm not.

238
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,070


239
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,190
No one is hiding.

240
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,550
I thought only you and I were beautiful.

241
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,710
You are so beautiful.

242
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:03,711
What should I do?

243
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,790
You can do like this.

244
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,791
What's wrong with you?

245
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,540
What kind of sex do you like?

246
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,930
Iccha-iccha?

247
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,270
Iccha-iccha?

248
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,810
What is Iccha-iccha?

249
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,410
Do you mean to stick together?

250
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,190
Don't be mean to me.

251
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,490
What? Oh my gosh.

252
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,030


253
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,170
Don't you get angry?

254
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,490
No.

255
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:48,130
I've been curious about this for a while.

256
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,150
It's torn.

257
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,450
Yes.

258
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
What on earth is this? Look.

259
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,330
Ah! It hurts.

260
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,450
It hurts.

261
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,770


262
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,270


263
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:07,490
It's hot, isn't it?

264
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,290
It's hot, isn't it?

265
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,870
It feels good, doesn't it?

266
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,110
It feels good, doesn't it?

267
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:30,150
Maybe it's not wet.

268
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:30,990
Maybe it's not wet.

269
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:31,830
I don't have anything on me.

270
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,890
What?

271
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I don't like it.

272
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,740
I took off my shirt, too.

273
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,130
It's hot.

274
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,370
I got hot in an instant.

275
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,950
It's been a while since I've seen
you, so I'm a little embarrassed.

276
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,450
It's been a while.

277
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,290
It's been a while, hasn't it?

278
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,700
I've never seen you like this before.

279
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
You're cute.

280
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,500
You're cute, too.

281
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
Let's put this over here.

282
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,670
You're thin.

283
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,671
Oh, I see.

284
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,110
Did you eat a potato
just now? No, I didn't.

285
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,770


286
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,570
You didn't, did you?

287
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,130
You look like you did.

288
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,750
Did you eat it? No, I didn't.

289
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,410
Are you sure? I'm sure.

290
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,990
Isn't that a bra?

291
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,290
What's that?

292
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,350
If you take it off, you'll have boobs?

293
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,030
Yes.

294
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,210
Really?

295
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,340
If you take it off, you'll have boobs.

296
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,950
If you take it off, you'll have boobs.

297
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,710
Oh, you are here.

298
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,810
You are here.

299
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Let me see your face.

300
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Are you embarrassed?

301
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,710
Are you embarrassed?

302
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,030
You look cheerful.

303
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,210
You look cheerful.

304
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,490
Let's shave your beard later.

305
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,130
Let's shave your beard later.

306
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,325
Do you want me to do more?

307
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,230
Yes.

308
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,990
Are you embarrassed?

309
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,270
Wow, you are great!

310
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,470
Wow, you are
great! You are sullen.

311
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,390
You are sullen.

312
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,391
You sit here.

313
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,630
You are erotic.

314
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:50,560


315
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,680
You have two dumplings.

316
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:53,681
There are two cats.

317
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,140
Hey, hey.

318
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,880
Does it hurt? It's cold.

319
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:05,900
Hey, hey.

320
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,660
It's stained.

321
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,280
I wonder if I can touch it.

322
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,620
You've only touched it a little.

323
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,080
I don't have anyone,
so you can say anything.

324
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,060
It's not embarrassing
because it's just the two of us.

325
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,220
What are you going to do?

326
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,850
I don't know what you're doing right now.

327
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,060
Look, this is all I can see.

328
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,341
I'm going to give you a massage.

329
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,380
What's wrong with you?

330
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,550
What's wrong with
you? I was licked.

331
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,830


332
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,930
Are you sure?

333
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,870
Can I look at you? I'm sorry.

334
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,410


335
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,900
You have a finger in your eye.

336
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,220
Do you understand?
It's messed up.

337
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,520


338
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,100
It's embarrassing if you stand there.

339
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,760
If I stand there? It's so high.

340
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,221
It's getting round.

341
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,760
What?

342
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,380
Like this?

343
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
Yes.

344
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
It's high.

345
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Are you OK? Barely.

346
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460


347
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Barely safe?

348
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,940
Isn't it erotic? Open your legs.

349
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680


350
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,940
Can I look at you? Look at me.

351
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760


352
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,360
What is this? It's a strange feeling.

353
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,450
Are you embarrassed to be taken like this?

354
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,770
No.

355
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,870
Are you excited?

356
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,680
What should I do? Be careful.

357
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,150
Come here.

358
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:43,190
Take off your pants.

359
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,640
What makes you want to have sex?

360
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,660
What makes me want to have sex?

361
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,700
I like talking to you.

362
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,260
I like talking to you, too.

363
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,080
When we get married, I feel
like I want to do something erotic.

364
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,361
I feel like I want to touch you.

365
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,050
Then, I'll touch you.

366
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,380
My ears are getting up.

367
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
Are you getting up?

368
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,980
Your neck is getting up.

369
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,300
Did you put your finger in it?

370
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:09,210
Is it a good one?

371
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:35,220
Which one do you like?

372
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
This one?

373
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Both

374
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
This one? I love you.

375
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,260


376
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:02,520
Are you shy? I love you.

377
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200


378
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,940
Look at the camera.

379
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
Where are you
touching? I love you.

380
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040


381
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,200
It's cold, isn't it? It's okay.

382
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740


383
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,050
I'm taking off your clothes.

384
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Tell me.

385
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,980
You're getting sleepy.

386
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:06,981
You are getting sleepy.

387
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,440
You are so sleepy.

388
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,160
Look at this.

389
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,220
You are amazing.

390
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,760
You are so sleepy.

391
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,160
How do you feel? I feel sleepy.

392
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960


393
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,200
Can you sleep a
little? Let's sleep.

394
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:39,330
I'm going to take
off my panties.

395
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:14,580
You are so mean.

396
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
What are you doing?

397
00:33:24,140 --> 00:34:03,200
Do you want to see my flat face?

398
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,080
No, I don't want to see it.

399
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:17,580
You don't want to see it?

400
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,300
This time, I'm going to show
you how to make a cute cat toy.

401
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm going to show you
how to make a cute cat toy.

402
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:40,580
I'm going to show you
how to make a cute cat toy.

403
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:42,542
I'm going to show you
how to make a cute cat toy.

404
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,511
I'm going to show you
how to make a cute cat toy.

405
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:30,300
I'm going to make a video of the process
of making a baby's first baby pillow.

406
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:58,300
I'm going to make a video of the process
of making a baby's first baby pillow.

407
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,698
This is a video I took when I was in the hospital for the first time in a long time

408
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,450
I'm here.

409
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,970
I've been thinking about it for a while.

410
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,770
There's something like a m, isn't there?

411
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,110
Is it wrong?

412
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,630
Is it right? I wonder.

413
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,170


414
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:42,650
Today, I will show you how to
remove hair on the back of the head.

415
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:44,766
I'll show you how to remove
hair on the back of the head.

416
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,951
Do you want to use something?

417
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,450
Finger?

418
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,650
What?

419
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,330
Finger?

420
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,866
Oh, you want to use your finger.

421
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,490
Phone.

422
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,710
Do you have a phone? Yes, I do.

423
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,510
My phone.

424
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,710
Great.

425
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,750


426
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,150
Are you going?

427
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:57,930
Yes.

428
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,350
Are you going right now?

429
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,390
Yes.

430
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,826
Do you want me to bring it to you?

431
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,450
Yes.

432
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,510
I'll bring it to you.

433
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,210
Do you have it? Yes, I do.

434
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,330


435
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,690
Ta-da! Here you are.

436
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,570
It's cool.

437
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,110


438
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,090
There are various things.

439
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,810
There is a black one.

440
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,790
What is this?

441
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,850
It's a vacuum cleaner for chestnuts.

442
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,270
Can I put it in?

443
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,151
You can put it in and
vacuum the chestnuts up there.

444
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,610
Are you interested?

445
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,650
Which one do you like?

446
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,690
Do you want to try it?

447
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:40,905
Which one do you like?

448
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,391
Today, I will show you the sliding door.

449
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,120
I think this is a very
comfortable sliding door.

450
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,480
When you press the button
to move the door, it slides.

451
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:25,685
It smells good.

452
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,110
It's good.

453
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:39,591
You've been in there for a long time.

454
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,890
It's good, isn't it?

455
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,370
What is this?

456
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,480
Do you want to make it stronger?

457
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,620
Do you want me to make it the strongest?

458
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,000
No, I don't want you
to make it the strongest.

459
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,680
Why?

460
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,110
Then, I'll do it this way.

461
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,560
I'll do it like this.

462
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Look.

463
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:16,450
Please see review 109597
on PissedConsumer.

464
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:29,200
com My husband
and I had a lot of fun.

465
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
The day before yesterday,
we were just having fun.

466
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,510
I had a lot of fun, too.

467
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:44,530
It was a good day.

468
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:44,830
We were having fun.

469
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:49,710
I don't know if I can say this, I can't say
this, I can't say this, I can't say this,

470
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,070
but I can't say this.

471
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:56,660
But we laughed a lot.

472
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:56,800
I can't say this,

473
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,920
but I can't say this,

474
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,400
She is about to give birth.

475
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:07,856
What if I don't stop after I give birth?

476
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,160
What?

477
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,780
What if I don't stop after
I give birth? She will die.

478
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,000
Look.

479
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320


480
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,070
I'm not going to stop.

481
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,110
OK?

482
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:33,230
It's been a long time since I've
had a baby, so I'm a little worried.

483
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,670
I'm worried about my baby's health.

484
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,210
I'm worried about my baby's health.

485
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,211
Can I have some water?

486
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,530
Yes.

487
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Thank you.

488
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,200
Here you are.

489
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:56,201
Thank you.

490
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,651
Actually, I'm embarrassed to be seen.

491
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,080
I'm embarrassed.

492
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,290
Can I take a picture of you?

493
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,370
Yes.

494
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:20,210
The baby cat is calling her name.

495
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,391
The baby cat is confused
with the name of his mother.

496
00:46:50,185 --> 00:47:04,340
I put a camera in my son's room.

497
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,891
He is in a hurry to see the camera.

498
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:44,740
He is very nervous when he sees a camera.

499
00:47:44,890 --> 00:48:04,500
I'm sorry I couldn't help my baby.

500
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:22,210
Oh, you wanted to lie down.

501
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:24,830
Come here.

502
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,180
Look at me.

503
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,350
You can go inside.

504
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,390
What's wrong?

505
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,740
You were grunting.

506
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,190
You were grunting.

507
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,340
You were grunting like this.

508
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,940
You are amazing.

509
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,480
You are surprised, aren't you?

510
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,371
Once you go to the vet, it's easier to go.

511
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,160
Do you think so? You are cute.

512
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,120


513
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,900
You are upside down.

514
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:15,563
This is the first time
I've ever seen a cat like

515
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:24,400
this, and I'm very happy
that he's doing so well.

516
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:30,930
I'm glad he's doing well.

517
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,050
I'm glad he's doing well.

518
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,760
When I was young, I was very
curious about the world of cats.

519
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,520
I'm not good at interacting with people, so
I'm not good at communicating with people.

520
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,610
I love this place.

521
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:26,540
Let's move a little forward.

522
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,380
What do you like, Taiyo?

523
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,900
I like this bench.

524
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,120
I see, that bench.

525
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:52,121
That's a great butt.

526
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,436
You can put three of them on it.

527
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,840
Yes, I can.

528
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,160
Let's go there.

529
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,140
Put your hand on your butt.

530
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:01,141
Look at this.

531
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,100
Look at this.

532
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:04,101
I have four butts.

533
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,840
Four butts?

534
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,860
Can I put this in the back?

535
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,840
Can I put this in the back?

536
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,260
Can I put this in the back?

537
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,261
I have four butts.

538
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,080
Can I?

539
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,440
What are you going to do?

540
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,880
What?

541
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,120
I'm going to do this.

542
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,471
Are you going to do this with four people?

543
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,620
It's dangerous, isn't it?

544
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:39,410
This is the first time
I've ever seen a baby

545
00:53:39,422 --> 00:53:44,410
in a wheelchair, so
I'm a little nervous.

546
00:53:44,490 --> 00:54:15,170
I'm going to have to put
a lot of pressure on you.

547
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,840
You like the back, don't you?

548
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,400
Do you like the back?

549
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:42,401
Do you like it?

550
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,100
What are you looking at?

551
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,990
Have you ever seen your
own face in the mirror?

552
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,550
No.

553
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:20,920
You are dizzy.

554
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,000
Do you want some water?

555
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,960
No.

556
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,640
You don't need it?

557
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:25,660
No.

558
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,540
I'll bring it to you.

559
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:03,570
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

560
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:16,930
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

561
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:18,491
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

562
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,320
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

563
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:47,020
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

564
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,720
It's hot.

565
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,820
It's hot, isn't it?

566
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,700
Do you want to cool down?

567
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,420
Do you want to cool
down? Here you are.

568
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,060


569
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,280
Let's take a break.

570
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,470
It's purple.

571
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,750
It's going to be in the purple liquid.

572
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,530
The phone is waterproof.

573
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,396
If you want, I can bring it.

574
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,870
Wait a minute.

575
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,670
I'll bring it.

576
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,730
It's warm.

577
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:18,230
Do you like it?

578
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,950
Yes.

579
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,630
What are you doing?

580
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,890
Did you forget to wash your face?

581
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,830
Did you forget to wash your face?

582
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:40,930
Did you forget to wash your face?

583
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,090
Really?

584
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,390
Wow!

585
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,830
Wow!

586
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,470
Wow, it's amazing.

587
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:58,850
I've never seen it in the water.

588
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,610
You can't see it in the water.

589
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,850
It's different from this.

590
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,970
I've never used it in the bath.

591
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,290
It's totally different,
isn't it? It feels good.

592
00:59:16,225 --> 00:59:28,400
You are so erotic that I can't help
but tickle you while looking at you.

593
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:51,590
Don't move.

594
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:06,350
I am watching a video of a baby cat.

595
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:21,010
Baby cat is asleep.

596
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,050
He is sleeping deeply.

597
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:42,480
I am watching a video of a baby cat.

598
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:43,481
He is sleeping deeply.

599
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:16,720
I went to the daycare center
and they gave me a hand sanitizer.

600
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,160
It's a bit funny.

601
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Are you okay?

602
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:53,610
Don't let go of the teddy bear.

603
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,250
You can leave it.

604
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:02,590
Tell me when you leave.

605
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,150
It's hot, isn't it?

606
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,310
It's hot, isn't it? It's hot.

607
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,860


608
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,870
It's good temperature.

609
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,500
It's fun.

610
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,540
Have you ever had a shower?

611
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,440
Since you were a child.

612
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,740
Wow!

613
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,440
What?

614
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,441
Wow!

615
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,580
This is not a bath.

616
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,820
Wow!

617
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,440
Everyone is not like that at first.

618
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,360
Do you understand?

619
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,260
I'm a little nervous.

620
01:04:17,261 --> 01:04:20,022
It's been a long time since I've
had a bath, so I'm a little nervous.

621
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,650
Do you need a bath bomb?

622
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,350
Do you need water?

623
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:22,780
It's been a long time
since we had sex, hasn't it?

624
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,160
Yes.

625
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,000
How long does it take to
have sex in a private room?

626
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,300
10 minutes? 15 minutes?

627
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,400
It depends on the partner.

628
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:48,660
Do you want to go out?

629
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,820
Let's go to the bath tub.

630
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:26,970
I don't want to take a bath.

631
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,810
I'll let you take a bath.

632
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,580
I've never done it in the bathroom.

633
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,760
In the bathroom?

634
01:07:02,445 --> 01:07:12,180
You can wear it.

635
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,060
I rented it, so you can wear it.

636
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,020
Please wear it.

637
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,320
A beautiful girl.

638
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,140
A.

639
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,620
How about B?

640
01:07:27,621 --> 01:07:28,621
What do you think now?

641
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:35,700
If I post this on social
media, my fans will be happy.

642
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,680
Is that so?

643
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,940
Who posted it? Oh, this one.

644
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,500
This side.

645
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,660


646
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,350
Oh, this is the top.

647
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,250
This one?

648
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,020
How about this one?

649
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,700
Do you like A?

650
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,370
This one?

651
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,920
How about this one?

652
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,970
This one is good.

653
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,720
Like this?

654
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,940
Close your hand.

655
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:26,110
This is the narrowest one.

656
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,510
This one?

657
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,110
What about this one?

658
01:08:32,111 --> 01:08:37,110
Erika, this is Seino,
isn't it? This is Shin.

659
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:38,585


660
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,670
This is this kind of thing.

661
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,510
Can I take a video with my cell phone?

662
01:08:52,511 --> 01:08:53,350
You don't have to take it off.

663
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,490
I'm sorry.

664
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,870
It's OK.

665
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,350
You look like a fool.

666
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,050
You look like a fool.

667
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,250
You look like a fool.

668
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,191
When you come to school,
you will be told to go home.

669
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,570
Here we go.

670
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,490
Cheese.

671
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,110
Cheese.

672
01:09:24,305 --> 01:09:25,586
Do you have something like this?

673
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,430
Like taking a picture with a fan?

674
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:31,890
Well, not like that.

675
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:33,110
Like in a swimsuit.

676
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,670
Ah, yes.

677
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,061
When I say, I'll take a picture,

678
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,301
do you have a pose that you are good at?

679
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,231
You look like you're going to do your best.

680
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,080
It's great.

681
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:46,910
Look.

682
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,170
Do it again.

683
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,470
Do it again.

684
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,140
You look strong.

685
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,480
Your hair is so thin.

686
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,660
Because it's transparent.

687
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,560
You have a ribbon here.

688
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:20,840
Does it make you excited?

689
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:21,841
Do you have a microphone? I see.

690
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,880


691
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,120
I'll give you a microphone.

692
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Here you are.

693
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,960
Hello.

694
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Hello.

695
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,260
What are we going to shoot today?

696
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:41,160
What are we going to shoot today?

697
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:43,860
What are we going to shoot today?

698
01:10:43,861 --> 01:10:45,301
It's a shooting of a beautiful girl.

699
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,020
I'm going to defeat the enemy.

700
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:49,021
I'm going to bed.

701
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,940
Are you excited?

702
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:21,060
It's bright today.

703
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:31,270
It's a nice day.

704
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:01,940
Oh, it's open.

705
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,080
What are you doing?

706
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,780
If you do like this,

707
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,000
See?

708
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,720
Right?

709
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,340
Wow!

710
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:45,170
Ah!

711
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,350
It looks like a real one.

712
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:48,630
This is the real one.

713
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:50,610
Right?

714
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,700
A beautiful girl warrior.

715
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,900
A?

716
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,380
What are you doing now?

717
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,860
You look like a monster.

718
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,380
Do I look like a monster?

719
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,840
You are really beautiful.

720
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,600
You are quite tough.

721
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,100
How can I win?

722
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:54,770
How can you win?

723
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:56,630
How can I lose?

724
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,880
Do I lose if I show something?

725
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,100
Yes, you lose if you show something.

726
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:03,501
I really want to lose to you, Soso.

727
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:43,040
I want to put something
embarrassing in the video.

728
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,040
Can you see me? Yes, I can.

729
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,390


730
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,820
Can you see me? A little more.

731
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:17,980
A little more?

732
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,670
Oh, no!
I'm going to lose to you, Captain Ishioda.

733
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:33,670
I'm going to lose.

734
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,640
I'm going to lose.

735
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,160
I'm going to make you sleep with me.

736
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,000
The baby is still in my arms.

737
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:14,390
I try to hold him with my hands.

738
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,920
But..

739
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,670
I try to hold him with my hands.

740
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,840
Are you okay?

741
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,170
Let me see your ears a little bit.

742
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:22,600
It's done.

743
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:58,700
You're rubbing your
chest, aren't you? I'm sorry.

744
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,680
It's okay, I'll rub it for you.

745
01:19:02,681 --> 01:19:03,720
It feels good.

746
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:28,750
But you like to rub your chest, don't you?

747
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:30,510
No? I got caught.

748
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,670
It's OK.

749
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,561
I'll rub your lower back.

750
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,280
Did you fall down?

751
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,040
Oh, you were carrying this.

752
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:39,540
That's great.

753
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,240
I didn't know you were in such a place.

754
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,600
I'm scared.

755
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,780
That's terrible.

756
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:51,520
【Cat's name is Romantic
Cat, but I call it Romantic Cat.

757
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:52,721
】 Romantic Cat has a cat's name.

758
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,616
Romantic Cat doesn't have a
name, so I call it Romantic Cat.

759
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,080
Romantic Cat's name is Romantic Cat.

760
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:27,020
Romantic Cat has a cat's name.

761
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:50,390
Oh, my goodness! Look at her.

762
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:13,670


763
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:15,630
Wow!

764
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,591
She is flying like a beautiful girl.

765
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,180
I wonder if she is
going to be a street cat.

766
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,840
Are you worried about her?

767
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:54,740
Do you hate having a
lot of sex? No, I like it.

768
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,360


769
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:57,960
What? I like it.

770
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,060


771
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,140
I don't like it.

772
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:05,930
What?

773
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:23,240
I don't like it.

774
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:26,940
I'm going to sleep.

775
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,400
I'm going to sleep.

776
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:34,560
I'm going to sleep.

777
01:25:34,561 --> 01:26:29,400
Mama and Mama's voice
and voice are the same.

778
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:34,680
It's a situation where the baby's
voice is heard at the same time.

779
01:26:34,681 --> 01:26:38,300
I'm talking about the voice of the baby.

780
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:53,150
I'm talking about the voice of the baby.

781
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,891
I'm talking about the voice of the baby.

782
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,210
Mom, I'm cold.

783
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:07,510
I brought you some water.

784
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:45,470
Today, I'm going to show you a
video of a baby who is about to cry.

785
01:28:45,471 --> 01:28:47,871
I'm going to show you a video
of a baby who is about to cry.

786
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,040
Today, I will show you how
to make a face mould of a cat.

787
01:29:24,215 --> 01:29:53,240
First, I'll show you how
to make a face mould.

788
01:29:53,241 --> 01:29:54,241
I'm sorry.

789
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:56,110
Why? I'm sorry.

790
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:02,190


791
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:04,570
Oh, you surprised me.

792
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,880
Does it hurt?

793
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,100
Yes.

794
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:41,710
Oh, you surprised me.

795
01:31:48,995 --> 01:32:21,500
Mom is having a hard time
breathing and her eyes are getting red.

796
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:23,180
I'm sorry.

797
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:24,980
I'm sorry.

798
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:25,180
I'm so sorry.

799
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,680
I'm so sorry.

800
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:35,630
I'm so sorry.

801
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,340
I'm so sorry.

802
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,880
I'm sorry.

803
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:46,740
It's wet.

804
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,180
What? It's wet.

805
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,840
I lost.

806
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:50,260
It's wet.

807
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,440
It was fun.

808
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:15,010
It's bright.

809
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:19,810
It's so bright.

810
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,961
This is the best.

811
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:53,720
Did you enjoy it? Yes, I did.

812
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:55,780


813
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:58,770
Were you excited?

814
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:00,580
Were you able to do it?

815
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,120
Yes, I was excited.

816
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,440
You got used to being a beautiful girl.

817
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,080
I'm a beautiful girl.

818
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:12,920
A beautiful girl.

819
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:20,770
You are sweating a lot.

820
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:22,270
Yes, I am.

821
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:23,271
I am wet.

822
01:34:24,275 --> 01:34:25,596
Because the humidity was so high.

823
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:27,790
You are right.

824
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:28,870
And you took a bath.

825
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,870
Yes, I did.

826
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,230
It was fun.

827
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,070
I can't do it anymore.

828
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,790
What?

829
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:38,750
I can't do it anymore.

830
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:39,510
You can't do it
anymore? Yes, I can't.

831
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:40,230


832
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:41,290
What?

833
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:42,291
I am going to die.

834
01:34:44,175 --> 01:34:45,175
You can die.

835
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:49,030
The police is coming.

836
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:52,890
It was fun, wasn't
it? It was fun.

837
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,010
It was fun, wasn't it?

838
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,361
Have you been filming this all the time?

839
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:03,530
All the time?

840
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:04,730
Yes, all the time.

841
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,750
Are you sleepy?
