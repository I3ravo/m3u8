1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,500
It looks like that.

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,620
Rio-chan, Rio-chan.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
Hello.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,360
Thank you.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,540
We are friends.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,300
We are friends.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,620
You are so cute.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,380
We are cute.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
We are three sisters.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,100
We are three beautiful sisters.

11
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,620
I'm looking forward to it.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,360
Your cute friends are cute,
aren't they? Yes, they are.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,420


14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,140
They are so cute.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's walk together.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,100
Let's go.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
It's like a cafe.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,180
They are cute, aren't they?

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,460
Ryo-chan is cute, too.

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,520
What's your friend's name?

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,500
What's my friend's name?

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,400
She is a college student.

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
A college student?

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Can I ask your name? I'm Jun.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm Gen.

26
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:57,481
I'm Rio.

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,620


28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,000
What's your name? I'm Erika.

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400


30
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,340
You are so cute.

31
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,960
You are unique and cute.

32
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,220
I'm Erika.

33
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
I'm Erika.

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
You have a good style.

35
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,660
I'm embarrassed.

36
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,300
People who are embarrassed
will not wear this, right? Erika is shy.

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,420
Erika is shy.

38
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,200
Erika is shy.

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,280
She is cute.

40
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:21,560
She is cute.

41
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,360


42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,160
She is flamboyant.

43
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,800
She is flamboyant.

44
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,820
They seem to get along very well.

45
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,976
They stand out from the crowd.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,980
Yes, they do.

47
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,420
Pay attention to them.

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,360
They stand out from the crowd.

49
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,521
I was worried about Rin-chan.

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,100
I was worried about her.

51
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,461
She is in the middle of the crowd.

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,060
She stands out from the crowd.

53
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,640
She stands out from the crowd.

54
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
White is not dirty.

55
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,340
White is not dirty.

56
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,520
If white is dirty, pink will be dirty.

57
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,540
They get along very well.

58
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,140
They get along very well.

59
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,080
Are you a college friend?

60
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,380
Yes.

61
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,760
It seems that you have been dating
since you were in elementary school.

62
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,560
I think so.

63
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,260
How long have you
been dating? About a year.

64
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,420


65
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,520
What is the reason?

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,820
Circle?

67
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:16,821
Do you want to
eat this? Yes, I do.

68
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860


69
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,480
I didn't know that three cute
girls are in the same circle.

70
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,180
I didn't notice at all.

71
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Do you want to
eat this? No, I don't.

72
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,340
It was green.

73
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:27,620


74
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
I didn't eat it.

75
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
It smells like avocado.

76
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:31,895
It smells like avocado.

77
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
That's right.

78
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,440
What does it taste
like? I don't know.

79
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:36,441


80
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,680
Is it a tennis
circle? Yes, it is.

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,640


82
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,340
Do you know tennis? No, I don't.

83
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,441
I only wrote my name.

84
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,800
Only your name?

85
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,760
Yes, only my name.

86
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,320
Only my name.

87
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,080
Rio-chan, you don't usually
talk like that, do you? No, I don't.

88
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,481
Because I'm not
attracted to you.

89
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
It's a sexual harassment.

90
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,060
Rio-chan, I know you.

91
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,640
Can you tell me your name?

92
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
My name is Erika.

93
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,520
Erika-chan.

94
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,880
My name is... She's
asking your name.

95
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,881
She is asking me.

96
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,880
This is Jun.

97
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Jun.

98
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,670
She is really.

99
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,540
I don't have any trouble with her.

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,380
She is taking a picture of me.

101
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Wait.

102
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Did you change your mind?

103
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,400
I don't have a button.

104
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,360
You don't have a button.

105
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
I want you to push it.

106
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,000
It is very far.

107
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,161
You can take a picture of me.

108
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
Can I? Yes, you can.

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640


110
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
It's good, isn't it?

111
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,850
Let's take a picture.

112
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,340
Do you want me to take a picture of you?

113
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,700
I think you can take a
picture of me by yourself.

114
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,420
It's okay.

115
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,200
I'll do it again.

116
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,300
You're not supposed to do this.

117
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:58,480
It's not like that.

118
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
You should say, It's okay.

119
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400


120
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,780
It's more important to be buried.

121
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,396
It's important to be buried.

122
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
It's a waste of data.

123
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,580
I don't erase it.

124
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm addicted to it.

125
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
It's cute.

126
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,620
Rio,

127
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,820
I wonder if it's
transmitted properly today.

128
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Yes.

129
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Maybe.

130
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,880
What did you say to me?

131
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:37,079
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to do it, but I'm going to do it

132
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,380
You've done it a lot?

133
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,260
Have you ever done it with
three people? Yes, I have.

134
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940


135
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
Really? Sometimes.

136
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200


137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
I don't do it often.

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,260
If the schedule doesn't match,
do you do it with two people?

139
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
I do it with two people.

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,180
Like this.

141
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,620
Rotation.

142
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,230
Rotation.

143
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,740
Rotation.

144
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,280
Rotation.

145
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:23,180
I think you already know.

146
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,840
What are you going to do today?

147
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Are you going to ask me?

148
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,780
What are you going to do?

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,580
What? What am I going to do?

150
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm going to say,

151
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,980
Wow!

152
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
Wow!

153
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,300
Wow!

154
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,960
Wow!

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
What are you going to do?

156
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
Are you going to ask me?

157
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,600
What am I going to say?

158
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,240
What are you going to do?

159
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Wow!

160
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,340
You don't guard your fans, do you?

161
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,770
I don't guard my fans.

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,280
I do erotic things.

163
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Really?

164
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,700
Are you OK, Eiko? I'm OK.

165
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,701


166
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,720
You are Ryo-chan's friend.

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
They are all crazy.

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
You are so cute.

169
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You are so beautiful.

170
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,460
Wait.

171
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,440
It's easy to drop it.

172
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,720
It's hard to eat.

173
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,500
But it's fun to eat.

174
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes, everyone is like a gyaru.

175
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,660
It's fun to eat and I like it.

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,220
You don't hate it,
do you? No, I don't.

177
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,500
I like it.

178
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:38,501


179
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,820
How about you? I like it.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000


181
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,980
What do you like?

182
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:45,260
What do you like?

183
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Especially?

184
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,100
Yes, especially.

185
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:50,520
You like Enchi?

186
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
Yes, especially.

187
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
What is your specialty? Eko-ki.

188
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,140


189
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Oh my god! That's amazing.

190
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,360


191
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,840
That's when the music stopped.

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,780
Eko-ki.

193
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,260
Oh my god.

194
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,880
That's amazing.

195
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:07,940
What?

196
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
Your hands are amazing.

197
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Do you tap?

198
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you tap?

199
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,001
Do you watch it? Yes, sometimes.

200
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260


201
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
How does it move?

202
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,960
It's like a piano.

203
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,640
It's smooth.

204
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,420
Smooth?

205
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, it's smooth.

206
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Sometimes I watch it.

207
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,040
What is your specialty, Rio?

208
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,740
What is your specialty, Rio?

209
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,020
My feet are like this.

210
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,740
What is that?

211
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:37,741
I've never done that.

212
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,900
My feet are like this.

213
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,950
My legs are soft.

214
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,540
My toes are so healthy.

215
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
My toes are messy.

216
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,200
Your toes are messy, don't
you think? Yes, they are.

217
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,920


218
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,260
You look like a ballon d'or.

219
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm messy.

220
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,030
That's the way to do.

221
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,081
You are messy even in a period of time.

222
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,580
People say my lips are loose.

223
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,801
They say my lips are loose.

224
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
It is said that it is loose.

225
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,440
I ate a lot and it is
loose around my mouth.

226
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,200
But, it is getting bigger.

227
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,460
I didn't know that.

228
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Can I ask you a question?

229
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes.

230
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Actually...

231
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
No.

232
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Really?

233
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:24,920
Yes.

234
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,276
What is your favorite flavor?

235
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,740
This is a cookie.

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,280
Everyone says it is a cookie.

237
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
So, I say it is a cookie.

238
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,041
It's called Koki-shibari.

239
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,140
If it's Koki, it's silica.

240
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Oh, I didn't know that.

241
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
We still have it.

242
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,180
We'll start when you say your name.

243
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,020
Say my name.

244
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Ushi? Ushi Naka.

245
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Naka.

246
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700


247
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,760
This is the best.

248
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
I love it.

249
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
I love it.

250
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,500
Do you like it?

251
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,680
Don't you want to wear it?

252
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to wear it.

253
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,460
I want to wear it.

254
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,760
We both feel good.

255
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
I was going to pick up the lottery.

256
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,140
It's too difficult to pick up the lottery.

257
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,141
What do you like? I like.

258
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,660
..

259
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,460
I like ears.

260
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,340
I like eyes.

261
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,380
You don't go out.

262
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,100
I want to go out soon.

263
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,870
I like outside.

264
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,740
Then, go out quietly.

265
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,900
Let me sleep.

266
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Come here.

267
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,260
It looks like a conditioner.

268
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,080
It's good for smooth skin.

269
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
It's smooth.

270
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,980
I'm tired.

271
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm going to write a letter of apology.

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,080
It's really hard.

273
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll take it.

274
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm going to write a letter of apology.

275
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm going to write a letter of apology.

276
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,100
I think I need more time.

277
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,740
It's hot.

278
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,240
Again.

279
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,241
I'm wearing a hat.

280
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm wearing a cap.

281
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
I'm going to call Yangan.

282
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,500
Where did you
buy this? Harajuku.

283
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860


284
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,220
It looks like it's going to sell.

285
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
Yangan? Okay.

286
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Let's do it.

287
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,860
Let's do it.

288
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,080
Let's do it.

289
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,081


290
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
Really? Let's do it.

291
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680


292
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Hey.

293
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Hey.

294
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,880
Ryo-chan is asking.

295
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Hey.

296
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Stop it.

297
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
Why are you suddenly
doing this? Stop it.

298
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,280
You are dirty.

299
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
You are dirty.

300
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,840
Pants.

301
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,221
I can see your underwear.

302
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,760
I can see your underwear.

303
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I can see your underwear.

304
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,920
What do you usually
look like when you start?

305
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,721
What do you usually
look like when you start?

306
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:28,340
When you are in a big group.

307
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,830
When I'm in a big group?

308
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
It depends on the person.

309
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,000
It depends on the person.

310
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,100
Do you have the best outfit?

311
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,960
The best?

312
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,000
What is the last one?

313
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,001
What is the last
one? I don't know.

314
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,640


315
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
6?

316
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
5?

317
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,340
Suddenly, everyone is...
Suddenly, everyone is... 6P?

318
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:00,700
6P?

319
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,140
4P?

320
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
4P?

321
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,020
You have few days, so do your best.

322
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,260
You can do it with both hands.

323
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,600
You can use your hands as much as you want.

324
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,280
I can do it in time.

325
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,700
You can do it in
time? You have legs.

326
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,420
I have legs.

327
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,836
You can use them
as much as you want.

328
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,180
I can use them as much as I want.

329
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,140
It's good.

330
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Leave me alone.

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,460
It's my first time to deal
with three people alone.

332
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm alone.

333
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,700
Come here.

334
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,720
Can I? Come here.

335
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,830


336
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,120
This pose is not good.

337
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
This pose is not good.

338
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,860
Do you want to take a rest?

339
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,100
Take a rest? Take a rest.

340
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620


341
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,780
What do you want to check?

342
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,140
What do you want to check?

343
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,420
What do you want to check?

344
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,820
What do you want to check?

345
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Who will be fit?

346
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,060
It's between us.

347
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
It's annoying.

348
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
It's annoying.

349
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,520
If you don't have the back of
your hand, you can do it like this.

350
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm stuck.

351
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm stuck.

352
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm stuck.

353
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm stuck.

354
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm stuck.

355
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,100
I'm stuck.

356
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm stuck.

357
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm stuck.

358
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:22,700
I'm stuck.

359
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm stuck.

360
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:23,741
I'm stuck.

361
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,500
I'm stuck.

362
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:25,100
I'm stuck.

363
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:25,560
I'm stuck.

364
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm stuck.

365
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm stuck.

366
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm stuck.

367
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,241
It's important.

368
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
She is not sitting down.

369
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
She is not sitting down.

370
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
I have to hold her down.

371
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,540
The baby's neck is coming off.

372
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Her neck is coming off.

373
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's not good.

374
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:49,855
She is standing up.

375
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
She is standing up.

376
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,060
She is standing up.

377
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
It's not good.

378
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It's true.

379
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
It's great.

380
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,260
She is the fastest.

381
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
She is fast.

382
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
I want to see your body.

383
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,140
I want to see you in this sexy outfit.

384
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,380
And this pink.

385
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Let's wear it.

386
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:14,535
I want you to wear it.

387
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,155
It's cute.

388
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,600
If you have a jacket,
why don't you take it off?

389
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,340
Take off my jacket?

390
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,940
I don't have a jacket.

391
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,700
It's too obvious.

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,300
You are so bold.

393
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,240
It's too obvious.

394
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:30,800
It's too obvious.

395
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:31,801
I can see it.

396
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
It looks like cabbage.

397
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,680
Lettuce.

398
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
Lettuce.

399
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,100
Can you see it?

400
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,520
I can't see anything.

401
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
I can't see anything.

402
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,800
I can't see anything.

403
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
This is the point.

404
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's in my stomach.

405
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,340
I want to wear it on my stomach.

406
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,340
On your stomach?

407
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,360
My stomach hurts.

408
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Harajuku is Harajuku.

409
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,920
Harajuku is Harajuku.

410
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,060
Harajuku is Harajuku.

411
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,061
Yes, it is.

412
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,340
I want to wear it on my stomach.

413
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,080
I want to wear it on my stomach.

414
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
On your stomach?

415
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,380
On my stomach?

416
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,160
I want you to show me your underwear.

417
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,320
Underwear?

418
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,680
Yes.

419
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,640
Underwear?

420
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,960
I want you to show me your top.

421
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
My top?

422
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,580
If you take off the
J, all of them will fit.

423
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,300
Oh, really? It's connected.

424
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680


425
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,060
Then, I'll take off the J.

426
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,460
Why?

427
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,940
I'll take off all of the J.

428
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,600
Judging from this relationship, if
you take off the J, all of them will fit.

429
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm serious.

430
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,920
I think this is better.

431
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
This is better.

432
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
I'll take off the J.

433
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Open J.

434
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,440
Why? I think J.

435
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,580
Y. Park has already seen it.

436
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
It's from Alitagoria.

437
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Wow.

438
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
That was quick.

439
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,780
I've only seen one.

440
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
That's good.

441
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
That's good.

442
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,860
Everyone has already seen the butt.

443
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I'm used to seeing it.

444
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I've seen it a lot.

445
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,100
Don't shake it.

446
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,300
I'm sorry.

447
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,460
Don't shake it.

448
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,980
It's a really good butt.

449
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,130
Stay still.

450
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,300
Manko is so cute.

451
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,520
Why?

452
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,220
Manko is so cute.

453
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,040
Not cute, Manko is cute.

454
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,720
Manko is cute.

455
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
We will see later.

456
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,000
We will see later.

457
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,940
She is so cute.

458
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,920
Let's go to the top.

459
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,020
Then, let's go together.

460
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,660
Not together.

461
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Let's go in order.

462
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
In order.

463
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Good butt.

464
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,140
Good butt.

465
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,160
This is a large one.

466
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,160
Is this large, too? It's big.

467
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,241
Here's the butt.

468
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
It's all right.

469
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,620
It's hard to see.

470
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,080
It's a part of the body.

471
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I love it.

472
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,440
It's like an alien.

473
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,020
It's big.

474
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
It's a good size.

475
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,380
Good.

476
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,160
It's not good name.

477
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,780
It's not good.

478
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,100
It's not good because I can't get in there.

479
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,820
Good.

480
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,620
Next.

481
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Next.

482
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,640
YANGA, take it.

483
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,760
I want to see.

484
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
YANGA, take it.

485
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,780
I want to see.

486
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:28,680
I want to see.

487
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,360
YANGA, take it.

488
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
I'm curious.

489
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
I'm curious.

490
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,040
I want to see.

491
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I'm so curious.

492
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,240
Ready, go!

493
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,660
I'll wash my hands.

494
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
I'll wash my hands.

495
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I'll wash my hands.

496
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
YANGA.

497
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,760
He is so cute.

498
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,761
It's so cute.

499
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,300
It's so cute.

500
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:44,500
It's so cute.

501
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:46,440
Where did you
buy it? It's so cute.

502
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,820
It's so cute.

503
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,920
It's so cute.

504
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,400
It's so cute.

505
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,480
It's so cute.

506
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,481
It's so cute.

507
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
It's so cute.

508
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,840
It's so cute.

509
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:08,120
It's so cute.

510
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,640
It's so cute.

511
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,780
It's so cute.

512
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:10,920
It's so cute.

513
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,480
It's so cute.

514
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,741
Let's stand in a line.

515
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,380
Look back.

516
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Butt.

517
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
Butt.

518
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,840
She is putting a tablecloth next to her.

519
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,980
She is trying not to push it out.

520
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
She is a bully.

521
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,780
She is the strongest in the middle.

522
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
She is crushed.

523
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,740
Butt.

524
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I'm surprised.

525
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,320
He is being pushed.

526
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,800
Who is pushing my head?

527
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,740
Let's make it smaller.

528
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,520
Put your knees on here.

529
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,720
It's OK. Support it with both feet.

530
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
What do you think?

531
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:12,560
Good girls have different colors.

532
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
What do you think? Right.

533
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,000
Like the color of
your underwear.

534
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Right.

535
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,700
Do you all do T-backs?

536
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Do you do basic
T-backs? Yes, we do.

537
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,020


538
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,240
Let's look forward this time.

539
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,330
If you look at my butt,
you will look forward.

540
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,020
Which side do you like? Front or back?

541
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,740
I like the back side.

542
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,740
But I want to look forward.

543
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Because it's a big deal.

544
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Because it's a big deal.

545
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Why? First J.

546
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,520
First J.

547
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,960
J cup? J cup's J.

548
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,320
J cup's J.

549
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,990


550
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
It's totally different.

551
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,860
But it's very soft.

552
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
It's totally different.

553
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,620
Is it weak?

554
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes, it's a service.

555
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
No.

556
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,580
Service.

557
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,160
J3.

558
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
J3.

559
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Then it's J cup.

560
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,060
No.

561
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,540
J3.

562
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,180
No.

563
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,360
No.

564
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
No.

565
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
First J.

566
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
It's Jikubi.

567
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
It's Jikubi.

568
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
It's Jikubi.

569
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,880
It's Jikubi.

570
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:36,600
It's Jikubi.

571
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:36,620
It's Jikubi.

572
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:39,060
It's Jikubi.

573
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,100
It's Jikubi.

574
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
It's Jikubi.

575
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,480
It's Jikubi.

576
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,740
It's Jikubi.

577
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,780
It's Jikubi.

578
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,420
It's Jikubi.

579
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:55,940
It's Jikubi.

580
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:56,060
It's Jikubi.

581
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,160
She is going to have a hard time.

582
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,780
A hard time?

583
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,080
Hurry up! Next!

584
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Next?

585
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,260
Jane doesn't go for a long time.

586
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,680
Jane goes fast.

587
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,920
She goes in order.

588
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
I see.

589
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,340
It's big.

590
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,780
It's big.

591
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,760
It's big.

592
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,460
But Jane doesn't have it.

593
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,180
It's big.

594
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,080
What did you buy?

595
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,081
G

596
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,061

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,581
It's big It's cute It's cute?

603
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,620
It's cuter than Manko

00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,980
It's cute

605
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,320
Paikawaii is in charge

606
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,020
I'm in charge of Paikawa.

607
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,300
So cute.

608
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You look like a hero.

609
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,000
Paikawa Pink.

610
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,240
Wait a minute.

611
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,740
You are the cutest character.

612
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
I'm going to the center.

613
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm going to get it.

614
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Yes.

615
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
I have to go where I can go.

616
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
I want a good role.

617
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Do you want?

618
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,020
I can't win the entertainment industry.

619
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
I'm sorry.

620
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,400
You don't have to be sorry.

621
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,100
I'm really sorry.

622
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,180
If you do it all at once,
your chest will hurt.

623
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,720
Are you okay?

624
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's not that bad.

625
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,360
No, it's thin.

626
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,780
It's thin.

627
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
It's a great neck.

628
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,280
I can't do it! I can't do it!

629
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:52,340
I can't do it! I can't do it!

630

635
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,860

do it! It feels good.

636
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,260
It feels good.

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,200
He is cute.

665
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,880

We grew up with the same boobs.

674
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,720
Paishiman.

675

A weapon?

685
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,680
You don't have a weapon.

686
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:08,900
Don't say that.

687
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,220

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,000
It's a trademark.

692
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,720
It's a trademark.

693
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:15,860
Are you going to take it off?

694
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:16,880
Are you going to
take it off? It's a little.

695
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,320
..

696
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,800
It's a little... It's a little... It's a
little... It's a little... It's a little...

697
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:22,000
It's a little... It's a little...
It's a little... It's a little...

698
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,040
It's a little... It's a little... It's a
little... It's a little... It's a little...

699
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:40,020
It's a little... It's a little...
Let's do it one more time.

700
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,380
One, two, three!

701
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,560
So cute!

702
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,260
I'm a little embarrassed.

703
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,700
But you can't come out when
you're helping your friends.

704
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,500
She's always coming out because she's shy.

705
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,200
Pink is the same, right?

706
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:05,700
Pink is really shy.

707
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,240
〔Their baby is crying.

708
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:08,241
〕 It's a baby pink.

709
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,840
It's a pink baby.

710
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,940
It's cute!

711
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Awesome!

712
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,720
What a cute baby.

713
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,560
It's a baby man.

714
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,360
The baby is wet.

715
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,780
He is wet and unable to use his strength.

716
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,470
He can't use his strength.

717
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,940
He can't use his strength.

718
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,460
He is about to use his strength.

719
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
The baby is crying.

720
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,820
I'm nervous.

721
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,160
I'm nervous.

722
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Why? Let's go.

723
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,300
Let's go.

724
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Let's go.

725
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm nervous.

726
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm nervous.

727
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
I'm nervous.

728
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,921
Do you feel good?

729
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Yes, I feel good.

730
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,080
I feel good.

731
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,180
I'm nervous.

732
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,180
What about you, Mako?

733
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,470
Well, I'm going.

734
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
You're not going
yet? No, I'm not.

735
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,660


736
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
I have to work hard.

737
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
You're not going yet?

738
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
I have to work hard.

739
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
I'm going.

740
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,530
I'm going.

741
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I'm going.

742
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm going.

743
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,820
I'm going.

744
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:18,180
I'm going.

745
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm going.

746
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:18,700
I'm going.

747
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm going.

748
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,820
I'm going.

749
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:21,860
I'm going.

750
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:21,940
I'm going.

751
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm going.

752
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:28,500
I'm going.

753
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
I'm going.

754
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,960
I'll be patient.

755
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,460
I'll be patient.

756
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,300
No.

757
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,060
No?

758
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
Is it hot? It's hot.

759
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
My face is red.

760
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,080


761
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,580
Right? It's hot.

762
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,460
It's hot.

763
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,180
It's hot.

764
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,700
It's hot.

765
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
She'll come out soon.

766
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
It's really hot.

767
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,700
It's really hot.

768
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Welcome.

769
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,790
She's coming from over there.

770
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
She's coming from over there.

771
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:02,440
I want you to come out soon.

772
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,356
Are you going to come out soon?

773
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,620
Are you going to come out soon?

774
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,640
She is coming out soon.

775
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:10,641
She is coming out soon.

776
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,640
Deja vu.

777
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Welcome.

778
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,100
Deja vu.

779
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,540
Deja vu.

780
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,980
It will be 100 years soon.

781
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,540
This is a 100-year-old mango.

782
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,000
This is a 100-year-old mango.

783
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,140
This is a 100-year-old mango.

784
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,280
This is a 100-year-old mango.

785
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:35,640
This is a 100-year-old mango.

786
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,920
This is a 100-year-old mango.

787
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:37,020
This is a 100-year-old mango.

788
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,140
This is a 100-year-old mango.

789
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
This is a 100-year-old mango.

790
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,960
This is a 100-year-old mango.

791
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,040
This is a 100-year-old mango.

792
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,540
This is a 100-year-old mango.

793
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,260
This is a 100-year-old mango.

794
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:54,261
What is ah?

795
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,260
What is ah?

796
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What is ah?

797
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:00,345
What is ah? Ah, it went in.

798
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,340
It went in.

799
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580


800
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,140
Please stop the video for a while.

801
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,220
I don't have a bath,
but is it okay? It's okay.

802
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,340


803
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,520
I've been bathing.

804
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,120
It's not easy.

805
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,880
J is the first to succeed.

806
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,120
It's not easy.

807
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:27,960
I'm not a little girl.

808
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,340
I'm not a little girl.

809
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,580
Chiku-taro looks lonely.

810
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
No, I'm not lonely.

811
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
I'm not lonely.

812
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,060
OK, I'm going to take off my top.

813
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Good bye.

814
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
I'm leaving.

815
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,340
I'm leaving.

816
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,140
Chiku-taro.

817
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,520
So cute.

818
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm leaving.

819
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,380
I'm leaving.

820
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,680
I'm leaving.

821
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:56,640
Look at them.

822
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
They are passing by.

823
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,080
They are kind.

824
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,500
It feels good.

825
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,660
She says it feels good.

826
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,780
Do more.

827
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,920
Do more on this side, too.

828
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,280
I'm touching you.

829
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
I'm touching you.

830
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm touching you properly.

831
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
It feels good.

832
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,600
It feels good.

833
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,800
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

834
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:52,801
I'm going to go.

835
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,740
I'm going to go.

836
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,000
I went there first.

837
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
I'm holding the camera now.

838
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,400
I went there first.

839
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,401
It hurts.

840
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:11,960
Yay! It hurts.

841
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
It's bad.

842
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,200
It's bad.

843
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,440
It's bad.

844
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,420
It's bad.

845
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,360
It's bad.

846
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:17,380
It's bad.

847
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,260
It's bad.

848
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:29,680
You are doing weird things
with doing your breath.

849
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:29,720
You are doing nonsense.

850
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:29,900
No, keep stop.

851
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,640
What kind of man is
this? It's a baghead.

852
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400


853
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,400
But, this is not bagged, it's a baghead.

854
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
How about yourself?

855
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,420
You are not chained.

856
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Like what?

857
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
You are a baghead.

858
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,880
Yes, I am.

859
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,160
My name is Nariman.

860
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
Chained.

861
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,380
You are like Chinedeman.

862
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:56,940
There is a vertical thread
and a horizontal thread.

863
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,360
This is a vertical thread.

864
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,900
This is a vertical thread.

865
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
People are connected.

866
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,120
Do you want to sing? Stop it.

867
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760


868
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,400
Do you mean the thread of man?

869
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:08,401
Yes, the thread of man.

870
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
The thread of man.

871
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I'm going to pee.

872
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
The thread of man.

873
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Well, let's eat.

874
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,360
The thread of man.

875
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Let's eat.

876
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,580
Let's eat.

877
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,540
Let's eat.

878
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:20,700
Let's eat.

879
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:21,720
Have a nice day!

880
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,820
I can't stand up.

881
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I can't stand up.

882
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,740
I don't have time to rest.

883
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,160
You are so cute.

884
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
You are so cute.

885
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,100
You are doing great.

887
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
You are doing great!

888
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,080
You are doing great!

889
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:52,081
Oh, you are drooling.

890
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
You are doing great!

891
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,480
You are doing great!

892
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,680
Oh, it feels good.

893
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,380
Oh, you are panting.

894
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,287
This is the first time I've ever seen
a baby crying in front of me, so I'm a

895
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:56,920
little nervous, but I'll do my best to
make the video fun and enjoyable for you.

896
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,960
I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy
it, so please look forward to it.

897
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:58,961
Three-man-ko? Three-man-ko.

898
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,750


899
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,220
Then, self-man-ko.

900
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Self-man-ko?

901
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Let's do self-man.

902
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,580
Self-man.

903
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,660
You are good at self-man.

904
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,600
Self-man.

905
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,460
Self-man.

906
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Ecchi.

907
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Ecchi.

908
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,640
Stop it.

909
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:24,641
I can't open my eyes.

910
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,700
I can't open my eyes.

911
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,060
I can't open my eyes.

912
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:35,460
I can't open my eyes.

913
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,960
I can't open my eyes.

914
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:47,600
I can't open my eyes.

915
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,640
I can't open my eyes.

916
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,641
I can't open my eyes.

917
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:05,000
I am a little worried about
my daughter's health.

918
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,560
I am worried about her going to a hospital.

919
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:11,576
I am worried about her going to a hospital.

920
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,420
I am worried about her going to a hospital.

I'm going to the bathroom.

925
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,380
It feels good.

926
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,770
Oh, my God.

927
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,550
I'm going to the bathroom.

928
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:14,370
Are you going to go,
Selma? It feels good.

929
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,590


930
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,530
Are you going to go,
Selma? It feels good.

931
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:42,000


932
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,680
She's going, she's going.

933
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:01,201
She's going, she's going, she's going.

934
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,380
She's gone.

935
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,360
It feels good.

936
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
She's gone.

937
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,900
Do you use toys?

938
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,700
I don't use toys.

939
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:19,701
Do you use toys?

940
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Toys? I like toys.

941
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,850
I like toys.

942
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,180
I like toys.

943
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:26,900
I like position changes.

944
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,680
Do you want me to put it in the middle?

945
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,436
Do you want me to put it
in the middle? In the middle.

946
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460


947
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,480
I put it in the middle.

948
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,260
What kind of toys do you have?

949
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,460
What kind of toys?

950
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:41,160
I have a lot of toys.

951
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
You have a lot of toys.

952
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,820
I have a lot of toys.

953
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,540
I think this one is better.

954
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,840
Which do you like better?

955
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,140
I like this one.

956
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,080
Wait a minute.

957
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,640
Did you put it in? Yes, I did.

958
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920


959
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,180
Did you put it in? Yes, I did.

960
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,160
It's in my eye.

961
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,340
Does it feel good?
It's in my eye.

962
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Oh, no.

963
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,860


964
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,680
I think something is wrong.

965
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I think it's crushed.

966
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
I'll do it for you.

967
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,160
It's too tight.

968
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,380
It's too tight, so it's crushed.

969
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,700
It's not crushed.

970
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,180
It's not crushed.

971
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,880
Do you have any
questions? Put it on her.

972
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,020


973
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,920
Which one do you like, Suiko?

974
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,820
Which one do you like more?

975
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,420
Which one do you like more?

976
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:40,421
Do you need a hand? Kiss her.

977
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,880


978
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Say, I did it!

979
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
I did it!

980
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,300
Do you want to be stronger?

981
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,980
I've been stronger since the beginning.

982
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,060
You've been stronger since
the beginning? Be nice to her.

983
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,060
I'm so happy.

984
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780


985
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,540
She is raising her hand over there.

986
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
It's me.

987
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,880
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

988
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,860


989
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,600
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

990
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800


991
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,180
She is kissing you.

992
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,660
Can I kiss you?

993
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,120
Do you want to kiss me?

994
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:37,880
This is the first time I've ever
seen a chimpanzee play with a baby.

995
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,126
I was surprised to see a
chimpanzee play with a baby.

996
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,420
This is the first time I've ever
seen a chimpanzee play with a baby.

997
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:46,141
This is the first time I've ever
seen a chimpanzee play with a baby.

998
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,760
You are so energetic.

999
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
You are so energetic.

1000
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,380
You are so energetic.

You are so energetic.

1004
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,441
You are so energetic.

1005
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
You are so energetic.

1006
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,620
You are so energetic.

1007
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
You are so energetic.

1008
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,600
You are so energetic.

1009
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
You are so energetic.

1010
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
You are so energetic.

1011
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
You are so energetic.

1012
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:35,100
This is the first time I've ever seen
a mother and a baby play together.

1013
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:41,350
I'm glad I was able to see it
for the first time in a long time.

1014
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,390
I'm glad I was able to see it
for the first time in a long time.

1015
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,570
Do you want to
put it in? It's erotic.

1016
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,430
It's erotic.

1017
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,090


1018
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,550
Do you want to put it in?

1019
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,400
You are being pushed out.

1020
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,380
Does it feel good?

1021
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,930
Does it feel good?

1022
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,940
Let's go to bed soon.

1023
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:16,021
Are you going to the beach?

1024
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,800
Did you have too much
fun at the beach? Yes, I did.

1025
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,920


1026
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,860
My dad is lonely.

1027
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
My dad is lonely.

1028
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,400
Chimpo! Chimpo!

1029
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,401
Chimpo train!

1030
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,260
Chimpo! Chimpo!

1031
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Chimpo train was late.

1032
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Chimpo!

1033
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:34,840
Chien!

1034
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Chien!

1035
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,380
How is Chimpo?

1036
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,400
How is Chimpo?

1037
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:41,960
How are you feeling?

1038
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,400
I was left-handed,
so I was a little sloppy.

1039
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Wow!

1040
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,760
I didn't think you were left-handed.

1041
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,680
It's the same, isn't it?

1042
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
I'm left-handed.

1043
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Let's go with Chiku.

1044
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Chiku!

1045
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
I might be Chiku-kawa.

1046
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,040
Chiku-kawa?

1047
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,000
What if I'm not Chiku-kawa?

1048
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,700
What if I'm not
Chiku-kawa? Here we go.

1049
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,600
One, two.

1050
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,600
Chiku-kawa.

1051
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
A little.

1052
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,380


1053
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,040
A little? A little brown.

1054
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,880


1055
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,840
A little Chiku-kawa.

1056
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,760
It's a beautiful circle.

1057
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,060
It's a beautiful circle.

1058
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
Chiku-kawa.

1059
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Chiku-kawa.

1060
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Chiku-kawa.

1061
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Chiku-kawa.

1062
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Chiku-kawa.

1063
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Chiku-kawa.

1064
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,320
Chiku-kawa is blue.

1065
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Chiku-kawa is blue.

1066
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Chiku-kawa is blue.

1067
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
Chiku-kawa.

1068
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,460
She is very surprised.

1069
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,000
Look at this.

1070
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,000
What?

1071
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
This is Nakayoshi.

1072
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,240
Look at him while he is attacking you.

1073
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Chikubai.

1074
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,540
Chikusubai.

1075
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,980
Oh, no.

1076
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
He is getting fat.

1077
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,530
How is your physical condition?

1078
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,591
Your hands are getting bigger.

1079
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:10,630
My hands are getting bigger?

1080
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:11,951
I'm doing push-ups with my chest.

1081
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,850
Your hands are getting bigger.

1082
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
It's getting bigger.

1083
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,230
Really? Look.

1084
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:20,690
It's true.

1085
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,130
Look.

1086
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:22,790
It hurts.

1087
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,870


1088
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,010
It's getting bigger.

1089
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,030
It's getting bigger.

1090
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,510
I can't do it from this side.

1091
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,030
It's here.

1092
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:31,570
Really? It's here.

1093
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,950


1094
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,310
It's in my pocket.

1095
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:36,431
Pocket-chan is in the video.

1096
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,910
Pocket-chan!

1097
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,410
Pocket-chan!

1098
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,630
She said Pocket-chan
It's a new series.

1099
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,470
Pocket-chan!

1100
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,690
Pocket-chan!

1101
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,630
What's wrong?

1102
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,470
Pocket-chan!

1103
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,730
Let me take a look at your neck.

1104
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,810
Let me take a look at your neck.

1105
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,510
I'll give you a treatment.

1106
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,511
He is sleeping.

1107
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,810
He is funny.

1108
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,510
Oh, no!

1109
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,910
He is getting bigger.

1110
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,110
Is he? I don't know.

1111
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,070


1112
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,030
He is getting bigger.

1113
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,870
He is hard.

1114
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:22,810
Hard? He is hard.

1115
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,270
He is playing.

1116
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,370


1117
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,770
I'm curious about the future.

1118
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,890
I want to see it.

1119
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,770
Do you want to see it?

1120
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,150
I want to see it.

1121
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,370
Don't you want to see it yet?

1122
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,930
Mr. Ozashi?

1123
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,330
What?

1124
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,330
How is it?

1125
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,710
It smells like sweat.

1126
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,890
Really?

1127
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,970
It smells like sweat.

1128
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:53,970
It smells like sweat.

1129
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,250
You can't see it from now on.

1130
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,670
I can see it.

1131
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:00,930
I can see it.

1132
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,790
Don't peep into other people's house.

1133
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,430
Don't peep into other people's house.

1134
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,630
Thief! Thief!

1135
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,100
How are you? I'm fine.

1136
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,900


1137
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,020
Tama, how are you?

1138
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
So soft! So soft.

1139
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,580
Feels good.

1140
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500


1141
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
I want to touch you.

1142
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,030
Wow, it's so beautiful!

1143
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,400
It's so beautiful!

1144
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
It looks like a house.

1145
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,970
It's a chimney.

1146
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,340
It's red.

1147
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
It's so beautiful.

1148
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,160
It's beautiful.

1149
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,760
Is this your original
hair? Yes, it is.

1150
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
I see.

1151
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880


1152
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,600
Can I touch your
cheek? Yes, you can.

1153
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,940
Touch her nipples.

1154
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,680
Touch her nipples.

1155
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,060
Touch her nipples.

1156
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,120
This is not good.

1157
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,540
I'm nervous.

1158
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,580
It's going to break.

1159
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,140
It's going to break.

1160
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,540
It's so beautiful.

1161
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,240
Tama is amazing.

1162
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Tama baby.

1163
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,580
I'm watching you.

1164
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,240
Tama baby.

1165
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,120
Amazing.

1166
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,360
It's so soft.

1167
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
It feels good.

1168
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,460
It's like playing with a ball.

1169
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,280
It's so soft and feels good.

1170
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
The ball feels so good.

1171
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,780
Play with it properly.

1172
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,080
Show me what you are good at.

1173
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,140
I'm not good at it yet.

1174
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:46,860
Not yet?

1175
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,980
Not yet? You are strict.

1176
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,220


1177
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:49,620
Not yet?

1178
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,740
I need to improve myself.

1179
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:57,360
I'm going to eat it.

1180
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,140
Let's eat it.

1181
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,760
It's hard.

1182
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,780
Really? It's delicious.

1183
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
It's pasta.

1184
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Itadakimasu.

1185
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,121
Can I eat it?

1186
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
Can I eat it?

1187
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,000
Itadakimasu

1188
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,940
Ah!

1189
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,390
It fell

1190
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,600
Itadakimasu It's good

1191
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,280
It's good?

1192
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:44,300
It's good

1193
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
Pink

1194
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,581
Pink It's your turn to
stand out It's Pink's turn

1195
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,251
Pink is the most conspicuous color.

1196
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:58,530
This is pink.

1197
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,640
Double Shun.

1198
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,760
It's not triple.

1199
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,260
Now it's pink's turn.

1200
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,530
Pink.

1201
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:21,710
The sound of pink is a little.

1202
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,830
Erika-chan will be a double feather, and
the three of us will be a triple feather.

1203
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,250
I'm sweating.

1204
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,610
I'm sorry.

1205
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,250
It's prepared.

1206
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,030
This side.

1207
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,470
What are you
pinching? I lick it, too.

1208
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,310
It's delicious.

1209
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,771
Is it good?

1210
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,121
Then, I'll put it on your nipple.

1211
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,710
Your nipple.

1212
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,450
Do you want to taste it? Sorry.

1213
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:56,050


1214
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:57,690
Do you want to taste it?

1215
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,150
Yes.

1216
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,470
It's good that you two lick it.

1217
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,190
It's good.

1218
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,530
It's good.

1219
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,330
It's sweet.

1220
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,450
I'll lick your tongue.

1221
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,170
It feels good, right?

1222
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,130
I want to lick your mouth, too.

1223
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,050
Let's do it together.

1224
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,105
What should I do?

1225
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,110
Where are you going?

1226
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,670
Does it feel good?
Wait a minute.

1227
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,050
It's easy to lick.

1228
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,670
This is easy to lick.

1229
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,350
Does it feel good? It's soft.

1230
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:13,970
I can't get in.

1231
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:23,410
It's delicious.

1232
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,490


1233
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,890
How about this?

1234
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,590
I'll taste it first.

1235
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,590
It's scary.

1236
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:53,850
It's a good day.

1237
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,210
It's a bad day.

1238
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,350
It's a very good day.

1239
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,390
It's great.

1240
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,990
It feels good.

1241
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,150
Shall we put it in?

1242
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,710
Yes, let's put it in.

1243
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,910
Let's put it in.

1244
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,370
Let's put it in from the J.

1245
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,290
I want to pee.

1246
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,590
Pee? I want to pee.

1247
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:21,370


1248
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,470
Can I put it in first?

1249
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,470
Why?

1250
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,690
Why?

1251
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:27,990
Why?

1252
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,510
Why?

1253
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,370
Why?

1254
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:39,930
Why?

1255
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:43,670
Why?

1256
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:43,850
Why?

1257
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:44,270
Why?

1258
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,271
Why?

1259
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,350
Why?

1260
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:48,690
Why?

1261
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,170
Why?

1262
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:50,810
Why?

1263
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:51,050
Why?

1264
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,430
Why?

1265
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:52,990
Why?

1266
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:54,166
Are you sure? I'm going to do it.

1267
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:54,650
I'm watching you.

1268
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,030
Oh, no.

1269
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,050
Let's go over there.

1270
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:00,130
Why?

1271
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,490
I'm watching you.

1272
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:02,170
Why?

1273
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:03,070
I'm watching you.

1274
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,130
I'm going to do it.

1275
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,670
Oh, no.

1276
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:06,671
I did it.

1277
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,430
Don't make me laugh.

1278
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:13,210
You did it.

1279
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:14,211
I was patient.

1280
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,730
You were patient,
weren't you? Yes, I was.

1281
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,711
What did you say? I was patient.

1282
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,210


1283
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:28,990
You'll see it soon.

1284
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:31,590
You're holding it.

1285
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,450
I'll show you.

1286
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:33,750
You'll see it soon.

1287
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:34,630
You're holding it.

1288
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:35,631
Pretty face.

1289
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:36,950
It's almost over.

1290
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,270
Wait.

1291
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,770
You'll see it soon.

1292
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,530
You'll see it soon.

1293
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:48,330
You'll see it soon.

1294
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,190
I hate it because everyone is watching.

1295
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,770
Everyone says they love it.

1296
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,450
Maybe they are a little.

1297
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,290
They say it won't come out.

1298
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,770
Won't it?

1299
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,090
They say it won't come out.

1300
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,610
But everyone said it a lot.

1301
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,090
But I'm going to wipe it.

1302
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,850
It's the same when you wipe it.

1303
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,870
It's the same when you wipe it.

1304
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,730
It's the same when you wipe it.

1305
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,091
It's the same when you put it out.

1306
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,470
It's the same when you wipe it.

1307
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:17,250
If you don't come
back, it's going to start.

1308
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:18,830
I'm going to put it on.

1309
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:22,910
I'm going to put it on.

1310
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,410
I'm going to put it on.

1311
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,570
I'm going to put it on.

1312
00:53:25,571 --> 00:53:25,970
I'm going to put it on.

1313
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,370
I'm going to put it on.

1314
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:26,410
I'm going to put it on.

1315
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:26,530
I'm going to put it on.

1316
00:53:26,531 --> 00:53:26,910
I'm going to put it on.

1317
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,650
I'm going to put it on.

1318
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:43,050
I'm going to put it on.

1319
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,070
Here you go.

1320
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
What kind of penis
is it? Baki-baki.

1321
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:49,590


1322
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:50,510
Baki-baki? Baki-baki.

1323
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,660
Baki-chin.

1324
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,830
Baki-chin.

1325
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,450
Baki-chin.

1326
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,010


1327
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,450
Baki-chin is great.

1328
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,190
Great, great.

1329
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,330
Does it feel good?

1330
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:02,850
Yes.

1331
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,230
Does it feel good? Great.

1332
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:03,890


1333
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,970
There's a lot in there.

1334
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,050
There's a lot in there.

1335
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:09,290
There's a lot in there.

1336
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:10,630
Great.

1337
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,530
There's a lot in there.

1338
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:13,010
I feel so good.

1339
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:14,590
Can you do something for me?

1340
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,030
Can you do something
for me? I feel so good.

1341
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:18,010
I feel so good.

1342
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:24,010
I feel so good.

1343
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,710
If you can't move, you can move.

1344
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,110
I feel so good.

1345
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:32,330
I can't move my hands.

1346
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,450
Please sit down.

1347
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,430
Please sit down.

1348
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,490
I can't move my hands.

1349
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,070
I can't move my hands.

1350
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:53,090
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

1351
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,250


1352
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,270
Oh my god! It's so erotic.

1353
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,410


1354
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,590
It feels so good.

1355
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,530
It's really erotic.

1356
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,880
I'm so happy.

1357
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,240
You are happy, aren't you?

1358
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:23,100
You are happy, aren't you?

1359
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:23,440
You are happy, aren't you?

1360
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:24,441
I'm going to go.

1361
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,530
Are you going to go?

1362
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,840
Are you going to go?

1363
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,100
I'm going to go.

1364
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
I'm going to go.

1365
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,060
Wow!

1366
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,920
Really, Mara?

1367
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,660
Mara, are you OK?

1368
00:55:38,661 --> 00:55:39,781
I want to put it in quickly.

1369
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,040
I want to put it in quickly.

1370
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,060
Do you want to put it in quickly?

1371
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,310
Decide in the next turn.

1372
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,780
Do you want to put it in
the next turn? I'm wearing it.

1373
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:49,781


1374
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,400
Which one do you want to wear?

1375
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,620
Which one do you want to wear?

1376
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,980
Which one do you want to wear?

1377
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,500
I'm going to wear it.

1378
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,540
OK.

1379
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Oh, it feels good.

1380
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,696
Which one do you want to put in?

1381
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
I want to put it in.

1382
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,120
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1383
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:06,960
I want to put it in.

1384
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,260
I want to put it in.

1385
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:10,180
If you lick the one that
feels good, you put it in?

1386
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,440
If you make the nipple
feel good, you put it in first?

1387
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

1388
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,680
Oh, it feels good.

1389
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,560
I'm sorry.

1390
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,300
I'm sorry.

1391
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:40,600
You are so violent.

1392
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
Do I smell violently?

1393
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:45,400
You are so violent when you smell.

1394
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,700
I feel so good.

1395
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,300
I'm going to go.

1396
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,540
She is so violent.

1397
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,340
I feel so good.

1398
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,320
I can't choose.

1399
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,400
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1400
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1401
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,420
Rock-paper-scissors, go!

1402
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,160
I'll play rock-paper-scissors with Elio.

1403
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
What should we play?

1404
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,620
What should we play?

1405
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,200
What should we play?

1406
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,620
Let's play Iimara.

1407
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,780
Iimara? What should
we play? Iimara.

1408
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,580
Do you like back?

1409
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:29,660
Do you like back? Yes, I do.

1410
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:30,840


1411
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,720
Let me see your butt.

1412
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,420
Let's wait.

1413
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,600
Here you are.

1414
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,960
We are waiting.

1415
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
Here you are.

1416
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,180
Here you are.

1417
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
Here you are.

1418
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,040
Here you are.

1419
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,320
Here you are.

1420
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,460
Here you are.

1421
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,700
Here you are.

1422
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,280
I have to look for it.

1423
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,200
This is a good Mara.

1424
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,940
It's a good Mara, isn't it?

1425
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,820
Mara is the best.

1426
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,720
Mara is cute.

1427
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,880
She is cute and soft.

1428
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,200
She is so cute.

1429
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,740
She is so cute.

1430
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,380
She is so cute.

1431
00:58:13,381 --> 00:58:14,381
I can't say weird things.

1432
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,780
I can't say weird things
because I'm so cute.

1433
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,940
She is a good Mara.

1434
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,830
Don't move!

1435
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,150
You are moving too fast!

1436
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,710
You are moving too fast.

1437
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,710
Don't move!

1438
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,510
Let's do normal back!

1439
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,550
Let's do normal back.

1440
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,330
If you can see, I can't.

1441
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:54,810
I'm glad to hear that.

1442
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:56,190
Are you happy?

1443
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:58,490
You look like you feel good.

1444
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:06,710
You look like you feel good.

1445
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,380
Ahhhh!

1446
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:10,800
Ahhhh!

1447
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,230
Ahhhh!

1448
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,080
She's going to pop it up.

1449
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,720
Ha ha ha ha!

1450
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,480
I'm gonna help you.

1451
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,560
No, no, no!

1452
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,200
No, no, no!

1453
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,200
No, no, no!

1454
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
No, no, no! I'll help you.

1455
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,160
Ha ha ha ha!

1456
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,820
No, no, no!

1457
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,400
No, no, no!

1458
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,840
They are playing with each other.

1459
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,161
They are playing with each other.

1460
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,620
They are playing with each other.

1461
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,640
They are playing with each other.

1462
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,980
Let's face the mirror.

1463
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,640
Oh, you're right.

1464
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,380
What?

1465
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
What are you doing?

1466
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,300
Oh, it's Eno-chan!

1467
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,340
It's Eno-chan!

1468
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,200
It's Eno-chan!

1469
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,320
It's Eno-chan!

1470
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,580
Do you want to show your armpit?

1471
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,120
Show me your armpit.

1472
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,320
Show me your armpit.

1473
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,500
You're sweating a lot.

1474
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,540
Show me your armpit.

1475
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,120
Show me your armpit.

1476
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:36,340
Oki-check! Oki-check!

1477
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,540
It's so beautiful!

1478
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,600
I'm beautiful, too.

1479
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,310
Too beautiful?

1480
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,360
You're so beautiful.

1481
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:43,456
You're drawing a super-bending.

1482
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,480
Too beautiful!

1483
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,180
Too beautiful! I'm gonna go.

1484
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:48,930


1485
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,280
No! No! I love Oki.

1486
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:51,540
I love Oki.

1487
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,960
I love Oki.

1488
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,100


1489
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,320
Cute!

1490
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,100
Cute! I'm sorry.

1491
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:00,101
Don't worry.

1492
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,301
I'm going to sleep.

1493
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,000
You are going to sleep?

1494
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:10,900
It's nice to fall asleep.

1495
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,560
I'm going to sleep.

1496
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,280
It's nice.

1497
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,740
Wow! Great! I can see it.

1498
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,460


1499
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
Great!

1500
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:39,920
She is touching me.

1501
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,540
She is asking me to touch her.

1502
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,180
Oh, it feels good!

1503
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:53,180
Oh, it feels good!

1504
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,580
Go away! It's you.

1505
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:17,581


1506
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,960
Because Chien-Po is
concentrating on Man-Po.

1507
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
5th?

1508
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,200
5th?

1509
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:28,620
5th?

1510
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:28,640
What?

1511
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,860
5th?

1512
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:30,760
5th?

1513
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
What?

1514
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:33,920
What should I say?

1515
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,140
What should I say?

1516
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:35,560
Man-Guri?

1517
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,020
Man-Guri?

1518
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,180
Why do you say that?

1519
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,440
Can I have a tissue?

1520
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,120
I'll check the tissue.

1521
01:02:44,121 --> 01:02:45,160
Tissue check.

1522
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,280
I wiped it.

1523
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,840
It's OK.

1524
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,620
It's good.

1525
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,320
Sleep here.

1526
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,160
Sleep?

1527
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,700
I'll do my best.

1528
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,460
From behind.

1529
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,020
She wants to do it herself.

1530
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,800
I'm going.

1531
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:07,760
Slowly.

1532
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,120
Give it to me.

1533
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,260
I don't want it.

1534
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,880
Look, look, look.

1535
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:15,420
I don't want it.

1536
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,560
Look, look.

1537
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,060
Does it feel good?

1538
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,180
Yes, it feels good.

1539
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,280
It's in your nose.

1540
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,120
It's a good smell, isn't it?

1541
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,420
It's a good smell.

1542
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:24,711
It's a good smell, isn't it?

1543
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:25,620
Does it feel good?

1544
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,120
Yes, it feels good.

1545
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,740
Wow, I can see your butt.

1546
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,820
Don't look at my butt.

1547
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:36,821
Don't look at my butt.

1548
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,080
Put it in slowly.

1549
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,620
Don't look at my butt.

1550
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,200
Put it in, put it in.

1551
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,220
Oh, no.

1552
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,140
It's in there.

1553
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,620
It feels so good.

1554
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,440
Does it feel good?

1555
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:48,260
It feels so good.

1556
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,320
Can you see it? I can't see it.

1557
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,640
I can't see it.

1558
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,920


1559
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,020
Are you embarrassed?
I can see it.

1560
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,480


1561
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,920
Can you see it?

1562
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,500
It feels so good.

1563
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,700
Oh, no.

1564
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,780
Oh, no.

1565
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,180
It's getting better.

1566
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,180
It's getting better.

1567
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:04,181
She is a bit shy.

1568
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,240
She likes butt.

1569
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,460
Let's put her on the top.

1570
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,380
She is on the top.

1571
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,160
Let's put her on the top.

1572
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
Oh, no.

1573
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,900
Oh, no.

1574
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:20,901
She is itchy.

1575
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,280
Oh, it feels good.

1576
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,680
Oh, no.

1577
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,020
She is too itchy.

1578
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,900
Oh, no.

1579
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,680
Oh, no.

1580
01:04:29,681 --> 01:04:30,681
You feel good, don't you?

1581
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,000
You feel good, don't you?

1582
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,320
You are getting bigger.

1583
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,820
You are getting bigger.

1584
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,520
You feel good, don't you?

1585
01:04:58,330 --> 01:04:59,390
Let's go, let's go.

1586
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:00,610
You too, Nocchi.

1587
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,050
You feel good, don't
you? You are scary.

1588
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:05,510


1589
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:06,910
Eri-chan, do you want to go?

1590
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,130
Eri-chan wants to go.

1591
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,410
I feel good.

1592
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,850
I feel good.

1593
01:05:14,851 --> 01:05:15,851
My butt is soft.

1594
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,470
I feel good.

1595
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,470
I feel good.

1596
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,630
I feel good.

1597
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:27,690
I feel good.

1598
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:27,930
I feel good.

1599
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,830
I'll show you my favorite toilet.

1600
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,410
I like it.

1601
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,250
My favorite toilet.

1602
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:35,510
I'll pee.

1603
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:39,030
He's already here.

1604
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:39,530
He's here! Let's see him.

1605
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:41,630
Here he is!

1606
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:42,870
Hello!

1607
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,830
He's finally here.

1608
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:50,530
Hello!

1609
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:51,850
Hi!

1610
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,570
Welcome!

1611
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,850
He's in the paddock.

1612
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:59,950
Hi!

1613
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:01,490
Hi!

1614
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:21,530
What are you doing? Look at me.

1615
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,480


1616
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,980
You don't like it,
do you? Look at me.

1617
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:43,981


1618
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:56,240
You are touching my butt again.

1619
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,460
You are touching my butt.

1620
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:29,530
I'm sorry for the noise.

1621
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:30,090
I was in a hurry to go to the bathroom.

1622
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,370
I'm sorry for the noise.

1623
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,010
I'm sorry for the noise.

1624
01:07:34,011 --> 01:07:35,011
Sorry.

1625
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,950
We'll go back to the bed.

1626
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:44,170
Be careful not to fall off.

1627
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:48,330
Please come back to the bed.

1628
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,230
Does he look like us?

1629
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:54,535
They do look like us.

1630
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,190
Then, let's go back to the bed.

1631
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,290
Hey, Genki.

1632
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,010
He is a good perch.

1633
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:04,011
This is Ichin.

1634
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:05,970
She is so cute.

1635
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,190
Wow!

1636
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,310
Wow!

1637
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:13,311
This is Marimiyamani.

1638
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:15,870
Wow!

1639
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,090
Wow! She is so cute.

1640
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:19,910
She is so cute.

1641
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,070


1642
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:23,930
This part is so cute.

1643
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,830
She has a heart.

1644
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:27,950
She is looking at me.

1645
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:31,030
You can't keep your fingers!

1646
01:08:31,031 --> 01:08:32,031
You are flitting, right?

1647
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,470
You are being mean!

1648
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,490
Do your best!

1649
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,890
No, you are too much!

1650
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,170
Do your best!

1651
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,750
No way!

1652
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:53,990
I can't keep my fingers!

1653
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,370
Urkan is playing.

1654
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,650
You can't do it.

1655
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,310
Don't look at the camera.

1656
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,590
Rangyu, look at me.

1657
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,970
It's impossible Do you?

1658
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:18,091
I want to see your reaction.

1659
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:20,170
It's too sour.

1660
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:21,870
It's impossible.

1661
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,090
I say, oh!

1662
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,190
You feel good, right?

1663
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,230
Do you feel good?

1664
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,250
You feel good?

1665
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:31,350
You are sleepy, right?

1666
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,470
You are sleepy, right?

1667
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,170
You are sleepy, right?

1668
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,410
Show me your armpit.

1669
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,850
Take a photo of me.

1670
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,310
Show me your armpit.

1671
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,770
It is beautiful.

1672
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,110
It is beautiful?

1673
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,690
You feel good, right?

1674
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:47,510
You feel good?

1675
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,290
You feel good? Don't touch me.

1676
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:33,010


1677
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,670
I will do it again.

1678
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,130
Oh no.

1679
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,150
He is very aggressive.

1680
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,630
He is in the baby's belly.

1681
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,210
Does it feel good? He will die.

1682
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,290


1683
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:57,010
Komaru is in a bad mood.

1684
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:58,070
Komaru is in a bad mood.

1685
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:00,090
Does it feel good?

1686
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:00,630
Let's go back home.

1687
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,230
He will die.

1688
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,430
How was it, Komaru chan?

1689
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,250
It was a good progress.

1690
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,470
It was the best.

1691
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,750
It was cute.

1692
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:16,470
I'm here.

1693
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,070
I'll take a break.

1694
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:20,710
I'll take a break.

1695
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:22,330
Are you going to take a break?

1696
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,730
I'll take a break.

1697
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,510
Are you going to die? It's hot.

1698
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,450


1699
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:32,990
I'll take a break.

1700
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:33,991
It's so gross.

1701
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:35,770
Isn't it terrible? Look at this.

1702
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:37,910


1703
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,370
Look through the mirror.

1704
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,510
It's so gross.

1705
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,350
Let's post it on Twitter.

1706
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,370
Let's post it on Twitter.

1707
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:53,890

01:12:09,941 --> 01:12:09,980
Let's post it on Twitter.

1710
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,080
Let's post it on Twitter.

1711
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,440
No, I don't.

1712
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,920
Yucchi!

1713
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,960
Why are you on my back?

1714
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:21,820
Why?

1715
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,960
You are a good girl.

1716
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,760
You are a good girl.

1717
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,580
You are a good girl.

1718
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,540
Yucchi!

1719
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,580
Yucchi! She is leaving.

1720
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,940
She is leaving.

1721
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,441
I'm so glad!

1722
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,020
She is leaving soon.

1723
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,300
Let's touch her nipples.

1724
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Let's touch her nipples.

1725
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,460
Let's touch her nipples.

1726
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,000
I can't move.

1727
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,440
I can't move.

1728
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:52,580
I'm sleepy.

1729
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,220
I'm sleepy.

1730
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,800
Let's do our best.

1731
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,940
Let's do our best.

1732
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,860
Her nipples are very straight.

1733
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,120
They are very straight.

1734
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,620
Are they straight?

1735
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,340
I'm going to move.

1736
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,820
I'm going to move.

1737
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,440
I'm going to move.

1738
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,440
I'm going to move.

1739
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,380
I'm going to move.

1740
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:26,340
I'm going to move.

1741
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,420
I'm going to move.

1742
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:35,051
Everybody, look at each other's face.

1743
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,140
Look at the face of Elion.

1744
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:49,720
Look at the face of Elion.

1745
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,000
Look at the face of Elion.

1746
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,560
Look at this side too.

1747
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:55,940
Cute, isn't it?

1748
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,020
It's like a pet.

1749
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:00,021
What kind of cat are you?

1750
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,020
You're Chiku Kawaii.

1751
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,380
You're Chiku Kawaii.

1752
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:10,160
You're Chiku Kawaii.

1753
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,180
You're Chiku Kawaii.

1754
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:13,100
You're Chiku Kawaii.

1755
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,920
You're Chiku Kawaii.

1756
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,180
Blue and pink.

1757
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,400
Only two of them.

1758
01:14:21,401 --> 01:14:23,880
I'm so sorry.

1759
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,120
Do you want to be petted?

1760
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,600
Do you want to
be petted? It hurts.

1761
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,380
Stop it.

1762
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,140
She left.

1763
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,960
She is so cute.

1764
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,760
She is so cute.

1765
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,400


1766
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,000
Shin-chan is not allowed to touch the butt.

1767
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,610
Touch his body by touching his buttocks.

1768
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,720
A butt.

1769
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,600
Touch his butt and check his
face by touching his buttocks.

1770
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,140
Touch his breasts and check his face.

1771
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,560
Oh, he was touched.

1772
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,720
Say ah.

1773
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,180
Oh, my, why? I'm sorry.

1774
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,680
I'm sorry.

1775
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:35,850


1776
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:47,270
How do you feel? I feel good.

1777
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:48,870
You are cute.

1778
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:50,310
I feel good.

1779
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,310
I feel good.

1780
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:52,530
I feel good.

1781
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:54,110
You are cute.

1782
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:56,910
You are cute.

1783
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:01,090
I feel good.

1784
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:01,810
I feel good.

1785
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:06,310
I have to thank Kanji.

1786
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,311
I have to thank Kanji.

1787
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,010
Thank you, Kanji.

1788
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,131
Kanji, aren't you resting too much?

1789
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:13,390
Kanji, hurry up.

1790
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,750
Kanji, put it on.

1791
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,510
Kanji, let's do our best.

1792
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:20,710
Kanji, aren't you resting too much?

1793
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:23,150
Kanji, let's do our best.

1794
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:25,670
Kanji, let's put it on.

1795
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:26,930
Oh, it doesn't fit.

1796
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,330
Kanji, let's put it on.

1797
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,070
Kanji, Kanji.

1798
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,190
Does it fit?

1799
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:45,090
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

1800
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:45,350
I'm glad I was able to see it.

1801
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,190
I'm glad I was able to see it.

1802
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:49,110
I'm glad I was able to see it.

1803
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:51,650
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

1804
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:52,450
Touch it.

1805
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:53,451


1806
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,230
It feels good,
doesn't it? Touch it.

1807
01:16:55,231 --> 01:16:57,130
It feels good, doesn't
it? It feels good.

1808
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:03,810
It feels good.

1809
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:09,440
I'm so excited.

1810
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,500
It feels good.

1811
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,140
I want to see it.

1812
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,200
Do you want to see it?

1813
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,320
Can you see it from
here? I can see it.

1814
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,180


1815
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Wow! It's so cute.

1816
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,760
It's so cute.

1817
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:20,580
Here you are.

1818
01:17:20,581 --> 01:17:22,020
I love you, Sei-chan.

1819
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,780
I love you, Ichi.

1820
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,100
Ero.

1821
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,700
Ero.

1822
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,300

01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:31,620
More.

1827
01:17:31,621 --> 01:17:32,621
More.

1828
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,880
More.

01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,720
More.

1831
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,320
More.

1832
01:17:41,321 --> 01:17:42,321
You feel good, don't you?

1833
01:17:43,760 --> 01:18:00,980
You feel good, don't you?

1834
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,960
You are the best!

1835
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:14,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1836
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,720
Look at Kanji's face.

1837
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,080
Look at Kanji's face.

1838
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,560
What are you going to do?

1839
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,600
She started with a straight face
and ended with a straight face.

1840
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,000
Wow, it's gone.

1841
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,620
It's gone.

1842
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,200
It feels good.

1843
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,360
It feels good, doesn't
it? It feels good.

1844
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:35,500


1845
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,920
It feels good, doesn't
it? I feel so good.

1846
01:18:40,921 --> 01:18:41,921
I feel so good.

1847
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,860


1848
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,500
Oh, there is a pony.

1849
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,060
Oh, no!

1850
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:08,080
Stop it!

1851
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,460
Don't stop it!

1852
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,440
Don't stop it!

1853
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Don't stop it!

1854
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
Don't stop it!

1855
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,300
Don't stop it! Don't eat it.

1856
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:18,301
Don't eat it.

1857
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,800
Don't eat it.

1858
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,440
Don't eat it.

1859
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:24,760
It feels good.

1860
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:27,300
It feels good.

1861
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,160
It's close.

1862
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,260
It's close.

1863
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,760
It feels good.

1864
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,360
It's close.

1865
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:51,040
It's close.

1866
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:57,980


1867
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,420
It feels so good.

1868
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,480
Aty, you are sweating.

1869
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,900
Am I?

1870
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,240
I'm sweating all the time.

1871
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,540
You look like you are holding it in.

1872
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,360
Can I go now?

1873
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,240
What? Where are you going?

1874
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,440
Where do you want
me to go? Just like this.

1875
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,100
No, no, no.

1876
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,880
What do you mean? No way.

1877
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:23,420
I told you.

1878
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,880
No way.

1879
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,280
Thank you.

1880
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,480


1881
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,160
You are not the first one.

1882
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,320
I'm not the first one.

1883
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,220
I'm not the first one.

1884
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,660
Go! Go!

1885
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,260
Go! Go!

1886
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:47,880
Why did you do that?

1887
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,840
You are so nervous.

1888
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,740
Because I won the championship.

1889
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:53,741
I got it!

1890
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:55,900
Did you really get it?

1891
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,640
Did you really get it?

1892
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,360
Are you sure?

1893
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,640
Here we go!

1894
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,360
Wow! It's out!

1895
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:04,640
Wow!

1896
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,420
Are you sure?

1897
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,440
Are you sure?

1898
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,580
It's out!

1899
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,080
It's warm!

1900
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,860
It's out!

1901
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,120
Did you really get it?

1902
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,700
Let me take the responsibility.

1903
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,780
J, take the responsibility.

1904
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,340
Do you want to taste it?

1905
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,200
J, you have to take the responsibility.

1906
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,050
Stand in a line.

1907
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,700
I'm going to kiss you while licking you.

1908
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,340
Look at the camera.

1909
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,080
If I touch you a little,
you'll get up right away.

1910
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,740
You got up again, didn't you?

1911
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,210
Oh, no! Let's lick it.

1912
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,500


1913
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,170
Kiss!

1914
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:27,350
So cute!

1915
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,780
Everyone is kissing.

1916
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,960
It's warm.

1917
01:22:47,705 --> 01:22:48,705
Can I lick your hair?

1918
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,900
Let's lick your chin.

1919
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,220
I'll go first.

1920
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,180
Here you are.

1921
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:56,780
Here you are.

1922
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,920
Did you get permission? Oh, no.

1923
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,280


1924
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:13,950
It's getting worse.

1925
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,560
It's getting worse.

1926
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,761
I think you can put it in your mouth.

1927
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,180
Can you put it in your mouth?

1928
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,180
Can you put it in your mouth?

1929
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,080
Yes.

1930
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:25,020
I'll put it in.

1931
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:26,960
I'm going to put it in the bag.

1932
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:27,961
It's a choice.

1933
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,021
I'm going to put it in the bag.

1934
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,600
I don't want to.

1935
01:23:32,601 --> 01:23:33,601
I don't want to.

1936
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,260
It's not fair.

1937
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,140
It's not fair.

1938
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,080
Did you put it in the bag?

1939
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,580
Yes.

1940
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,980
Did you put it in the bag?

1941
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,080
Yes.

1942
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,120
You are so cute.

1943
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,060
You are so cute.

1944
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,940
Look at the face.

1945
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:55,941
So cute.

1946
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:04,580
Let me see.

1947
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,580
I want to see your face.

1948
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,580
I want to see your face through the mirror.

1949
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,280
Ero.

1950
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,340
Ero.

1951
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,460
Very Ero.

1952
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,560
It's time to go to bed.

1953
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:21,561
Let's go to bed.

1954
01:24:25,745 --> 01:24:27,680
Why are you so energetic?

1955
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:29,920
There were three of us.

1956
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,360
Don't you think it's too early?

1957
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,220
Do you feel good?

1958
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:38,780
Yes, I feel so good.

1959
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:40,740
Don't move.

1960
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,680
I'll put you in the room.

1961
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:43,620
No! No, you can't.

1962
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,120


1963
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,320
If you do that, I'll want to take it out.

1964
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,160
No, you can't.

1965
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:50,691
Do you want to take it out?

1966
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,380
But I feel good today.

1967
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:54,840
Oh, no.

1968
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:56,440
You can't.

1969
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,800
Oh, no.

1970
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:00,700
Do you feel good?

1971
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,420
Do you feel good? Oh, no.

1972
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,100


1973
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,640
Do you feel good?

1974
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,600
I can't stand it.

1975
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,560
I can't stand it.

1976
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:11,980
You can do it.

1977
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,480
Wait a minute.

1978
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:18,520
You did it.

1979
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,320
You did it.

1980
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,400
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

1981
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,940
You did it.

1982
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,140


1983
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:30,260
She wants you to lick her nipples.

1984
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,040
She wants you to lick her nipples.

1985
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:40,940
She wants you to lick her nipples.

1986
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,940
She likes her nipples.

1987
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,340
I can feel my nipples.

1988
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,840
It feels good.

1989
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,500
It's so hard.

1990
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,800
Is it hard? It's so hard.

1991
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,340
I'm sorry.

1992
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:19,820
I'm sorry.

1993
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,860
I'm sorry.

1994
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,670


1995
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:36,010
What's your favorite?
My favorite is.

1996
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,730
..

1997
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:41,090
I like bag.

1998
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:42,870
Bag? I like bag.

1999
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,920


2000
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:45,290
Show me your bag.

2001
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,290
Let me see.

2002
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,410
Kawamanko.

2003
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,630
Come here.

2004
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,770
You are so cute, Maruko.

2005
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:10,630
You are the most naughty one.

2006
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:11,930
You are so naughty.

2007
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,370
Are you shy?

2008
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:20,470
You are running away from me.

2009
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:22,450
No, you are not.

2010
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,250
Yes, you are.

2011
01:27:24,251 --> 01:27:25,690
I'm going to give you a massage.

2012
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:34,490
Does it feel good?

2013
01:27:38,135 --> 01:27:39,970
Your legs are moving.

2014
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:52,040
I'm going to give you a massage.

2015
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:56,280
You are moving a lot.

2016
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:01,400
Close your legs.

2017
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:08,400
You are moving a lot.

2018
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,900
You are moving a lot.

2019
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,820
I can't stand it anymore.

2020
01:28:24,821 --> 01:28:25,821
You are going too far.

2021
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:32,620
I can't stand it anymore.

2022
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:39,040
I can't stand it anymore.

2023
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:39,200
I can't stand it anymore.

2024
01:28:39,201 --> 01:28:40,201
I can't stand it anymore.

2025
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:40,800
I can't stand it anymore.

2026
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,060
I can't stand it anymore.

2027
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,960
I can't stand it anymore.

2028
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,400
I can't stand it anymore.

2029
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:50,200
I can't stand it anymore.

2030
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,080
I can't stand it anymore.

2031
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,020
I can't stand it anymore.

2032
01:28:52,021 --> 01:28:53,021
It's so good.

2033
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:54,340
It's so good.

2034
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,960
It's so good.

2035
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:57,280
It's so good.

2036
01:28:57,281 --> 01:28:57,900
It's so good.

2037
01:28:57,901 --> 01:28:58,340
It's so good.

2038
01:28:58,341 --> 01:28:59,120
It's so good.

2039
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,220
It's so good.

2040
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:00,420
It's so good.

2041
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:01,580

01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:52,660
Be careful.

2214
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:53,340
Be careful.

2215
01:35:53,341 --> 01:35:53,440
Be careful.

2216
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Be careful.

2217
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:00,380
You don't have
to wash your face.

2218
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:02,056
You don't have to wash your face.

2219
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,800
Do you want me to wash your face with salt?

2220
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,796
Do you want me to wash your face with salt?

2221
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:08,916
Let's wash your face with salt.

2222
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:11,180
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2223
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:13,580
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2224
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,180
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2225
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,080
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2226
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,000
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2227
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,340
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2228
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,640
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2229
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,340
You don't have to wash your face with salt.

2230
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:36,240
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2231
01:36:36,241 --> 01:36:39,200
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2232
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,620
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2233
01:36:40,621 --> 01:36:40,700
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2234
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,480
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2235
01:36:42,481 --> 01:36:42,580
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2236
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:43,980
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2237
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,040
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2238
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,260
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2239
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,000
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2240
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,500
Mom, I'm washing my face.

2241
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:53,840
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

2242
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:55,161
You're a fan, so you can't do it.

2243
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:56,580
I can do it.

2244
01:36:56,581 --> 01:36:58,320
I can do it.

2245
01:36:58,321 --> 01:36:59,660
I can do it.

2246
01:36:59,661 --> 01:37:04,160
I can do it.

2247
01:37:04,161 --> 01:37:05,500
Let's take off the towel.

2248
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,280
Let's take off the towel.

2249
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,400
I'm hungry.

2250
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,900
I'm hungry.

2251
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,220
You're hungry.

2252
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,800
You're hungry.

2253
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:20,500
You're hungry.

2254
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,880
I want to go to the bathroom, too!

2255
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:23,881
I'll turn it on.

2256
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,180
First, my nipples.

2257
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:28,320
Nipples.

2258
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:30,140
Why?

2259
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:31,370
I'm going to pee.

2260
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,080
I'm going to pee.

2261
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,160
I'm going to wash my body.

2262
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:39,570
OK, I'll wash my nipples.

2263
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:43,140
I'm going to pee.

2264
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:51,120
She is very active.

2265
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:52,720
She is very active.

2266
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:06,500
She is getting bigger and bigger.

2267
01:38:06,501 --> 01:38:07,501
Are you getting taller?

2268
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:11,220
You've grown up.

2269
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,180
You've become easier to wash.

2270
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,480
You've become easier to wash.

2271
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,340
You've become easier to wash.

2272
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,340
You've become easier to wash.

2273
01:38:18,341 --> 01:38:18,420
You've become easier to wash.

2274
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,740
You've become easier to wash.

2275
01:38:19,741 --> 01:38:20,920
You've become easier to wash.

2276
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,240
You've become easier to wash.

2277
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:36,460
You've become easier to wash.

2278
01:38:36,461 --> 01:38:37,920
I'm the last one.

2279
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,040
I'm the last one.

2280
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:42,900
I'm the last one.

2281
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,780
I'm the last one.

2282
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,860
I'm the last one.

2283
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,100
I'm the last one.

2284
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:48,240
I'm the last one.

2285
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,020
I'm the last one.

2286
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,120
I'm the last one.

2287
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,920
I'm the last one.

2288
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,760
I'm the last one.

2289
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:59,000
I'm the last one.

2290
01:38:59,001 --> 01:39:00,001
I'm the last one.

2291
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:06,240
I'm the last one.

2292
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:07,280
It's difficult.

2293
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:08,480
It's difficult.

2294
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:09,900
It's difficult.

2295
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:12,660
It's difficult.

2296
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:13,680
It's difficult.

2297
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:14,500
It's difficult.

2298
01:39:14,501 --> 01:39:14,600
It's difficult.

2299
01:39:14,601 --> 01:39:15,840
It's difficult.

2300
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:16,980
It's difficult.

2301
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,280
It's difficult.

2302
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:18,680
It's difficult.

2303
01:39:18,681 --> 01:39:18,720
It's difficult.

2304
01:39:18,721 --> 01:39:19,721
It's difficult.

2305
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,320
It's difficult.

2306
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:28,060
It's difficult.

2307
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,080
It's difficult.

2308
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:32,320
It's difficult.

2309
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:35,860
It's difficult.

2310
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,080
It's not good.

2311
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:38,870
It's not good.

2312
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,080
My gums.

2313
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,380
It's not good.

2314
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's strange.

2315
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:49,060
Oh, my stomach hurts.

2316
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,460
I feel nauseous.

2317
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:52,860
It's not good.

2318
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,840
My stomach hurts.

2319
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,440
It's a bad day.

2320
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,496
※This is the first time
to see such a scene.

2321
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,600
Oh my god!

2322
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,100
Oh my god!

2323
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:08,200
※This is the first time
to see such a scene.

2324
01:40:08,201 --> 01:40:09,961
※This is the first time
to see such a scene.

2325
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:13,260
Oh my god!

2326
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,200
Wow!

2327
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,180
Oh my god!

2328
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,280
Oh my god!

2329
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,460
Oh my god!

2330
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,800
Oh my god!

2331
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:27,380
Oh my god!

2332
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:34,640
The three of us were really excited.

2333
01:40:34,641 --> 01:40:36,060
We were so excited.

2334
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,960
The three of us were really excited.

2335
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,640
The three of us were really excited.

2336
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,960
We were really excited.

2337
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,380
There was a lot of sacrifice.

2338
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,100
I couldn't move.

2339
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:51,040
I couldn't move.

2340
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:53,040
Like this? Yes, yes.

2341
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,480
I'm going to wash you.

2342
01:40:57,481 --> 01:41:00,840
Look at me.

2343
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,180
Don't mess around.

2344
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,140
I'm going to wash you.

2345
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,000
I'm going to wash you.

2346
01:41:09,001 --> 01:41:10,580
Does it feel good?

2347
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,760
Does it feel good?
The other side.

2348
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,480
The other side.

2349
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,260
The other side.

2350
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:22,580
I'm going to push you.

2351
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:32,218
This is the first time I've
ever seen a mother and her

2352
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:35,520
daughter playing with a
baby, so I'm a little nervous.

2353
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:44,535
I'm a little nervous
because I've never seen a

2354
01:41:44,547 --> 01:41:52,560
mother and her daughter
playing with a baby before.

2355
01:41:52,561 --> 01:41:54,280
Everyone should wash the dishes.

2356
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,560
You should wash the dishes.

2357
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,740
That's right.

2358
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,480
It's on Thursday.

2359
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:07,760
Wash the dishes...

2360
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,420
You have to wash the dishes.

2361
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,580
That's right.

2362
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,640
What are you
playing with? A coin.

2363
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:21,840
I want you to do it again.

2364
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,760
What?

2365
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:25,380
I want you to do it in a sexy way.

2366
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,060
Do you want me to do it in a sexy way?

2367
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:28,860
Yes.

2368
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,580
What are you going to do?

2369
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,400
Do you want me to lick you?

2370
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:34,420
Do you want me to lick you?

2371
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:35,660
Do you want me to lick you?

2372
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:44,460
Are you done?

2373
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,720
Yes.

2374
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,400
You are fast.

2375
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,500
By the way, I think I got
a good pat on the back.

2376
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:58,740
That's true.

2377
01:42:59,060 --> 01:42:59,640
I got a good pat on the back.

2378
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,060
That's true.

2379
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,520
That's true.

2380
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,900
I want you to get a good pat on the back.

2381
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,060
A good pat on the back?

2382
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:07,660
Let's move on to the next one.

2383
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,220
Let's move on to the next one.

2384
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,640
Let's move on to the next one.

2385
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,560
I'm going to get a good pat on the back.

2386
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,340
I see.

2387
01:43:13,341 --> 01:43:14,341
Let me see your hand.

2388
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,600
You are amazing.

2389
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:17,940
Oh!

2390
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,300
It's getting too tight.

2391
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,360
It's getting too tight.

2392
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:24,420
Your hand is getting too tight.

2393
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,840
How about this?

2394
01:43:26,841 --> 01:43:27,920
Please touch my hand.

2395
01:43:27,921 --> 01:43:28,921
Oh!

2396
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,060
You are so naughty.

2397
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,460
You are so naughty.

2398
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:34,160
You are so naughty.

2399
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,520
You are so naughty.

2400
01:43:35,521 --> 01:43:35,780
You are so naughty.

2401
01:43:35,781 --> 01:43:41,580
You are so naughty.

2402
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,920
Chikkun, let's go.

2403
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,200
Do you feel good? Very good.

2404
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:54,920


2405
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:04,160
Ero.

2406
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,700
Very good.

2407
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,680
You are so cute.

2408
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,880
Your eyes are dirty.

2409
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,500
Your eyes are dirty.

2410
01:44:18,855 --> 01:44:23,180
Do you want to be licked?

2411
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:26,580
Do you want to be licked?

2412
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,420
Do you want to be licked
by Jay? Jay licks you.

2413
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,100


2414
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:36,700
Yes.

2415
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,680
Don't look at me like that.

2416
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,140
You are licking your lips.

2417
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,820
You have to put more.

2418
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,300
More? More.

2419
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:52,320
Good girl.

2420
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,720


2421
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,440
I can't put it all.

2422
01:44:58,910 --> 01:44:59,910
You can't?

2423
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,140
You can say it louder.

2424
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,560
Louder? Say it louder.

2425
01:45:40,561 --> 01:45:41,561


2426
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:43,410
How is it? It feels good.

2427
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,500


2428
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:47,060
It's really hard.

2429
01:45:57,345 --> 01:45:59,440
It's really hard.

2430
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:00,280
It's really hard.

2431
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,900
It's really hard.

2432
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,640
It looks good.

2433
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,020
Can I eat it? Let's do it.

2434
01:46:05,021 --> 01:46:06,021


2435
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:12,900
It's coming out a lot.

2436
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,800
It's scary.

2437
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:16,020
Wow.

2438
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:19,430
Wow.

2439
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:24,560
It's scary.

2440
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:27,860
Wow.

2441
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:32,220
It's scary.

2442
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:40,840
It's a lot.

2443
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,280
It's a lot.

2444
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,580
I'm sorry.

2445
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,320
I was a little scared.

2446
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,060
I'll bear with it.

2447
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,900
It's a lot.

2448
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,140
It's amazing.

2449
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,900
It's a lot.

2450
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:00,760
It's a lot.

2451
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:01,560
It's a lot.

2452
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:02,780
It's hard to do as a child.

2453
01:47:02,781 --> 01:47:03,180
It's hard to do as a child.

2454
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:03,520
It's hard to see.

2455
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,960
Yes, it is.

2456
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:06,961
Wow!

2457
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:11,320
You put out a lot.

2458
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,320
Yes, I did.

2459
01:47:13,321 --> 01:47:14,321
You are a warrior.

2460
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,820
Yes, I am.

2461
01:47:20,705 --> 01:47:21,705
Oh, I made a mistake.

2462
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:23,920
Yay!
