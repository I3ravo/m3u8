1
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:18,715
Please be careful.

2
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,670
Oh, thank you.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's great.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,540
It's fun.

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,420
Everyone, please take a break here.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,340
After that, please go to the inn.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,940
Excuse me.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,300
Can I make a phone call?

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Yes.

10
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,610
Oh, hello.

11
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,611
Hello? It's you?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,800
I just got to the inn
and I'm taking a break.

13
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,130
I'll be there soon.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,090
Oh, you're taking a break?

15
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,290
Are you okay?

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,370
Are you sick? I'm fine.

17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,030


18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,090
My boss and the employees are all married.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,250
I'm serious.

20
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,251
That's it.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,600
Call me again when you arrive at the inn.

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,190
OK. I'll call you again.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,250
See you.

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,430
Husband? It's hard.

25
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,480


26
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,220
And you look like a newlywed.

27
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,900
I made a promise.

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,720
If I accept the employee's
request, I will call you.

29
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,130
I'm 6 years married.

30
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,380
I'm a very worried person.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
You are boring.

32
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,680
Do you have a child?

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Yes.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
I see.

35
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,940
Well, during this trip, be free
from your husband and have fun.

36
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,640
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,960
I have been working as a
full-time employee since last month.

38
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:59,825
It's a small advertising
agency for men, but it's an

39
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:04,900
at-home company that supports
me who is inexperienced.

40
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,374
It's hard to keep my
worried husband, but I

41
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:12,740
found out that I wanted
to build a new couple.

42
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,701
I would like to build up
the shape of the future.

43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,660
Yes, that's right.

44
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm relieved that the
diagnosis came out properly.

45
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,700
What? Divorce? Wait a minute.

46
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,070


47
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:34,716
I don't think about divorce.

48
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,071
Because I can't have children.

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,000
His heart disease is a disease.

50
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,340
I know you don't like
it, but it can't be helped.

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,660
Instead, I'm going to start working.

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,200
As a full-time employee.

53
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,460
It was hard to convince you.

54
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,560
But you managed to convince
me, and now you're supporting me.

55
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,460
There's nothing we can do about it.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,900
Even if we don't have kids,
we can still be a married couple.

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,640
So you don't have to worry about it.

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
See you later.

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,140
Thank you.

60
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:39,770
Thank you for your hard work.

61
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:40,771
Good morning.

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,570
Please take a bath.

63
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,150
We will have a party from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.

64
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,590
Please don't be late.

65
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,930
Ms. Natsume.

66
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,610
The party room will be
our large guest room.

67
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,390
Thank you.

68
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,850
I'll see you at 6 p.m.

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,570
Thank you.

70
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,571
Please.

71
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,090
I'll give you the key.

72
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,570
Here you are.

73
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,130
Hello, Senpai.

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
Here you are.

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Thank you.

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Hello, Senpai.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
Hello.

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Hello?

79
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,571
I just arrived at the hotel.

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
It's calm.

81
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
It looks like this.

82
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,060
Can you see it?

83
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,430
I'm going to take a
bath, so I'm going to go to

84
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,840
the dinner party after
I finish taking a bath.

85
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,711
What? Do I have to eat dinner with you?

86
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,100
You can refuse, can't you?

87
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,900
Hurry up and eat.

88
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,901
Wash the ice cream
and go back to your room.

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,820
And don't drink alcohol.

90
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,680
I took a bath and feel refreshed.

91
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,220
The bath here was the best.

93
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I agree.

94
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,340
And the food was delicious.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,161
By the way, where is Natsume?

96
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Why did you love her?

97
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,720
Well, to put it simply, you're my type.

98
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,960
I thought so.

99
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,740
You're married and inexperienced,
so you don't have a strategy.

100
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,781
You're right. You're a little sexy.

101
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:22,940
This job interview may be a chance to
shorten the distance between you and her.

102
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,920
You're really sexy.

103
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Really?

104
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,381
You said you couldn't get
enough of Natsume's eroticism.

105
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,800
I know, but...

106
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,980
I've gotten tired of going
to the Happening Bar lately.

107
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,240
Isn't it more fun to
sleep over? Excuse me.

108
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,540


109
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,700
Thank you for waiting.

110
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,600
Oh, Natsume-san, sit here.

111
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,320
Look, it's on.

112
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,680
I'm not good at drinking.

113
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,760
No, no, it's okay. Just have
a drink with me, okay? Okay.

114
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Thank you.

115
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,200
Oh, thank you.

116
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300


117
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Thank you very much.

118
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,140
Let's have a toast while deepening
our relationship with Natsume-san.

119
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Cheers!

120
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,110
By the way, Natsume-san,
you're married, right?

121
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,910
Why did you decide to start working?

122
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:45,911
What do you think now?

123
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,110
I feel bored every day as a housewife.

124
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,670
But your husband is worried about you.

125
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,050
He must be worried when
he sees such a beautiful wife.

126
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,430
No, he isn't.

127
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,790
Let's forget about your
husband and have a drink.

128
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,270
Do you still have
alcohol? Oh, I'm sorry.

129
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,190
Then, drink it.

130
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,890


131
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,090
I heard that crab is delicious here.

132
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,850
You should go there.

133
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,650
Please go there.

134
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,650
Natsume-san, please eat a lot.

135
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,950
Thank you.

136
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,670
It looks delicious.

137
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:44,890
―Second part―

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,160
My sparring partner
gets tired, doesn't she?

139
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,020
If I were her,I wouldn't do it.

140
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:11,920
And she doesn't know it
even if she cheated just a little.

141
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,460
I'm just kidding.

142
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,020
Are you OK?

143
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,300
Well, let's have another drink
and then we'll say good-bye.

144
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,200
OK.

145
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,560
Thank you.

146
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:31,540
It was too late when I woke up
because my consciousness was far away.

147
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,480
It was already too late when I woke up.

148
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,200
My boss, who had changed his
appearance, covered me with a blanket.

149
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,680
It's nice to be alone.

150
00:14:34,600 --> 00:16:37,340
Is it beautiful? It smells good.

151
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,700


152
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Are you tired? Please stop.

153
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,601
Please let me go.

154
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Mitsune.

155
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Look.

156
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
This is a company trip.

157
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,820
There are also such happenings.

158
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,980
No.

159
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:05,981
Right?

160
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,620
It's a big deal.

161
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,600
Let's enjoy it.

162
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
No.

163
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,700
It's okay.

164
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:33,701
That's right.

165
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,060
Please stop.

166
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,430
You've been drinking too much.

167
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,350
You've lost your strength.

168
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,540
You're under a lot of stress
because of your husband, aren't you?

169
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,640
You need to relieve your stress.

170
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:51,820
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's so cute.

171
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm so happy.

172
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:10,070
I'm so happy.

173
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,500
There is a lot of hair.

174
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:13,590
There is a lot of hair.

175
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:28,750
There is a lot of hair.

176
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,370
What's wrong? You're wet here.

177
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,350
It was my dream to have
you do this since you came in.

178
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm glad you're here.

179
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,700
I want to hold you.

180
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
It's okay.

181
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,010
You're not here, so
let's have fun like this.

182
00:23:34,060 --> 00:24:21,330
I'm your boss, so you have to listen to me.

183
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,330
You are beautiful, Natsumi-san.

184
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,030
Natsumi-san, when did you
last have sex with your husband?

185
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm just going to rub you like this.

186
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,620
It's okay.

187
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,100
I'm just going to rub you.

188
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,120
You haven't done anything yet.

189
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,540
You haven't done anything yet.

190
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:06,110
Don't you want it? Please stop.

191
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,330
It's OK.

192
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,610


193
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Please be honest.

194
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,050
You want to put it in
your mouth, don't you?

195
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,930
I can't stand it anymore.

196
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,540
I finally got into your mouth, Natsume.

197
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,250
I'm going to move.

198
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:03,251
I'm sorry.

199
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:50,900
Natsume, you are connected to me.

200
00:29:41,210 --> 00:30:03,750
Can you see me, Natsume?

201
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,450
Natsumi, are you okay?

202
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,460
Which do you prefer,
your husband or Natsumi?

203
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,300
Which do you prefer,
your husband or Natsumi?

204
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,500
Natsumi, you are so sensitive.

205
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,000
It's easy for you to get angry.

206
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,640
It's good, isn't it?

207
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,490
I won't give up.

208
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,120
I won't give up.

209
00:32:50,995 --> 00:35:17,320
If you are so big and kind,

210
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,840
your subordinates will get up.

211
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:39,450
Natsume-san, let's have
fun on this business trip.

212
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,500
Natsume-san, your cell phone is ringing.

213
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:53,230
Hello? What are you doing? Are you okay?

214
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,220
I'll be back soon. I'll call you later.

215
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,520
What? Are you drinking? Are you okay?

216
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:08,521
What?

217
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
What?

218
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:26,270
Are you the husband of the patient?

219
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,830
Yes.

220
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
It must be hard for you.

221
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,070
Natsume-san, I'm so glad.

222
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,770
Asu... Moto...

223
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,141
Asu, really... I
want to do it again.

224
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:56,400
You didn't feel sick,
did you? Please stop.

225
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,480
Please stop.

226
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,280


227
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,590
You are a big girl now.

228
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,210
I'm sorry.

229
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,860
You're having fun, aren't you,
Natsume-san? Please stop it.

230
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
Stop it.

231
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,390


232
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,780
It's still messy here.

233
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm sorry.

234
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,400
It's going to work.

235
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:37,230
That's good, Hatsune.

236
00:42:44,830 --> 00:43:02,970
Do you still care about your husband?

237
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:23,000
Let's forget about Ayano and have fun.

238
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:19,180
Don't stand up.

239
00:44:24,790 --> 00:45:36,200
Mamedaifuku is in a bad mood today.

240
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,840
Be honest with yourself.

241
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,280
It's great.

242
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:38,910
It's tight.

243
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,590
I can't stand it anymore.

244
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,530
Yatsune-san, can I go again?

245
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:32,760
Natsume-san, you can do it
as many times as you want.

246
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,740
Do you want to do it one more time?

247
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,221
Do you want me to give you a massage?

248
00:52:45,390 --> 00:53:09,510
I'll give you a massage.

249
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,910
I'll start from the bottom.

250
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:16,111
I told you to go to bed early.

251
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,500
You forget your husband.

252
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,820
Hello?

253
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,440
Were you really sleeping?

254
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:38,700
Are you OK? I'm tired.

255
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:42,530
Really.

256
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,590
Hey, I can hear a man's voice.

257
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:47,690
Where are you?

258
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,861
I'm going to have breakfast.

259
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,150
Anyway, I'll hang up.

260
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:55,930
What?

261
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,800
It was a good thing.

262
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:07,580
Hey, uncle.

263
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,900
Hey, uncle.

264
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Let's have a drink.

265
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,880
No, no.

266
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,060
Uncle, please.

267
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,700
Sorry.

268
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:15,140
Cheers!

269
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,020
Natsume, you drink too.

270
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,860
It's not bad to drink in the daytime.

271
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,560
Let's toast.

272
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Cheers! It's delicious.

273
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,600


274
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,190
How was your trip? It was
fun, wasn't it? Yes, it was.

275
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,890


276
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,690
It was fun yesterday, wasn't it?

277
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:04,490
Right?

278
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:12,410
Let's have more fun in the future.

279
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:13,411
It's a shame.

280
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,380
You're like this again.

281
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,430
It's all your fault.

282
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,981
Can I ask you to do it
again? Let's have fun.

283
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,130
Again.

284
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,730


285
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,050
Are you serious?

286
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,610
Come on, sit down.

287
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,700
You still have a long way to go.

288
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,050
You're fine, aren't you?

289
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:14,740
If you're with Natsume,
you can do anything.

290
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:15,741
You can do it.

291
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,480
You have to be more open-minded.

292
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,930
Put your hand in your panties.

293
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,800
How do you feel?

294
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,560
How do you feel? It's hard.

295
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Don't worry.

296
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,370
I'm taking a bath.

297
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:38,940
Are you ready? Look at me.

298
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,050


299
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:55,290
You are still energetic, aren't you?

300
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,761
I'm not going to lose
to a young man like you.

301
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,550
As expected of Mr. Sabe.

302
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,710
Come on, touch it.

303
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:14,630
Mr. Natsume.

304
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,380
Mr. Natsume.

305
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:19,810
This was in it.

306
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,050
Don't be so embarrassed.

307
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:29,560
Come on, look at me.

308
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,680
You are so beautiful, Natsume-san.

309
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,110
Your husband is jealous of you.

310
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,430
Come closer to me.

311
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,561
Slowly put your tongue out.

312
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,010
Good girl.

313
01:05:33,350 --> 01:06:25,420
Please do not use your hands.

314
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:49,190
Please do not use your hands.

315
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:53,610
Which is bigger, your
husband's penis or my penis?

316
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:02,190
Please answer me.

317
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:14,880
Oh, I see.

318
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:20,760
Well, I'll ask you more.

319
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:31,100
You have to enjoy it.

320
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,620
It's a private trip.

321
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,800
Can I take a close-up of you?

322
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,800
Show me your face.

323
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,150
Peace, peace.

324
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,910
Natsume-san.

325
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
I'll never forget you.

326
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,900
Don't be so embarrassed.

327
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,440
Please.

328
01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:01,960
Please take a look, Mr. Omori.

329
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,480
Mr. Omori.

330
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,720
Please continue.

331
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,540
This is very soft, isn't it?

332
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,120
First of all, with your hands.

333
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,620
This is very soft, isn't it?

334
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:35,710
Mr. Omori, please let me lick your wings.

335
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:38,790
My chimpanzee.

336
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,170
Ohoho

337
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:59,740
Hatsune-san, it's time for you to lick me.

338
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,670
Ahahaha

339
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,380
That's right, that's right.
The back of the head.

340
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,840
You're good at it, aren't you, Hatsune-san?

341
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,240
I'd like you to lick me as it is.

342
01:10:44,565 --> 01:10:45,646
Please give me a high-five.

343
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,840
I'll suck your head.

344
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:13,530
I'll lick your head and go up.

345
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:15,530
Lick it up to the top.

346
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:37,900
Lick it up to the top.

347
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:57,690
Just with your mouth.

348
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,020
Ah! Look this way.

349
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,630
Good.

350
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,960
Peace.

351
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,440


352
01:13:15,155 --> 01:13:22,660
You are so nice, Natsume-san.

353
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,600
Let me play with you.

354
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,890
Faster.

355
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,590
Use your hands.

356
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,660
Look at me.

357
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,980
Squeeze it.

358
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,740
Wow~!

359
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:56,280
Oh, photos and photos.

360
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,220
Great.

361
01:14:58,495 --> 01:14:59,860
Look, Nagisa-san.

362
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,140
Look, Mutsuki-san.

363
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,500
See, you have to do it with a smile.

364
01:15:06,855 --> 01:15:09,660
Look, peace is being eaten away.

365
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,900
What the hell is he doing?

366
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,480
What is he doing? Thank you.

367
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,020


368
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,600
May I? I'm sorry.

369
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,400
Thank you.

370
01:15:58,970 --> 01:15:59,970
Cheers.

371
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:01,820


372
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:05,610
Wow.

373
01:16:06,835 --> 01:16:08,220
You're sweating a lot.

374
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:18,070
Katsume-san.

375
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:20,951
It's fun to travel with
employees, isn't it?

376
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,750
Yes.

377
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:26,710
It's nice to be able to do
a lot of pleasant things.

378
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,860
Can I take this off?

379
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,870
I'll take it off.

380
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,970
I'll take it off as a memory
of the employee trip.

381
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,940
Fingers, fingers.

382
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,670
It seems that he is in a good mood.

383
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,700
He is so erotic.

384
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,600
Natsume-san's fur feels really good.

385
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,680
I feel like I'm going to go there soon.

386
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:31,681
It's getting cold.

387
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,040
Hey, Natsume.

388
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,020
Hey, Shimizu.

389
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,400
Show me your body more.

390
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,370
I'm going to put my butt on your neck.

391
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,270
I'm going to sleep.

392
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,620
I'm going to sleep.

393
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:28,000
I feel so good.

394
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:40,060
I feel so good.

395
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,920
I feel so good.

396
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,960
I can't stop.

397
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:54,320
I can't stop.

398
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:56,360
You are doing great, Natsume-san.

399
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,480
Your buttocks are the best.

400
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:14,240
Look at your face.

401
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,160
Natsume-san,
here? Please tell me.

402
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:25,180


403
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,300
Where is it?

404
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:43,840
Please tell me where it is, Natsumi-san.

405
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:46,900
Where is it?

406
01:19:48,215 --> 01:19:49,440
Here?

407
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,260
The baby is crying.

408
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,020
The baby's nipples are hard from the bra.

409
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:26,910
Is it here?

410
01:20:27,210 --> 01:21:10,080
How many times did you go to the vet
this time, Natsume-san? I don't know.

411
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,260


412
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,240
Are you going to sleep?

413
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,940
You look sleepy.

414
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,380
What's the matter?

415
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:47,970
You look sleepy.

416
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:49,211
You are such a mischievous boy.

417
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:57,950
You are scratching your own back.

418
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:11,300
What's wrong?

419
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:14,600
Are you satisfied with this?

420
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,680
Do you want more?

421
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,460
You are scratching your own back.

422
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,350
I'm going to give you a massage.

423
01:22:43,351 --> 01:22:44,351
Your shoulders are stiff.

424
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,380
It's over.

425
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,180
Let me see your butt.

426
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:13,020
Let me see your butt.

427
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,240
Let me see your butt.

428
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:20,580
How do you feel?

429
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,030
Your butt looks round.

430
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:29,431
It's a good day, isn't it, my wife?

431
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,170
I'm taking a video of you, too.

432
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:35,170
Oh, you're in the video again.

433
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,410
It feels good.

434
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,220
I'm going to touch you.

435
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,390
I'm going to touch you.

436
01:23:43,535 --> 01:23:45,590
I'm going to touch you.

437
01:23:45,591 --> 01:23:46,591
Are you OK?

438
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:57,890
Where do you feel pain?

439
01:24:34,805 --> 01:24:43,580
Be careful, be careful.

440
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:51,680
I'm glad I adopted you.

441
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,960
Huh?

442
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:18,940
Let me see your mouth.

443
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:21,380
I'm going to give you a bath.

444
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:40,020
Wow, that's amazing.

445
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:02,860
You are so good.

446
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:09,520
I'm so happy to have such
a good father, Natsume-kun.

447
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,420
Natsume-san, you are my treasure.

448
01:27:12,421 --> 01:27:53,080
It's amazing, isn't it?

449
01:27:55,930 --> 01:28:00,820
The movement of the tongue is wonderful.

450
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,820
It's amazing, isn't it?

451
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,730
Mr. Hayatsume, please look at me.

452
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:43,670
You must be happy to
have such an experience.

453
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:47,790
Did it work well? Yes, it did.

454
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,330
It's wonderful.

455
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:15,390


456
01:29:19,465 --> 01:29:21,130
I'm counting on you, Tama.

457
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:36,680
It's wonderful.

458
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:51,540
You're doing great.

459
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,771
Let's throw it together this time.

460
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,140
You can throw it together,
but let's do it this way.

461
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:41,260
You've never had such
an experience, have you?

462
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:45,360
Your tongue is also...

463
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,700
You've never had such
an experience, have you?

464
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:14,391
I was worried that he would
get sick, but he was fine.

465
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:24,720
I thought he'd be fine if I did something,
but I thought he'd be fine if I didn't.

466
01:32:24,721 --> 01:32:26,596
I was so worried that I
didn't know what to do.

467
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,766
I'm going to give you a treat.

468
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:30,960
Do you want more?

469
01:33:39,190 --> 01:34:08,700
I'm going to give you a treat.

470
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:16,360
Do you feel good? It's so fun.

471
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:19,170


472
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,280
It's fun, isn't it? Look at me.

473
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,180
Don't push me.

474
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,400


475
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:36,020
Relax your legs.

476
01:34:36,021 --> 01:34:37,021
Relax your legs.

477
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:45,330
You are very sleepy.

478
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,240
You are very sleepy.

479
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:59,230
You feel good,
don't you? I'm sorry.

480
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:09,650


481
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,150
I can't let you go.

482
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:39,430
I feel good.

483
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,380
Come here.

484
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,720
I'm sorry.

485
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:34,010
I'm sorry.

486
01:38:34,011 --> 01:38:35,011
That's right.

487
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,030
That's right. Move, move.

488
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:46,950
That's right. Rub, rub.

489
01:39:11,365 --> 01:39:12,120
That's good.

490
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:13,121
Oh, my God.

491
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,280
Oh, my God.

492
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:15,700
Oh, my God.

493
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,620
Oh, my God.

494
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,540
Oh, my!

495
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,250
It's incredibly painful.

496
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,070
I've overdone it.

497
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:43,890
I'm strangled.

498
01:40:44,790 --> 01:41:32,150
Ah, my poor back.

499
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:33,570
My back is frizzing.

500
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,070
It won't hurt so soon.

501
01:41:35,071 --> 01:41:36,071
Oh, I see.

502
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:53,560
Can you see it?

503
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:01,030
Can you see it? I can't see it.

504
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:02,690


505
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,140
Mamedaifuku, your mouth is dry.

506
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:50,440
Mamedaifuku, you can
move your mouth as you like.

507
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:54,800
Your mouth is dry.

508
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:10,711
Are you happy to touch
your mouth and tongue?

509
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:38,850
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

510
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,250
The baby's crying is so cute.

511
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:41,630
The baby's crying is so cute.

512
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:43,530
The baby's crying is so cute.

513
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:45,711
The baby's crying is so cute.

514
01:45:46,410 --> 01:45:47,410
I'm sorry.

515
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,630
I'm sorry.

516
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:56,670
It's OK.

517
01:45:56,671 --> 01:46:02,670
It's OK.

518
01:46:37,775 --> 01:46:53,570
I'm glad I adopted you.

519
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:56,740
I'm going to take a look at your back.

520
01:49:04,985 --> 01:49:16,370
I can't see your back.

521
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:46,550
Oh, wow.

522
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:48,710
Let me see your back.

523
01:49:50,115 --> 01:50:03,080
Show me your face.

524
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:08,640
Good girl.

525
01:50:21,305 --> 01:50:22,305
Do you feel good?

526
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,540
You are about to fall asleep.

527
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,540
I want you to get out of the bed.

528
01:50:38,515 --> 01:50:40,156
Do you want me to get you out of the bed?

529
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:56,340
I'm open, I'm open, I'm open,
I'm open, I'm open, I'm open.

530
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:26,290
Natsume-san, you want more, don't you?

531
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,090
Oh, you've got a lot out.

532
01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:33,270
I'll give you back.

533
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:39,390
Natsume-san, you can put your arm on it.

534
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:42,550
I'm sorry.

535
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,590
You're covered in blood.

536
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,590
I wonder what your wife
will think when she sees this.

537
01:51:58,730 --> 01:51:59,730
Do you feel guilty?

538
01:52:01,955 --> 01:52:03,390
Then, do you want to stop?

539
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:07,210
Do you want to
continue? I'm sorry.

540
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:09,190
It's tight.

541
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,720


542
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:21,300
Natsume-san, please put
your elbow on my shoulder.

543
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,280
Look at your face.

544
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:30,420
Good.

545
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:34,380
Look, peace, peace.

546
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,480
Nice to see you all.

547
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,480
Nice to see you all.

548
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:54,390
Nice to see you.

549
01:55:40,275 --> 01:55:45,940
Mom, please go to the examination.
It's going well.

550
01:55:51,320 --> 01:56:03,320
And I'm really sorry for
making you worry about me.

551
01:56:03,321 --> 01:56:05,140
