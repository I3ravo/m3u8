1
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:42,870
Good morning, everyone.
Did you enjoy the sex at the inn yesterday?

2
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,390
Let's enjoy the wonderful sex that will
remain in our memories today as well.

3
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:59,750
Before that, we will have two
more actresses participate today.

4
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,950
I'm Sayuri Hayama from Yuuka Oshima.

5
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,520
Please introduce yourself
and tell us your enthusiasm.

6
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:14,980
I'm Yuuka Oshima.

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,240
I couldn't participate in the audition
yesterday, but I'll do my best today.

8
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
Thank you.

9
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,850
I'm Sayuri Hayama.

10
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,270
It's my first time to perform with
other actresses, so I'm very nervous.

11
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,450
But I'll do my best, so thank you.

12
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,560
Thank you for your enthusiasm, both of you.

13
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,330
You are in Team B, and Ms.
Oshima is in Team D.

14
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,980
I'm sure it will be even more
exciting with the two of you together.

15
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
That's right.

16
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,780
Let's make fun memories together today.

17
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Oh!

18
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,406
Now, there's a little
time until the next corner,

19
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:14,080
so I'd like to set up a
5-minute talk time here.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,801
It's good to talk in the team.

21
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,976
It's good to talk to an actress
you don't usually talk to.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,380
It's good to talk to actresses,
so let's deepen your bonds here.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah! Good morning.

24
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,620


25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm Shiraishi.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Nice to meet you, too.

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,360
You were pretty rough yesterday.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I was in a good mood.

30
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,260
I bought a lot of things.

31
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:46,000
It was so good that I can't speak anymore.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,580
How about today?

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,320
Let's take a rest.

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,620
Yes, I want to take a rest.

35
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,620
Yes, me too.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,980
It's fun to be a teacher, isn't it?

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
It's really fun.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Do you like it? Yes, I love it.

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,680


40
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Do you like it? Yes, I love it.

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,480


42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,460
Do you like to teach boys?

43
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:09,501
Do you like to live alone?

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
I like it a lot.

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,540
I love it.

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Do you?

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,520
I woke up in Madonna.

48
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
I see.

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,280
What are you going to do today?

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,660
I'm thinking of going
to a open-air bathhouse.

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,260
Open-air bathhouse?

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,660
I've never been there.

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,680
Me neither.

54
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,681
What is it?

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,660
What is it? Thank you.

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480


57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
What is it?

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,800
That's Aya-sama.

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
That's amazing.

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,880
That's a game.

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
What?

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,700
I've never heard of it.

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,080
I've never heard of it.

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
How do you do it?

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,380
How do you do it?

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,660
How do you do it?

67
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
How do you do it?

68
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Hey, who's the king?

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,260
Recently, there are many
young actors I don't know.

70
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,580
I want to teach them.

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
That's good.

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
Let's do it.

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,300
Cheers!

74
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,301
Cheers!

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,870
Let's have fun
today! Hey, wake up.

76
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,160


77
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,290
It's hot, isn't it?

78
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,150
Let's take this off.

79
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Your body is getting hot.

80
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,190
You are sweating.

81
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,330
What's wrong?

82
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,810
Are you excited? You are cute.

83
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,710


84
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,670
You are sweating a lot.

85
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,430
I'm going to give you a lot of love.

86
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,000
You have a cute neck, too.

87
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,980
How about here?

88
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,200
You're surprised.

89
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,960
You're so surprised.

90
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,360
Do you want me to
lick you? No, I don't.

91
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,210
Give me a hug.

92
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:19,225


93
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,840
It feels good,
doesn't it? No, I don't.

94
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,020
Is it hard over
there? It looks hard.

95
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,360


96
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,041
Do you want me to lick you?

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,400
But...

98
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
It's embarrassing.

99
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
You're shy.

100
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
It's not embarrassing.

101
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,220
I want to lick you, too.

102
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,620
Let's lick together.

103
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,621
I see.

104
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,770
You are very sensitive.

105
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,350
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

106
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:14,010


107
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:39,020
He is a typical adult male, but
he has a soft, gentle personality.

108
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:39,480
He has a soft and gentle personality.

109
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:40,601
He is a gentle and cute boy.

110
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,400
He has a soft and gentle personality.

111
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,900
He has a soft and gentle personality.

112
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,901
Are you tired?

113
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,060
You are excited because it's your homework.

114
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,360
Be more excited.

115
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,450
Be more excited.

116
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,190
You like big boobs, don't you?

117
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
How is it?

118
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,520
You like it, don't you?

119
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
More? It's okay.

120
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,420
You want to touch it, don't you?

121
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,440
You like it, don't you?

122
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,190
You can drink more.

123
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,190
Is it soft?

124
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,170
Do you want to see more?

125
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,390
There are so many.

126
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,070
Do you want to see everyone's boobs?

127
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,950
Do you want to see?

128
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,870
Oh, you like it.

129
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,510
This side is good, too.

130
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,530
Then I'll do it, too.

131
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,390
I'm going to touch your ears.

132
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,070
I'm going to touch your ears.

133
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,610
I want you to touch me directly.

134
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,290
I want you to touch me more.

135
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,050
I'm going to give you a massage
from the bottom of my hand.

136
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,046
I'm going to give you a massage
from the bottom of my hand.

137
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,990
I'm going to give you a massage
from the bottom of my hand.

138
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:52,390
I'm going to give you a massage
from the bottom of my hand.

139
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:55,236
I'm going to give you a massage
from the bottom of my hand.

140
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:05,430
I'm going to give you a massage
from the bottom of my hand.

141
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,890
You're sweating a lot,
but it's good, isn't it?

142
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,930
You're sweating a lot,
but it's good, isn't it?

143
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:36,410
I'll make you feel good with my breast.

144
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,610
Do you feel good?

145
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,170
Do you know I'm
touching you? Yes, I do.

146
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,030


147
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,950
I'm touching you a lot.

148
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,850
Yes, I do.

149
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,390
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

150
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,530


151
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,350
I can't help it.

152
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,610
You're so cute.

153
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,450
You're so cute.

154
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,270
I'll give you some medicine.

155
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,850
It's for your neck and neck.

156
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,990
I want to do it, too.

157
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,180
It feels good.

158
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,580
You're so cute.

159
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,581
It's tickling.

160
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,140
You feel it, don't you?

161
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,260
You feel it with your
whole body, don't you?

162
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,600
It's scary, isn't
it? It's scary.

163
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,280


164
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,360
This is the first time
I've ever seen a baby cry.

165
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,900
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

166
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,261
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

167
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

168
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:19,480
What are you going to do?

169
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,300
I'm going to tickle you a little more.

170
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,760
You look so happy.

171
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,440
I'm going to rub you.

172
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,960
With that nasty boob.

173
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,920
Let's rub together.

174
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Let's rub.

175
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

176
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:15,530
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

177
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,830
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

178
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:20,910
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

179
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:20,990
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

180
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:22,565
Can I look at you?

181
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,330
Yes.

182
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,510
Show me, show me.

183
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,530
I'll look at you with everyone.

184
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,710
I'm embarrassed.

185
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,150
I'll look at you with everyone.

186
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:33,151
Here we go.

187
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
One, two.

188
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,270
You're so pretty.

189
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,270
I'm scared.

190
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,110
Are you embarrassed? I'm sorry.

191
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,111


192
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,230
Why? Did you miss
me? You're so cute.

193
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,090
You're pouting.

194
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,010


195
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,770
Are you waiting for me?

196
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,070
I'll give you a lot of love.

197
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,690
You're amazing.

198
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,270
Today is a video from the morning
of the second day of the rescue.

199
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,270
I am going to show you how to do it.

200
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,750
First, open your eyes.

201
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,270
Close your eyes and open your mouth.

202
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,490
Do not open your mouth wide.

203
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,981
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
with such a cute expression on its face.

204
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,090
I'm going to lick your face.

205
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,010
How do you feel? It's too hot.

206
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,010


207
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:53,080
You should make it harder.

208
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,920
It's too hot.

209
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,440
It's too hot.

210
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,560
It's too hot.

211
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,680
Are you getting hot?

212
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,740
Do you know you're getting hot?

213
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,360
Do you want to see more?

214
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,020
Let me show you.

215
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Oh...

216
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,020
I'm all muddy.

217
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,820
Look, I'll spread the bread for you.

218
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,980
Come on, take your tongue out.

219
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,780
Oh, it's so good.

220
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
It's so good, isn't it?

221
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,550
My legs are shaking.

222
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,660
I'm going to cry.

223
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:37,661
I'm so happy.

224
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm so happy.

225
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,850
I'm so happy.

226
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,540
You're so good at it.

227
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,920
I want you to feel good.

228
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,980
You want me to stroke you, don't you?

229
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Are you ready?

230
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Are you sleepy?

231
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,620
Are you sleepy?

232
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm going to stroke you.

233
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,500
Smell me.

234
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,360
You like my smell, don't you?

235
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,900
You like my smell,
don't you? Good boy.

236
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,860


237
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:55,420
You like it, don't you?

238
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,420
It feels good,
doesn't it? Good boy.

239
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520


240
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,440
You know it's good,
don't you? It feels good.

241
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:07,865


242
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:24,636
This is the first time
I've ever seen a cat like

243
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:35,660
this, and I've never
seen a cat like this before.

244
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,981
I've never seen a cat like this before,
and I've never seen a cat like this before.

245
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:57,481
I love you so much, I love you so much

246
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:07,666
so much, I love you so much

247
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,690
love you so much, I love you so much

248
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
I love it.

249
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,780
You are good.

250
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,740
You are good.

251
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,080
You are very good.

252
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
It felt good.

253
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,220
You were surprised when I said it.

254
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:37,300
I'm sorry. I'm getting slimy, too.

255
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Lick me, too.

256
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,950
How did you lick
me? Lick me, too.

257
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:24,490
I'm glad to hear
that you like it.

258
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:27,570
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

259
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,610
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

260
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,150
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

261
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

262
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm going to move my head.

263
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,820
My back is going to move.

264
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm going to move my body.

265
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,900
It feels good.

266
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:05,500
Can I stay like this?

267
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,020
Can I stay like this? I'm sorry.

268
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,980
Oh, no.

269
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Oh, no.

270
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:26,740


271
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,890
You're so delicious.

272
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,060
You're amazing.

273
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,860
You're so chubby.

274
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,440
You're a sassy little baby.

275
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
It's hot!

276
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,440
I'm going to pinch your
cheek with my cheeks.

277
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,440
Look at me.

278
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,840
I can't see it.

279
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,000
You have soft cheeks, don't you?

280
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,700
You like it, don't you?

281
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,380
You love it, don't you?

282
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,020
I'll rub it for you.

283
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Wow!

284
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,220
You're drooling.

285
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,320
You're drooling.

286
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,321
Give me a hug.

287
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,720
Give me a hug.

288
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:07,600
Give me a hug.

289
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,140
Give me a hug.

290
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:10,340
Give me a hug.

291
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,600
Give me a hug.

292
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:10,960
Give me a hug.

293
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:11,580
Give me a hug.

294
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:12,581
Give me a hug.

295
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,060
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's so cute.

296
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,020
I'm glad I was able to film it.

297
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,500
I'm glad I was able to film it.

298
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm glad to hear the sound
of the baby's heartbeat.

299
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm glad to hear the sound
of the baby's heartbeat.

300
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,736
I'm glad to hear the sound
of the baby's heartbeat.

301
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,540
I'm glad to hear the sound
of the baby's heartbeat.

302
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,640
I'm glad to hear the sound
of the baby's heartbeat.

303
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:30,800
This is the first time I've ever seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little worried.

304
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,810
I'm not sure if it's
because I've never seen

305
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:36,620
a cat like this before,
but it's amazing.

306
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm so happy just to play with you.

307
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I hope you feel better.

308
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
Hold my hand.

309
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,060
Thank you.

310
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,220
I'm sorry.

311
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,720
I'm glad you're doing well.

312
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,010
You're crying a lot.

313
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Thank you, Emi-san.

314
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,580
You're full of energy.

315
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,970
Maybe I should do something like this.

316
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,260
How is it? It feels good.

317
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
You're purring.

318
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940


319
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,800
You can't, right?

320
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,220
Not yet, right?

321
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,560
Not yet, right?

322
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,660
Not yet, right?

323
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:43,760
Not yet, right?

324
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:44,140
Not yet, right?

325
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:44,560
Not yet, right?

326
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:45,660
I'm not done yet.

327
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,610
More, right? I want more.

328
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,160
Next, Marina.

329
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,540


330
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,420
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

331
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm glad I was able to see it.

332
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,001
I'm glad I was able to see it.

333
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm glad I was able to see it.

334
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,161
Are you enjoying it?

335
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,620
Are you wrapped in a blanket?

336
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,040
You are so cute. I love you.

337
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,600
It's warm, isn't it?

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,800
You are so warm.

339
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,460
You are purring.

340
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,040
How do you feel?

341
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,100
You have a lot of teeth.

342
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
You have a lot of teeth.

343
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
You have a lot of teeth.

344
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760

349
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,600
We want to be more comfortable.

350
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,140
I want you.

351
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,760
I can't stand it anymore.

352
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,540
I want you. I want you.

353
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,300
If you want to take a
bath, can I do it for you?

354
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:09,840
It's hard, isn't it?

355
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,820
I'll take a bath first.

356
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,520
It's uncomfortable just to take a bath.

357
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,880
Oh, it's in.

358
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,840
It's in.

359
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,800
It's still in.

360
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,020
Oh, it feels good.

361
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,640
Oh, it's amazing.

362
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,440
Oh, thank you.

363
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Oh, thank you.

364
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,900
Oh, thank you.

365
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:48,901
Can you see it?

366
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:15,690
Momoka's mother

367
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:27,996

368
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,360

I can't move any more.

373
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,120
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

374
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,380
I'm so happy.

375
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,260
I'm so happy.

00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm sorry.

380
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,180
I'm sorry.

381
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:40,181
No, don't do that.

382
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,140
I'm sorry.

383
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,640
Show me.

384
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Please show me.

385
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
Let me see.

386
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,000
You are so fluffly.

387
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,280
Oh, you are fluffy.

388
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,080
You are so cute.

You are so cute.

390
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,340
You are so cool.

391
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,680
I can't do it anymore.

392
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:04,705
I can't do it anymore.

393
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
Let me lick your teeth.

394
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:40,960
I want you to catch me next time, too.

395
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,500
I want you to catch me.

396
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,201
I want you to catch me next time, too.

397
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,600
From the back?

398
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,340
I like it from the back.

399
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,341
I like it from the back.

400
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,960
Open your mouth.

401
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,280
I just pulled it out.

402
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,320
Wow, you're going in so deep.

403
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,840
Don't move.

404
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
I have to move.

405
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,140
Give her more attention.

406
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,840
Let her feel good.

407
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:44,841
I'm sorry.

408
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,550
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

412
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,340
I want you to love me more.

413
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
I'm sorry.

414
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,620
I'm sorry.

415
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,800
It feels so good!

416
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,780
Does it feel good?

417
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:42,420
It feels so good!

418
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,421
I'm going to get a cold.

419
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm going to get a cold.

420
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,780
I'm going to get a cold.

421
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:39,580
I'm getting a cold.

422
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm glad you're doing well.

423
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,241
You have a lot of hair.

424
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:22,280
I'm glad you're doing well.

425
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,660
I'm glad you're doing well.

426
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,150
I'm glad you're doing well.

427
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,130
It's good, isn't it?

428
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:37,131
It's good, isn't it?

429
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,060
Let's see your belly.

430
00:40:50,260 --> 00:41:17,320
It's amazing, isn't it?

431
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,560
What?

432
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,980
It's after you went to the
second floor, isn't it? It's amazing.

433
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:25,001
I can't believe it.

434
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,030
It's amazing.

435
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,540
It feels so good.

It feels so good.

440
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,170
It hurts, doesn't it?

441
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:03,330
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

442
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,360
No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,030
Oh, wow.

444
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,530
I love you.

00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,420
I love you.

446
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,130
Oh, wow.

447
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,050
You're so nice.

448
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,250
It really feels good.

449
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,730
It really feels good.

450
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,670
I'm going to make it more intense.

451
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,610
I'm going to make it more intense.

452
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,030

Don't cry.

458
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:13,610
I'm about to cry.

459
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,050
Don't cry.

460
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,690
Don't cry.

461
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,370
You'll feel better.

462
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,430
You'll feel much better.

463
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,130
Wow! I'm going.

464
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:34,680


465
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Together!

466
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:24,140
It's a video of me and my
husband's cat and our cat's voice.

467
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:26,226
And we also recorded a video of the cat's
voice that was recorded on a mobile phone.

468
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,460
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

469
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:28,461
How do you feel?

470
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Did you feel good? I'm glad.

471
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,240


472
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Let's do it again.

473
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,180
Please introduce yourself.

474
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300

479
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,480
You're not satisfied, are you?

480
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
Satisfied?

481
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,200
Yes.

482
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,440
I want to do more.

I see.

484
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,220
I'll think about it.

485
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:18,550
Excuse me.

486
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,530
I'm sorry.

487
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:23,910

Wow, it's amazing!

00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:41,891
Wow, it's salty!

498
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,350
Wow, it's salty!

522

You are happy, aren't you?

523
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,540
Let me lick your feet more.

524
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,980
You look so miserable.

525
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,220
Lick me more.

526
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
Lick me all.

527
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,350
Let me lick your feet.

528
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Wow!

529
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,900
You want to lick here, don't you?

530
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,060
Look at this!

531
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,440

00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:43,800
He looks so happy!

535
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,240
Look at this eyebrow! I'm sorry.

It's hot!

543
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:21,221
You have a scar on your neck.

544
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,760
What do you want me to do?

545
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,560
I want you to take a deep breath.

546

I'm hungry.

565
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,230
I'm hungry.

566
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,050
I'm hungry.

567
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,430
I'm hungry.

568
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,050
I'm hungry.

569
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,610
I'm hungry.

Are you happy to be bitten?

574
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:41,250
I feel tingling when you touch my feet.

575
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,090
Thank you very much.

576

I put out so much, but I put out so much.

580
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,370
I'm really a pervert.

581
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,490
I'm a little nervous.

582
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,030
Really?

583
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,390
I think it's going to come out.

584
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,610
I put it out.

I put it out.

590
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:16,630
I put it out.

591
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:17,670
I put it out.

592
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,370
I put it out.

593
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,730
I put it out.

594
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:18,910
I put it out.

595
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,310
I put it out.

596
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,570
I put it out.

597
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,450
Where are you going?

598
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:29,270
Where are you going?

599
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,670
Where are you going?

600
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:31,770
Where are you going?

601
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:32,830
Where are you going?

602
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,270
Where are you going?

603
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:36,470

Where are you going to put it out?

609
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:57,890
Where is hope?

610
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,711
I think it's okay to put
it out in your mouth.

611
00:52:04,365 --> 00:52:06,510
I think it's worth putting
it out in your mouth.

612
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:17,090
Oh, it feels good.

613
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,170
It was great.

614
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,610
Please let me out.

615
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,850
Please let me out more loudly.

616

Yuka, you can do it.

651
00:55:53,750 --> 00:56:01,034
This is the first time I've ever seen
a baby crying in front of me, and

652
00:56:01,046 --> 00:56:08,240
I've never seen a baby crying in
front of me, so I'm a little nervous.

653
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,605

me, but I'm so happy.

One more time?

663
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:20,981
I want to see how you do it.

664
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,350
I want to see it.

665
00:58:32,195 --> 00:58:38,650
I want to see it.

666
00:58:38,651 --> 00:59:05,760
Oh, my God.

667
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,540
Will it come out? Oh, my God.

668
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,280


669
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:26,050
I want to see it.

670
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:35,390
Oh, my God.

671
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,540
I was shivering.

672
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:55,950
I can't go out.

673
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:57,910
You can't go out.

674
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:02,930
You can't go out.

675
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:06,790
I can't go out.

676
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:22,270
I can't go out.

677
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,570
They are just starting to eat.

678
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:31,571
They are still eating.

679
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,190
They are still eating.

680
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:43,350
It's a perverted baby.

681
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,330
Ryo, what rank of Jinko is it?

682
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,750
It's A5 rank, Shimofuri Jinko.

683
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,390
A5 rank is delicious.

684
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,711
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

685
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,910
I'll put it in your mouth, too.

686
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,470
It's big.

687
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,530
Really? It's big.

688
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:29,730


689
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:30,490
Really?

690
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,030
Can I taste it?

691
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:33,450
Really?

692
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:34,930
Can I?

693
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,350
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

694
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,280
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

695
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,520
Do you feel good?

696
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,400
Does your neck feel good?

697
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:26,610
1. Try not to cry.

698
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,670
2. Crying.

699
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:33,350
3. Crying.

700
01:02:33,351 --> 01:03:09,840
4. Crying.

701
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:18,040
7. Crying.

702
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:24,710
8. Crying.

703
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,590
9. Crying.

704
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:27,770
Oh, my God!

705
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,210
It's gone again!

706
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,340
Again?

707
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,350
Wow!

708
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,830
You said that earlier.

709
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,730
I wonder if it's gone again.

710
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,141
How much is the perverted friend?

711
01:03:43,725 --> 01:03:44,790
Oh, my God!

712
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,070
It's gone again!

713
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,380
Oh, my God!

714
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, my God!

715
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,001
Oh, my God!

716
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:54,960
Oh, my God!

717
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:56,400
Oh, my God!

718
01:04:00,095 --> 01:04:01,160
It's still coming out.

719
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:03,380
It's still coming out.

720
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,280
Because we haven't put it in yet.

721
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,680
No, no, no.

722
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,800
We haven't even started yet.

723
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,360
Wait a minute.

724
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,480
Come here.

725
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,900
Come here.

726
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,280
No, no, no.

727
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,380
Wait a minute.

728
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,200
Come on.

729
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:30,840
You can still get out, right?

730
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,160
You can still get out, right?

731
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,501
You can still get out, right?

732
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,680
Hey, you got hit.

733
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
You poor thing.

734
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,280
Next is Nami-san.

735
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,660
Nami-san, make her feel better.

736
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,520
You can make her feel
better, right? I can't do it.

737
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,120


738
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,600
You can do it, right? I can't.

739
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,880


740
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
You can't? I can't.

741
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,140
I can't do it.

742
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,340


743
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,380
You said you can't do it.

744
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,040
You can do it.

745
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,340
You can do it, right?

746
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,940
You can do it, right?

747
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
You can still do it.

748
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,940
You can go up here.

749
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,940
You can go up here.

750
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,720
You can do it, right?

751
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,980
You said you can't do it.

752
01:05:22,981 --> 01:05:24,101
I'm not sure if I can do it.

753
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,840
You can do it.

754
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:28,040
Wow, you can do it!

755
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,520
You're doing great!

756
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:32,840
Wow!

757
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:34,040
Wow!

758
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,041
It's huge! It's OK.

759
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,780


760
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,180
He did it!

761
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,940
Wow!

762
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,700
Wow!

763
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,940
Wow!

764
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,146
There are not many people
around to take this situation

765
01:07:31,158 --> 01:07:31,440
seriously, but we can't
help but cry for them.

766
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,260
The children are just
waiting for their turn.

767
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:06,790
This is a video of a child
crying for her first time.

768
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,980
Show me!

769
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,860
Show me!

770
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,400
Wow, it's growing!

771
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,960
It's growing!

772
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,840
Wow!

773
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,020
Wow!

774
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,400
You all can't run away!

775
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,300
Wow!

776
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,400
Wow!

777
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:18,800
Ouch!

778
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:18,980
Ouch!

779
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:20,140
Wow, it's going to burst!

780
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,140
More! More!

781
01:09:29,260 --> 01:10:12,490
It's so natural here.

782
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,710
Lots of greenery,

783
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:17,750
and very pretty.

784
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:19,730
At a place like this,

785
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,930
a 20th anniversary event is being held.

786
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:31,010
I'm looking forward to it because
it's a very luxurious project.

787
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:42,350
There are more than 20 actresses, more
than 20 actors, and more than 100 staff.

788
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,370
I'm really looking forward to it.

789
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,730
Thank you for your hard work.

790
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:49,731
Good morning.

791
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,590
He is a staff member and an actor.

792
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,350
I'm Tato.

793
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,190
I'm doing my best.

794
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,730
He is a gorgeous staff member.

795
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,870
Wow, amazing.

796
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:06,810
It's amazing.

797
01:11:06,811 --> 01:11:17,570
The sign of the 20th anniversary of
the Onsen Bus Tour is shining brightly.

798
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,530
It's amazing, isn't it?

799
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,031
I think it's more than Moody's bus.

800
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,810
It's amazing.

801
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,351
It's even attached to the air conditioner.

802
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,310
It's gorgeous.

803
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,010
And look at this pond.

804
01:11:34,011 --> 01:11:35,011
It's moving.

805
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,051
I'm happy to be able to
stay in such a gorgeous inn.

806
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,687
I don't know when I'll
quit being an actor, but I'd

807
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:49,450
like to come to such a
gorgeous inn when I get married.

808
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,450
Wow, it's amazing.

809
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,470
It's beautiful.

810
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,410
The hydrangea is beautiful, too.

811
01:11:59,411 --> 01:12:03,010
Wow, is that where
you're turning the camera?

812
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,090
Oh, it's Samoari.

813
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,221
You've come on the second day.

814
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,050
Oh, my God.

815
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,250
I'm turning the camera firmly.

816
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:21,190
I think you'll turn a good camera today.

817
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:25,590
Director Dai, Mr. Mamezawa is not here.

818
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:34,030
Wow, this is amazing, this
corridor, this stone pavement, isn't it?

819
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:37,810
This inn has become a
demolition site, hasn't it?

820
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,790
Wow, it's so beautiful.

821
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,910
Oh, there's a samurai again.

822
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,050
Samurai are really after fishing.

823
01:12:48,051 --> 01:12:50,011
It's been a long time
since I've been to Samoari.

824
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,250
Huh? Oh, it's Mr.

825
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,590
Mamisawa! It's Mr.

826
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,050
Aizawa! I'm Mr.

827
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,190
Aizawa, the great director.

828
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,950
What are you shooting?

829
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:08,971
Mr. Samoari said he wanted
to do something sharp,

830
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:11,970
so he made me walk around the inn.

831
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,010
What do you think?

832
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:16,011
I think it's good.

833
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,270
Can I raise the gallery?

834
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,950
I don't think it's at that level yet.

835
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,511
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

836
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,110
I'm sorry.

837
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:26,650
Mr.Makai, did you hit your head recently?

838
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:27,850
I hit my head hard.

839
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:31,130
Mr.Makai, please do your best.

840
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:32,910
I'll do my best, too.

841
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,190
Good luck.

842
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,270
I'll do my best.

843
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,440
Oh, this is...

844
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:42,510
Isn't this the big
producer of this eye ball?

845
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:45,410
Hello, I'm the producer of
MADONNA, and I'm always in your care.

846
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,650
Wow, look at the hoodie.

847
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:51,010
The beginning of the
20th anniversary shoot!

848
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:53,930
Wow.

849
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:56,190
As expected.

850
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,490
I don't think we've ever
had a project like this before.

851
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,071
I don't think it's a good
idea to skip this project.

852
01:14:02,095 --> 01:14:03,110
I think it would be bad if I won.

853
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,170
No, no, no. Don't be mean.

854
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,871
By the way, how much is the budget?

855
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,341
Well, it's only a four-digit amount.

856
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,970
Oh, wow.

857
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,470
Thank you for inviting
me to a great project.

858
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,350
Thank you very much.

859
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,110
Please sell me more beer.

860
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:20,346
Thank you very much.
Let's do our best today.

861
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,810
Let's buy a mountain at the camp.

862
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,470
I'll buy a mountain.

863
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,570
Thank you very much.

864
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:29,870
I was so nervous I was nervous.

865
01:14:29,871 --> 01:14:30,950


866
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,310
But I'm still a newbie, so I'll do my best.

867
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:42,430
I'll do my best at the hot spring.

868
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,730
It feels good.

869
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,550
I've been wearing it for a long time.

870
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:03,690
I've never worn a ring like this before.

871
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,490
I think it's a good
idea to put a net on it.

872
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:11,390
I think so, too.

873
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,750
I want a real one.

874
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:14,790
I want to get married.

875
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,170
I want to get married.

876
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,050
I want to go home.

877
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,710
I want to get married.

878
01:15:24,711 --> 01:15:25,590
I want to get married.

879
01:15:25,591 --> 01:15:29,410
I don't like the word.

880
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,650
It's a bit erotic, isn't it?

881
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,590
The tempo is good, isn't it?

882
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,890
We're doing it,
aren't we? It's true.

883
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:39,491
We do it every time,
but... It's usually recorded.

884
01:15:40,365 --> 01:15:41,365
It's every time.

885
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:47,690
What did you do today?

886
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,960
What did you do? I don't know.

887
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,040
I like Hachule.

888
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,480


889
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,680
Hachule?

890
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,880
Hachule? It's a 9-key.

891
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,420
It's a 9-key.

892
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,581
Do you like it? Yes, I do.

893
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,340
Do you have a secret
today? No, I don't.

894
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,580
I know it, too.

895
01:16:08,581 --> 01:16:08,760


896
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:09,340
Do you? No, I don't.

897
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,960


898
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:12,591
Are you bullying
Shirofuku? No, I'm not.

899
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,740
I'm not.

900
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:14,000
This is it.

901
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,160


902
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,760
What's this?

903
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:18,520
Happy birthday? No, it's not.

904
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,420


905
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,680
It's a crocodile.

906
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,080
Crocodile?

907
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,800
I'm going to be a crocodile today.

908
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,320
I'll do my best.

909
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,320
Are you going to be a crocodile today?

910
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,280
I'm going to be a crocodile today.

911
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,200
I was given a role that doesn't make sense.

912
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,501
Today is our 20th anniversary.

913
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,860
Why is it called WANI?

914
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,060
There is a translation.

915
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,200
The man who comes to the
woman's world is called WANI.

916
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,280
But we are the opposite of that today.

917
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,480
It's different.

918
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,720
So the man should come in.

919
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:57,291
I've been waiting for this.

920
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,700
We just have to wait until he comes.

921
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:03,380
So, the moment you come
here, the crocodile will bite you.

922
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,280
Wow!

923
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,480
This is a prey town.

924
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,140
This is a prey town.

925
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,280
This is a prey town.

926
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:09,840
This is a prey town.

927
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,300
Yes, this is the hot spring.

928
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:13,940
Surprisingly,

929
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:22,800
it is said that there are legendary
crocodiles in the Tochigi hot spring.

930
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,680
What is a crocodile?

931
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:26,681
What is a crocodile?

932
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,380
Does a crocodile really
exist in a hot spring?

933
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,080
What?

934
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,100
I can hear the cry of a crocodile.

935
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,740
What?

936
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,080
What?

937
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,320
Is that a crocodile?
What? Oh, no.

938
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,440


939
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:50,420
Is this a crocodile that
lives in Tochigi Prefecture?

940
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:52,936
Is that a crocodile that says that
it will be a year-end celebration?

941
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,960
What?

942
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,140
What kind of 20th anniversary is this?

943
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,280
Is it okay to do such a ridiculous thing?

944
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:02,620
Oh, no!

945
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:03,781
Oh, no! It's a fierce battle!

946
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,240
What? What? What?

947
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,150
Oh, no!

948
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,500
Oh, no!

949
01:18:11,501 --> 01:18:11,940
Oh, no!

950
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,060
Oh, no!

951
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,220
Oh, no!

952
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:15,660
Oh, no!

953
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,200
Oh, no!

954
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,040
It's a fierce battle!

955
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:21,940
Hello!

956
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:31,520
I'm Ai Akabane, but...

957
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,040
Hae-san!

958
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:57,770
Do you know?

959
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,530
Crocodiles kill prey very slowly.

960
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,870
So, they do it suddenly.

961
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,590
Slowly, slowly.

962
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,250
I see.

963
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:12,670
They do it slowly.

964
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:14,390
I've seen it on TV.

965
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,070
Really?

966
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,550
It's a good lesson.

967
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,530
Let's do it slowly today.

968
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:21,890
Slowly, slowly.

969
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:22,410
Slowly, slowly.

970
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:23,730
It's so painful.

971
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,650
It's strange to say that
we're going to get rid of it.

972
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:30,550
But I'm glad.

973
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,110
It's very popular these days.

974
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,290
Oh, really?

975
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,930
I was tired yesterday, too.

976
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,630
I want to do it freely.

977
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,610
I'm tired now.

978
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:50,170
I'm tired, so let us do what we want today.

979
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,470
It's not good.

980
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,990
I'm being teased.

981
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:54,870
I'm being teased.

982
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:57,750
Wait a minute.

983
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,870
I heard you can make a cherry blossom tree.

984
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:02,070
Please.

985
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:03,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

986
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,830
I'm sorry.

987
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,660
Do you like the
string? This is good.

988
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,060


989
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,360
It looks delicious.

990
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,180
It's cute.

991
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,310
I've never been treated
so badly by an old man.

992
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,990
I can't help it because
my partner is a crocodile.

993
01:20:42,991 --> 01:20:43,770
I can't help it because it's my first time.

994
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:44,850
Oh, no!

995
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,410
Oh, no!

996
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:52,210
Oh, no!

997
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,410
Oh, no!

998
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:56,810
Oh, no!

999
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:57,750
Oh, no!

1000
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:58,790
Oh, no!

1001
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,830
Oh, no!

1002
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:00,630
Oh, no!

1003
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:00,910
Oh, no!

1004
01:21:00,911 --> 01:21:00,930
Oh, no!

1005
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:02,730
Oh, no!

1006
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:02,830
Oh, no!

1007
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:03,350
Oh, no!

1008
01:21:03,351 --> 01:21:03,550
Oh, no!

1009
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:04,110
Oh, no!

1010
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:04,630
Oh, no!

1011
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:04,710
Oh, no!

1012
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:05,810
Oh, no!

1013
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,230
Oh, no!

1014
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,570
Oh, no!

1015
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,310
Oh, no!

1016
01:21:12,311 --> 01:21:12,830
Itadakimasu!

1017
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,270
Here we go!

1018
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:24,050
Can you show me how to lick it?

1019
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,630
Wow! You are great!

1020
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:37,130
Come on, everyone!
Cut it in half.

1021
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:38,131
Don't drop it.

1022
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:40,130


1023
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:48,650
Don't drop it, Ichigo.

1024
01:21:55,310 --> 01:22:00,190
Don't drop it.

1025
01:22:00,191 --> 01:22:03,330
Can I eat your butt?

1026
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,090
I like spicy food.

1027
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:14,710
It looks delicious.

1028
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,750
It's feeding time.

1029
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,650
It's delicious, isn't it?

1030
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:27,290
What does it taste like?

1031
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:29,530
It tastes like smoke.

1032
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,630
I don't like smoke.

1033
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,630
It's a cat, isn't it?

1034
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:41,490
I've always had a lot of fun,
but I'm having a lot of fun today.

1035
01:22:56,730 --> 01:23:16,960
Can I tickle you?

1036
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,840
Wow!

1037
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,710
Don't go!

1038
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,050
Let me go!

1039
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:37,490
Let me go!

1040
01:23:37,491 --> 01:23:42,490
Do you want to go?

1041
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:43,790
Yes, I do!

1042
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:46,390
Do you want to go?

1043
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:47,510
Yes, I do!

1044
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:58,550
Great!

1045
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:02,030
Well, she is flawless.

1046
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,750
She is a genius.

1047
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,990
I hate you!

1048
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:33,730
She is a genius!

1049
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:34,110
You are a genius!

1050
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,111
What are you doing?

1051
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:46,750
She is a genius! I'm a teacher.

1052
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:54,580
I'm learning.

1053
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,620
It's painful.

1054
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:13,520


1055
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:36,450
Let me go, please.

1056
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,520
Don't push me.

1057
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,920
I'll go if you push me continuously.

1058
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,160
If you don't want to go, I'll go.

1059
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,780
Wow, amazing!

1060
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,400
Oh, my God!

1061
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:26,460
Wow, amazing!

1062
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:27,540
Oh, my God!

1063
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:27,600
Wow, amazing!

1064
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:28,700
Oh, my God!

1065
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,880
Oh, my God!

1066
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,980
Oh, my God!

1067
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:37,670
Oh, my God!

1068
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:48,600
Do you want to go?

1069
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,240
I want to go!

1070
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:52,760
Well, I'll count to ten, so
you can start from zero.

1071
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:02,180
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1072
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:11,650
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1073
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:26,801
8, 7, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, 1 Can I do it? Of course.

1074
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,160


1075
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,440
Can I?

1076
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,520
I'll do it quickly.

1077
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,360
Oh, my goodness! I can't do it.

1078
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,680
I can't do it.

1079
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,220
I can do it.

1080
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,980
I want to go to the top.

1081
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,400
I want to go.

1082
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:49,400
Let me do it.

1083
01:27:49,401 --> 01:27:50,880
Let me do it.

1084
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,920
Let me do it.

1085
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:56,060
Let's do it again.

1086
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:08,020
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1087
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,760
We did it.

1088
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,740
We did it.

1089
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,800
We did it.

1090
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,840
Thank you.

1091
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:17,400
Thank you.

1092
01:28:17,401 --> 01:28:18,880
Good job!

1093
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,160
Thank you!

1094
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:22,161
One, two, three!

1095
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,080
I can't bear it.

1096
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,300
I can't bear it.

1097
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,720
I can't bear it.

1098
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,020
Can you bear it?

1099
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,740
I can't bear it.

1100
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:39,460
Then, I'll give you a present
for your 20th anniversary.

1101
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,260
Oh, really?

1102
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:43,720
Thank you!

1103
01:28:43,721 --> 01:28:46,140
Oh, is that the plan?

1104
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:48,940
What are you talking
about? I'm sorry.

1105
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:50,820


1106
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,140
You're a bad boy.

1107
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,580
Sit over there.

1108
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,420
Hurry up.

1109
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,060
Let me have a drink.

1110
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,940
I'll have a drink.

1111
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:08,940
Wow! Slowly, slowly.

1112
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,660


1113
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,160
Wow!

1114
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,700
Congratulations!

1115
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,700
Wow!

1116
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:28,380
Wow!

1117
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,220
Wow!

1118
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Wow!

1119
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,660
Do you feel good?

1120
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,480
Do you feel good?

1121
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,660
She is concentrating.

1122
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:50,560
Show me your eyes.

1123
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,560
So cute!

1124
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,220
What should I do? Move more.

1125
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,200
Move more.

1126
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,380
Move more.

1127
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:08,381
Good boy.

1128
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,080
Good boy.

1129
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,080
Good boy.

1130
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:16,940
Good boy.

1131
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,540
Good boy.

1132
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:20,740
Good boy.

1133
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:20,900
Move more.

1134
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,200
Move more.

1135
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:22,760
Good boy.

1136
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,920


1137
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,940
It's good, isn't
it? I'm so nervous.

1138
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,440
I'm so excited.

1139
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,820
I'm so nervous.

1140
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,180


1141
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:14,260
You can't go yet.

1142
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
You can't go yet.

1143
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,560
I'll do my best.

1144
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,760
You can go.

1145
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,700
You can go.

1146
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:34,740
You can go.

1147
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,800
You can't go yet.

You can't go yet.

1149
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,080
You can't go yet.

1150
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:44,500
Not yet? Not yet.

1151
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:44,960


1152
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:45,560
Really?

1153
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,140
Really? Not yet.

1154
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,300


1155
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:49,710
Just a little bit.

1156
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:52,740
No, not yet.

1157
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,020
Halfway through.

1158
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,740
No, not yet.

1159
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:56,640
Not yet.

1160
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:57,641
Just a little bit.

1161
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,100
No, not yet.

1162
01:31:59,800 --> 01:31:59,920

01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:11,580
No, not yet.

1172
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:11,980
No, not yet.

1173
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:12,560
No, not yet.

1174
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,060
No, not yet.

1175
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,061
What is it? It's deep.

1176
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:26,090
It feels good.

1177
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:34,920
It's deep.

1178
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:37,580
It's very deep.

1179
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,580


1180
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:42,800
I took it out a while ago.

1181
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,880
If I take it out now, it will be very deep.

1182
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,020
No, not yet.

1183
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:50,561
OK, but not yet... No
doing it to me! OK, not yet.

1184
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:51,580
Not yet.

1185
01:32:51,581 --> 01:32:51,760


1186
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:52,840
OK.

1187
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:53,940
OK.

1188
01:32:53,941 --> 01:32:54,000
OK.

1189
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,001
Oh, it feels good.

1190
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,500
OK, OK.

1191
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:57,780
OK.

1192
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,180
No, no, no.

1193
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,060
OK, OK.

1194
01:33:00,061 --> 01:33:00,600
No, no, no.

1195
01:33:00,860 --> 01:34:03,040
I said no! OK, OK.

1196
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:03,260
Oh, OK.

1197
01:34:03,261 --> 01:34:03,880
Oh, OK.

1198
01:34:03,881 --> 01:34:03,980
OK, OK.

1199
01:34:03,981 --> 01:34:04,500
Oh, OK.

1200
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:04,680
OK, OK.

1201
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,700
Oh, OK.

1202
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,440
OK, OK.

1203
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:14,420
OK, OK.

1204
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:14,500
OK, OK.

1205
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,780
What's this?

1206
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,180
What's this?

1207
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:19,980
Hey, look here!

1208
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,480
What's this?

1209
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,540
He's a little bit of inside.

1210
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,120
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1211
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:30,800
Oh, oh, me too!

1212
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,060
Oh, that's good!

1213
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,640
It's still big, isn't it?

1214
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,140
It's standing back.

1215
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1216
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,960
I eat a lot of kimchi.

1217
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,080
More.

1218
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:53,281
Can you open your mouth wider?

1219
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,380
Can you open your mouth wider?

1220
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,400
More!

1221
01:34:57,401 --> 01:34:58,100
I want more! I'm so happy.

1222
01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:59,101


1223
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,940
I want more!

1224
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,760
One more!

1225
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:06,780
One more!

1226
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:08,140
How is it? I'm happy.

1227
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:16,000


1228
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,020
How is it?

1229
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,680
A little bit more.

1230
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:41,170
It's getting more painful.

1231
01:35:48,190 --> 01:36:06,680
It's not good to have
an emergency like this.

1232
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,780
Take a deep breath.

1233
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:15,660
Good, good, good.

1234
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:38,660
I want to go there again.

1235
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,560
You've been there many times.

1236
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,200
I've been there many times.

1237
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:51,160
I want to go there again.

1238
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:58,380
I want to go there again.

1239
01:36:58,381 --> 01:37:01,260
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1240
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:09,800
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1241
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:11,700
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1242
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,040
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1243
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,360
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1244
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:40,830
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1245
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:50,400
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1246
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:57,370
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1247
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:57,390
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1248
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:57,570
I can't stand this person
at all, so I'm going to go.

1249
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:58,571
I brought a warm one.

1250
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,390
What is a warm one?

1251
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:10,440
What is a warm one?

1252
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:10,560
What is this?

1253
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,320
Well,

1254
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,480
What is this? I'm sorry.

1255
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,060


1256
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:32,990
I just put it in my mouth.

1257
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:34,530
I just put it in my mouth.

1258
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:42,450
I'm sorry.

1259
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:22,070
I'll punish you.

1260
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:25,740
I didn't stop you at all,

1261
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:26,960
so I'll punish you.

1262
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,820
I'm going to have a meal.

1263
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,000
Oh, my god! I'm so happy.

1264
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,140
I'm so happy.

1265
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:31,400


1266
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,460
I don't want to move.

1267
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,580
I'm so happy.

1268
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:37,450
I'm so happy.

1269
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:39,280
I'm so happy.

1270
01:40:39,281 --> 01:40:40,000
I'm so happy.

1271
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:52,710
I'm so happy.

1272
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,690
I'm so happy.

1273
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,470
I'm so happy.

1274
01:40:56,471 --> 01:41:18,390
It's the 20th anniversary of Madonna.
It's the best.

1275
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,450
I'm going to buy a bra.

1276
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:42,370
Thank you for your hard work.

1277
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:45,430
Thank you for your hard work.

1278
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:56,850
I felt good.

1279
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,860
I'm glad I had a good memory.

1280
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:02,010
I'm strong.

1281
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:04,870
I'm strong.

1282
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,750
I'll get better soon.

1283
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:16,480
That's good.

1284
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,360
Everyone, let's have a drink.

1285
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,500
Let's have a drink.

1286
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:28,940
Let's have a drink.

1287
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:32,410
Let's have a toast.

1288
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,830
I want to drink a lot.

1289
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:40,510
Are you ready? Thank you.

1290
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:43,970


1291
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,170
Cheers! It's good.

1292
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:54,280
It's good.

1293
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,200


1294
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,180
It's good to drink with
such a beautiful woman.

1295
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,280
Let's play a game.

1296
01:43:04,281 --> 01:43:05,281
It's easy to play.

1297
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:06,700
Let's play.

1298
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,160
This is what you taught me.

1299
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:09,960
Oh, that's it.

1300
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,420
This is what you taught me.

1301
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,300
No way.

1302
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,300
Let's play.

1303
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,460
There are a lot.

1304
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:19,420
Let's play.

1305
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:23,380
Please pick one by one.

1306
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:26,420
Ladies first.

1307
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,460
Ladies first.

1308
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,420
Which one?

1309
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:29,760
What should we do?

1310
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:30,760
It doesn't matter.

1311
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,860
All of us? Yes, all of us.

1312
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,260


1313
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:34,620
Hurry up!

1314
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,220
Hurry up!

1315
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:36,480
Hurry up!

1316
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:36,960
Hurry up!

1317
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,200
Pick one!

1318
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,620
Pick one!

1319
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,300
One, two, three!

1320
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,180
Who is it?

1321
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,320
Who is the king? That's fast.

1322
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,260
That's fast.

1323
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:51,800
That's fast.

1324
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:53,140


1325
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,240
What is it? The king.

1326
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:55,200


1327
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:55,840
I'm sure it's the king.

1328
01:43:55,841 --> 01:44:03,880
I'm going to do it like
Madonna's 20th anniversary.

1329
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:09,460
No.4 is... No.7 is...

1330
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,160
Super...

1331

Super...chubby...
Super...chubby... Super...chubby...

1333
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:20,470
Super...chubby...

1334
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:21,920
Who is No.4 and No.

1335
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:22,921
7? Who is it? Number 7.

1336
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,260
Number 4.

1337
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,680


1338
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,100
It's a man's shirt.

1339
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,680
It's a man's shirt.

1340
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:33,640
It's a man's shirt.

1341
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:34,940
I hate this kind of picture.

1342
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,620
It's a man's shirt.

1343
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:37,600
It's a man's shirt.

1344
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,160
It's a man's shirt.

1345
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,400
It's a man's shirt.

1346
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:41,780
I'm sorry.

1347
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,620
This? Excuse me.

1348
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:48,880
Let's start.

1349
01:44:48,881 --> 01:44:49,881


1350
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Wow!

1351
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,340
Wow!

1352
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,920
What?

1353
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:57,860
What?

1354
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:59,020
What?

1355
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:01,310
You are eating a lot.

1356
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:04,300
You are eating a lot.

1357
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,560
What?

1358
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,360
What?

1359
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,440
You are licking.

1360
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,840
What?

1361
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:33,220
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a cute baby.

1362
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,980
I'm so happy.

1363
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,080
I'm so happy.

1364
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,280
I'm so happy.

1365
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,300
I'm so happy.

1366
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,780
Ummmm Hot hot hot

1367
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:54,800
Hot hot hot

1368
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,981
Wow Ummmm

1369
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:06,030
Umm

1370
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:14,700
What do you like?

1371
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:17,780
Osama?

1372
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:28,260
Do you wanna do it again?

1373
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:41,031
Next Let's do it
again Okay, let's do it.

1374
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:42,570
Let's do it.

1375
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:47,310
Ready, set, go!

1376
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:51,790
Who is the king?

1377
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:54,630
Wow!

1378
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,450
It's a little dangerous, isn't it?

1379
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:58,970
What kind of question is this?

1380
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:02,670
I think it's better to attack
more than Velociraptor.

1381
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,350
What? The king is.

1382
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:08,050
..

1383
01:47:08,051 --> 01:47:10,911
The king is... The king is...
What are you doing? The king is.

1384
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:15,690
..

1385
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:19,630
The king is... Number 4's

1386
01:47:20,355 --> 01:47:21,370
sensitive nipples check!

1387
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:24,450
Wait, wait, wait.

1388
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:26,990
The king's nipples are good.

1389
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:28,190
Who is number 4? Number 4.

1390
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:32,170


1391
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,130
Alright, alright.

1392
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:37,110
Please come to the front.

1393
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:39,990
Here you are.

1394
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:42,790
King, please check it.

1395
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:44,610
How can I check it?

1396
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:47,370
Please leave it to me.

1397
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:48,870
Here?

1398
01:47:51,790 --> 01:47:53,830
Please sit down.

1399
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:55,870
It's the same as before.

1400
01:47:58,030 --> 01:47:59,930
Where is it on the yukata?

1401
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:07,930
Oh, wait a minute.

1402
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:10,110
Oh, it's a human!

1403
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:21,310
Can you put your chest up more?

1404
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:22,490
I can't check your chest.

1405
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:24,910
Put your arms back.

1406
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:29,366
I'll do it seriously this time.

1407
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:31,050
No, not yet.

1408
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:42,330
What's this? Wait a minute.

1409
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:44,450


1410
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:47,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1411
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,890
Wait, wait, wait.

1412
01:48:48,891 --> 01:48:49,370
What? What? I don't know.

1413
01:48:49,371 --> 01:48:50,750
I don't know.

1414
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,110
Isn't he the prince's son-in-law?

1415
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:57,670
What?

1416
01:48:58,190 --> 01:48:59,190
Which one?

1417
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:00,530
Wait, wait, wait.

1418
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:02,410
Under the yukata, he might not be.

1419
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,530
I'll hide it.

1420
01:49:04,870 --> 01:49:05,870
What?

1421
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:07,410
Then, please raise your face.

1422
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,730
Look at the prince's eyes.

1423
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:11,290
Wait, wait.

1424
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,790
Look at the prince's eyes.

1425
01:49:12,791 --> 01:49:14,210
Oh, my goodness.

1426
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,160
Wow! A little more.

1427
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:35,780
Wait a minute.

1428
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,560
Please look this way.

1429
01:49:40,561 --> 01:49:45,220
I'm sweating in my chest.

1430
01:49:47,035 --> 01:49:51,960
Look up.

1431
01:49:57,380 --> 01:50:00,380
She is very sensitive.

1432
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:06,280
Is it long?

1433
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:21,680
It's so hot!

1434
01:50:21,681 --> 01:50:22,681
It's so hot!

1435
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:25,240
It's the best!

1436
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,480
Thank you for your hard work!

1437
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:30,660
Let's go!

1438
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:32,100
Is it over?

1439
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:33,720
Let's go!

1440
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,640
Let's go!

1441
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,540
Let's go!

1442
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:44,840
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1443
01:50:44,841 --> 01:50:46,020
Which one is the king?

1444
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:48,360
Yes.

1445
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:49,860
Oh! I see.

1446
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:51,760


1447
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:55,700
What's coming?

1448
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,640
Well, I have a good idea.

1449
01:50:59,480 --> 01:50:59,940
What?

1450
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:00,860
What is it?

1451
01:51:00,861 --> 01:51:12,440
No.2 licks No.6's sensitive
part with his tongue.

1452
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:15,840
Oh!

1453
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,540
You like the tongue, don't you?

1454
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,160
With his tongue.

1455
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,600
It's heavy.

1456
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,320
Who is No.

1457
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:26,580
6? Who is No.2 and No.

1458
01:51:26,581 --> 01:51:27,581
6? Who is it?

1459
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,360
Who is it?

1460
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:31,920
Don't say your name.

1461
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:33,240
Oh, he's here.

1462
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,160
Oh, good.

1463
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:36,561
If I were you, I would have
done it the other way around.

1464
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:38,120
What?

1465
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:39,980
Number 2, Number 2, Number 2.

1466
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,800
Wow.

1467
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,260
Well, well, well.

1468
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,400
Come forward.

1469
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,440
Yes, yes.

1470
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,700
I'm glad I'm not a man.

1471
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:48,620
What? It's dangerous.

1472
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:49,080


1473
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,460
I have to do it with my bare hands.

1474
01:51:50,461 --> 01:51:51,461
I have to take it off.

1475
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,020
You should take it off.

1476
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,640
Wow!

1477
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:00,700
Are you ready?

1478
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,180
I'm looking forward to it.

1479
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:03,420
What's going on?

1480
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,540
Is there something in it?

1481
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:06,940
No, there isn't.

1482
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:08,080
What's going to happen?

1483
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:09,620
This is what happened in the process.

1484
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,420
Is there something in it?

1485
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,040
No, there isn't.

1486
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,360
No, there isn't.

1487
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:17,240
Let's take it off.

1488
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:19,960
Take it off.

1489
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,180
I'm not the king.

1490
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,560
What are you talking about?

1491
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,700
What? Take it off.

1492
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:33,700


1493
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:37,180
I want to see it.

1494
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,280
What did you do?

1495
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,100
I peed my pants.

1496
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,360
You peed your pants?

1497
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:01,440
Well, let me see.

1498
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,320
Oh, no.

1499
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:23,350
Oh, no.

1500
01:53:23,351 --> 01:53:24,450
No, you can't do that.

1501
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:26,980
Everyone can't do that.

1502
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:28,110
Can you lick more?
Next is Asuke.

1503
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:34,040


1504
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:35,620
His tongue is beautiful.

1505
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:38,180
Amazing.

1506
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,320
He is showing his teeth.

1507
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:40,700
He is showing his teeth.

1508
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:42,920
If he shows his teeth, it's over.

1509
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,400
I'm not the king.

1510
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,100
I'm not the king.

1511
01:53:49,630 --> 01:53:51,420
Next is Asuke.

1512
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:57,640
Are you going?

1513
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,400
No, you can't go.

1514
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,540
If you go, I'll go home.

1515
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:23,090
This is dangerous.

1516
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:29,490
Oh! I'm sorry.

1517
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:31,470


1518
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:35,710
I can't do this.

1519
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:38,050
You look like you're
going to stick to the floor.

1520
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,110
I can't do this anymore.

1521
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:43,210
Is this OK?

1522
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:45,530
OK!

1523
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,070
Let's do it again.

1524
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:50,810
Let's do it again.

1525
01:54:51,390 --> 01:54:52,390
Let's do it again.

1526
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:53,910
OK.

1527
01:54:58,490 --> 01:54:59,490
Ready?

1528
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:00,850
Ready?

1529
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,870
Who is this?

1530
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:07,050
Who is this?

1531
01:55:07,051 --> 01:55:08,150
Who is this?

1532
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,530
Yes!

1533
01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:12,190
Oh!

1534
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:16,750
What is she doing?

1535
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:18,190
Well,

1536
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:20,710
Can I do what I want to do?

1537
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:22,590
Oh! I am I'm No.

1538
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:34,770
3, and I'm single.

1539
01:55:38,410 --> 01:55:40,010
No.3!

1540
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:42,670
I'm behind you!

1541
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,130
I'm behind you!

1542
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,670
I can't believe it!

1543
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:49,990
I've never done this before.

1544
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:51,930
I've never done this before.

1545
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:53,226
I've never done this before.

1546
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,410
Can I do this?

1547
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:57,150
Can I?

1548
01:55:57,151 --> 01:55:58,151
Is that so?

1549
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:02,150
Is that so?

1550
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:03,450
Where am I? Here.

1551
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:04,830
From the top.

1552
01:56:05,230 --> 01:56:05,810
From the top.

1553
01:56:05,811 --> 01:56:06,811


1554
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:09,450
It's embarrassing.

1555
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:12,070
It's a great picture.

1556
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:13,150
May I? Yes, you may.

1557
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:14,490
Excuse me.

1558
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:21,390


1559
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:35,990
Oh, it's embarrassing.

1560
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:38,250
Oh, it's embarrassing.

1561
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:39,710
Oh, it's embarrassing.

1562
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:43,890
Oh, it's wet.

1563
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,501
Is it really your first time?

1564
01:56:47,525 --> 01:56:50,670
I think you like it.

1565
01:56:52,490 --> 01:56:53,490
It's good.

1566
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:01,850
Your butt.

1567
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:06,230
Oh, my! That's warm.

1568
01:57:06,650 --> 01:57:09,350


1569
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:11,970
You are being petted.

1570
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:12,971
He is sucking his face.

1571
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,030
He is sucking his face.

1572
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:22,290
He is sucking his face.

1573
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:26,370
I have to teach him.

1574
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,770
I have to make him feel good.

1575
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:30,640
He is feeling good.

1576
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:33,950
He is sucking his face.

1577
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:37,390
He is sucking his face.

1578
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:39,790
He is so strong.

1579
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:45,070
It's good, isn't it?

1580
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,570
I'm looking forward to it.

1581
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:51,790
It's getting fun.

1582
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:54,590
It's fun.

1583
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:56,730
It looks fun.

1584
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:02,950
If you don't use your hands,

1585
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:04,510
just use your mouth.

1586
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:04,990
Just my mouth?

1587
01:58:04,991 --> 01:58:05,991
Only the mouth?

1588
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:08,750
Yes, only the mouth.

1589
01:58:09,530 --> 01:58:13,730
When I release it, it goes like this.

1590
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:18,590
When I release it, it goes like this.

1591
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:29,410
When I release it, it goes like this.

1592
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:30,570
It's fun!

1593
01:58:30,571 --> 01:58:31,571
It's fun!

1594
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:33,190
I hope he's happy.

1595
01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:35,670
The king.

1596
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:38,271
The king seems to be enjoying it.

1597
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:43,450
It's embarrassing.

1598
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:46,970
Oh, no.

1599
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:48,150
It's good.

1600
01:58:51,450 --> 01:58:52,450
The king is having fun.

1601
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:54,490
The king is having fun.

1602
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:55,550
It's good.

1603
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:06,740
I can do it.

1604
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:09,120
No, no, no.

1605
01:59:09,121 --> 01:59:10,121
Not yet.

1606
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,560
Not yet.

1607
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:12,940
Oh, no.

1608
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:14,240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1609
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:18,560
Awesome.

1610
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:23,660
I can't stop.

1611
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,740
Mr. Oshiro, your butt.

1612
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:26,860
My butt.

1613
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:27,960
Your butt.

1614
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:29,020
It's OK.

1615
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,960
It's too long.

1616
01:59:30,961 --> 01:59:32,480
I'm looking forward to it.

1617
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,660
Thank you very much.

1618
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,260
Thank you very much.

1619
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:41,900
I'll do it next time.

1620
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:46,220
One, two, three.

1621
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,220
I'll do what I want to do.

1622
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:54,520
Osamu, Osamu.

1623
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:04,600
What should I do?

1624
02:00:04,601 --> 02:00:05,721
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1625
02:00:07,145 --> 02:00:09,840
I just did a single grip, so I
want to do a mangrove grip.

1626
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,400
It's the other way around.

1627
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:18,380
The king will do a mangrove grip.

1628
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:21,860
Who is number two?

1629
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:24,540
Number two? That was close.

1630
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:30,060
Watch out! Watch out!

1631
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,680
Let's do it! Up, up.

1632
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,860
And this way.

1633
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:38,960


1634
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:41,440
It was turned over just now.

1635
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:44,740
It's yellow, isn't
it? It's great.

1636
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:47,700


1637
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:50,100
Thank you very much.

1638
02:00:50,101 --> 02:00:51,220
Thank you very much.

1639
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:54,900
Do you want an emoji?

1640
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,440
Do you want a normal emoji?

1641
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,340
It's not coming out.

1642
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:10,020
Are you OK? Oh, it's coming out.

1643
02:01:16,225 --> 02:01:17,360
The king is nervous.

1644
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,120
You look like a virgin.

1645
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,020
What?

1646
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:26,340
You look like a virgin.

1647
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:30,180
What? Go, go, go.

1648
02:01:30,181 --> 02:01:31,060
Hey, hey, hey.

1649
02:01:31,061 --> 02:01:31,600


1650
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:33,500
Is that all you've got?

1651
02:01:33,501 --> 02:01:33,940
More?

1652
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,160
More? Go, go, go.

1653
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:39,640


1654
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:41,600
Masato, you're overdoing it.

1655
02:01:50,520 --> 02:02:00,560
「Ai-chan, it's cool!」

1656
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:11,740
I will set the table.

1657
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:21,820
Do you like Kun? Yes, I do.

1658
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:24,240


1659
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:25,980
She said she likes you, Kun.

1660
02:02:25,981 --> 02:02:26,981
Thank you for the meal.

1661
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,200
Are you listening?

1662
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,140
Are you listening?

1663
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,280
Are you listening?

1664
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,360
I'm the king now.

1665
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,780
Don't be selfish.

1666
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,220
Are you listening? Continue.

1667
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:40,740


1668
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:58,930
I'm going to do it.

1669
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:22,850
What are you doing?

1670
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:45,860
Hey!

1671
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,620
I thought you were quiet.

1672
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:52,240
What's the matter?

1673
02:03:52,855 --> 02:03:54,380
I think it's good.

1674
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,660
It's good.

1675
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:59,260
The game is over.

1676
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:03,460
That's good.

1677
02:05:46,560 --> 02:06:14,210
Tama Zoo, Chimpanzee Great.

1678
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:16,070
It feels good.

1679
02:06:19,510 --> 02:06:23,890


1680
02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:33,890
Someone is touching my big hand.

1681
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,730
What are you doing?

1682
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:53,820
Is it fun?

1683
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:13,340
Yes.

1684
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:20,440
Does it feel good?

1685
02:07:38,070 --> 02:07:39,070
Ah!

1686
02:07:42,990 --> 02:07:43,990
Ah!

1687
02:09:03,140 --> 02:09:07,440
Puppies! We are going
to pet them! Oh, that's hot.

1688
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,880
Oh, that's hot.

1689
02:10:46,840 --> 02:11:00,790
Oh, that's hot.

1690
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:03,090


1691
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:05,090
Oh, really? Here you go.

1692
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:11,650
It's cold.

1693
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:13,950


1694
02:11:45,560 --> 02:12:58,460
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

1695
02:12:58,461 --> 02:12:58,580
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

1696
02:12:58,581 --> 02:13:00,461
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

1697
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,321
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

1698
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:09,610
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

1699
02:14:09,611 --> 02:14:09,710
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

1700
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:11,911
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

1701
02:14:16,370 --> 02:14:17,790
【Whimpering】

1702
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:24,470
Are you ok? I'm breathless.

1703
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:25,590


1704
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:26,090
Are you breathless?

1705
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:28,171
【Laughter】 Ah, it feels good.

1706
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:41,681
【Laughter】 I want to do it more.

1707
02:15:01,540 --> 02:16:06,130
【Laughter】 【Groaning】
Ah, ah, I'm going to go.

1708
02:16:06,250 --> 02:16:06,570
Hey!

1709
02:16:06,890 --> 02:16:07,250
You sure?

1710
02:16:07,251 --> 02:16:08,550
I'm in the middle of it.

1711
02:16:09,410 --> 02:16:10,410
I'm in the middle of it.

1712
02:17:57,620 --> 02:17:58,620
I'm sorry.

1713
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:05,110
It's hot.

1714
02:18:34,595 --> 02:18:44,750
Did you fall down?

1715
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,400
The front of the baby is crying.

1716
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:44,200
The baby is crying.

1717
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:46,040
The baby is crying.

1718
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:47,260
The baby is crying.

1719
02:20:33,060 --> 02:20:34,540
Oh my god!

1720
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:51,280
Oh my god!

1721
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:07,440
Oh my god!

1722
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,980
Oh my god!

1723
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,020
Oh my god!

1724
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:11,160
Oh my god!

1725
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:12,700
Oh my god!

1726
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:14,180
Oh my god!

1727
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,920
Oh my god!

1728
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:33,000
Oh my god!

1729
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:33,860
Oh my god!

1730
02:21:33,880 --> 02:21:34,880
Oh my god!

1731
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:35,240
Oh my god! Mom, I'm sorry.

1732
02:21:35,241 --> 02:21:36,520
Mom, I'm sorry.

1733
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:42,700
Mom, I'm sorry.

1734
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:44,680
Mom, I'm sorry.

1735
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:55,980
Oh, it's hot!

1736
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:01,120
Go! Go!

1737
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:07,780
Go! Go! Go!

1738
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:40,930
Oh, it's hot!

1739
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:45,850
Oh, it's hot!

1740
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,100
Oh, it's hot!

1741
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:16,710
Don't leave me!

1742
02:28:01,350 --> 02:28:20,900
What? What? What?

1743
02:29:41,320 --> 02:30:22,880
I'm calling my new co-workers.

1744
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:29,460
Today, we, the Jukujo, are going
to show you how to make this.

1745
02:30:29,461 --> 02:30:32,200
Today, I'd like to teach
you something erotic.

1746
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:35,360
Yes, yes.

1747
02:30:36,340 --> 02:30:37,540
Hey, you.

1748
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:38,960
Yes?

1749
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:42,600
Do you know what's erotic and feels good?

1750
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:48,420
Which part do you think
you feel the most? Well.

1751
02:30:49,900 --> 02:30:51,580
..

1752
02:30:51,581 --> 02:30:52,581
Your pussy? Oh, I'm sorry.

1753
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:55,940
You're so cute.

1754
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:58,030


1755
02:30:58,540 --> 02:30:59,540
You're so simple.

1756
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:01,940
There's more to it.

1757
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:03,580
Oh, yes.

1758
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:08,700
Actually, we have to learn
about these things ourselves.

1759
02:31:10,270 --> 02:31:17,200
But today, we're going to teach you a lot
of things that are weak and easy to feel.

1760
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,300
I'm looking forward to it.

1761
02:31:24,875 --> 02:31:25,875
So cute!

1762
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:30,580
Who would like to go first?

1763
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:35,180
There are so many of you!

1764
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:37,860
What are you going to do?

1765
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:44,060
Oh, it's you!

1766
02:31:46,190 --> 02:31:48,500
Come here!

1767
02:31:48,501 --> 02:31:50,480
Welcome, welcome.

1768
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:59,200
So, we are going to teach
you about erotic things.

1769
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:03,200
So cute.

1770
02:32:04,220 --> 02:32:05,480
Wow.

1771
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:12,900
So, first of all, we are going to
teach you about the feeling of boobs.

1772
02:32:12,901 --> 02:32:15,420
I'm going to tell you
what I like about you.

1773
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,080
Are you looking forward to it?

1774
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:18,580
Yes.

1775
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:21,600
Oh, you, with the glasses.

1776
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:24,180
Come here.

1777
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:26,100
Yes.

1778
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:28,520
In my case,

1779
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:33,100
if you tickle my nipples with
your feather touch, I can feel it.

1780
02:32:36,410 --> 02:32:38,240


1781
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:41,020
I'm glad to hear that.

1782
02:32:41,570 --> 02:32:45,180
Come on, stretch your arms, Boku-chan.

1783
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:47,940
You don't have to be afraid.

1784
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:50,770
Come on, smile.

1785
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,280
Be more gentle.

1786
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:03,060
Don't be too strong.

1787
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:04,980
Yes, be gentle.

1788
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:06,580
Be gentle.

1789
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:08,360
Be gentle, Feather Touch.

1790
02:33:11,020 --> 02:33:12,020
You are so cute.

1791
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:16,720
I feel so good.

1792
02:33:18,980 --> 02:33:20,700
Now, it's your turn.

1793
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:28,200
In my case, I want you to twist it harder.

1794
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,140
No, I don't want to.

1795
02:33:30,620 --> 02:33:36,080
I want you to squeeze my
big nipples a little harder.

1796
02:33:36,330 --> 02:33:37,940
I want you to pinch me.

1797
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:39,720
No!

1798
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:40,820
Is it like this?

1799
02:33:41,740 --> 02:33:42,740
No!

1800
02:33:43,580 --> 02:33:45,200
You look at me at such a close distance.

1801
02:33:47,300 --> 02:33:48,300
You are my sister.

1802
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:51,300
Don't be shy. Come here.

1803
02:33:51,770 --> 02:33:53,080
Come on.

1804
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:55,960
Come on?

1805
02:33:57,100 --> 02:33:58,120
Come on?

1806
02:33:58,280 --> 02:33:59,280
How is it?

1807
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:00,620
Not good at all.

1808
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:01,840
Harder.

1809
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:03,640
I can't do it.

1810
02:34:03,641 --> 02:34:04,641
I'm sorry.

1811
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:06,600
More firmly.

1812
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:08,420
Oh, it hurts.

1813
02:34:11,555 --> 02:34:13,100
Roll me back more.

1814
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,740
It feels good.

1815
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:23,480
Feel it more.

1816
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:27,320
You're getting
better! Good girl.

1817
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:31,600


1818
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:40,140
Today is a special lesson of practice.

1819
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:45,640
Let's have a study session.

1820
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:47,160
I'm sad.

1821
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:56,320
This chest, too.

1822
02:34:56,360 --> 02:34:57,360
Welcome.

1823
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:58,700
Both hands.

1824
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:37,540
You have a talent.

1825
02:35:39,300 --> 02:35:40,760
You look sexy.

1826
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:42,820
You have a talent.

1827
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:44,780
You have to practice more.

1828
02:35:48,620 --> 02:35:51,440
Don't be shy.

1829
02:35:57,320 --> 02:35:59,940
Touch the feather more.

1830
02:35:59,941 --> 02:36:02,500
You can turn it over.

1831
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:04,320
Oh, no.

1832
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:07,840
Your nipple is sticking out of the hole.

1833
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:09,980
Oh, no.

1834
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,160
Oh, no.

1835
02:36:13,940 --> 02:36:14,940
Oh, no.

1836
02:36:17,020 --> 02:36:17,260
Oh, no.

1837
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:19,040
Oh, no.

1838
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:20,260
Oh, no.

1839
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:21,420
Oh, no.

1840
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:23,940
Oh, no.

1841
02:36:23,941 --> 02:36:24,480
Oh, no.

1842
02:36:24,481 --> 02:36:25,520
Oh, no.

1843
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:27,620
Oh, no.

1844
02:36:27,621 --> 02:36:28,520
Oh, no.

1845
02:36:28,521 --> 02:36:29,521
Oh, no.

1846
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:30,780
Oh, no.

1847
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:45,238
It's a double-breasted
cat, so it's hard on

1848
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:53,500
this side and feather-touched
on the other side.

1849
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:00,880
Oh, yes.

1850
02:37:01,580 --> 02:37:02,820
It feels good,
doesn't it? Oh, wow.

1851
02:37:04,730 --> 02:37:05,940
You're amazing.

1852
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:08,080


1853
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:09,240
You're the best.

1854
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:12,160
Oh, more.

1855
02:37:12,340 --> 02:37:13,500
You're making me feel better.

1856
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:15,520
Oh, yes.

1857
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,720
It's getting better.

1858
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:24,020
Oh, it feels good.

1859
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,300
I'm getting wet.

1860
02:37:25,301 --> 02:37:28,300
I'm going to get wet with my nipples.

1861
02:37:32,020 --> 02:37:33,760
This baby is good.

1862
02:37:34,940 --> 02:37:36,320
This baby is good.

1863
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:44,520
I'm getting wet with my nipples.

1864
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:48,120
Oh, I'm getting wet with my nipples.

1865
02:37:48,121 --> 02:37:49,480
Yucchi, I'm sorry.

1866
02:37:49,481 --> 02:37:51,160
I don't want to do this anymore.

1867
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:53,820
I can feel it.

1868
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:55,600
Yucchi.

1869
02:37:55,920 --> 02:38:01,700
I'll teach you more.

1870
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:03,140
I'll hold your hand.

1871
02:38:04,510 --> 02:38:05,510
I'll keep teaching you.

1872
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,540
I'm sorry.

1873
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:22,520
They haven't given birth
yet and he's losing his breath.

1874
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:28,120
He may be satisfied with only pumps
when he croises with his mother.

1875
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:43,290
Their father, Naruniyo, who is a carpenter,
is waiting for his mother to give birth.

1876
02:38:43,750 --> 02:38:44,750
I love it.

1877
02:38:45,010 --> 02:38:46,010
Let's eat it.

1878
02:38:48,430 --> 02:38:52,930
It feels good.

1879
02:38:54,070 --> 02:38:55,730
I'm sorry.

1880
02:38:57,470 --> 02:38:59,010
I'm getting hot.

1881
02:39:00,270 --> 02:39:03,870
It feels good.

1882
02:39:07,155 --> 02:39:10,410
I'll tell you how I feel now.

1883
02:39:10,411 --> 02:39:12,270
I'll teach you how to do it.

1884
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,030
I'll start from your boobs.

1885
02:39:16,530 --> 02:39:19,510
You want to touch it as soon
as possible, don't you? It's OK.

1886
02:39:19,910 --> 02:39:20,910
Welcome.

1887
02:39:22,020 --> 02:39:23,020
Don't be shy.

1888
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:27,330


1889
02:39:28,390 --> 02:39:29,790
Where do you feel good?

1890
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:31,950
Stretch your arms.

1891
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:36,830
I'll start from here.

1892
02:39:40,410 --> 02:39:41,410
Oh, I'm so happy!

1893
02:39:42,550 --> 02:39:44,290
I'm so happy!

1894
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:46,010
It's getting hot.

1895
02:39:47,490 --> 02:39:49,090
I can't believe I can see you so close.

1896
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:57,290
I want you to touch me here.

1897
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:02,890
Come here, Maki.

1898
02:40:05,070 --> 02:40:07,550
Oh, you're embarrassed in the middle.

1899
02:40:07,551 --> 02:40:12,370
I will teach you how to do it.

1900
02:40:13,825 --> 02:40:15,350
Come here.

1901
02:40:16,270 --> 02:40:17,270
Where was it? Don't be shy.

1902
02:40:17,410 --> 02:40:18,770


1903
02:40:20,970 --> 02:40:21,970
Wow!

1904
02:40:23,810 --> 02:40:24,810
You are so good.

1905
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:27,650
You can do it.

1906
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:29,550
You are so good.

1907
02:40:31,950 --> 02:40:33,670
Wow!

1908
02:40:34,230 --> 02:40:36,310
You can do that, too?

1909
02:40:36,311 --> 02:40:37,311
Great! Be gentle.

1910
02:40:38,490 --> 02:40:39,490
Be gentle.

1911
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:41,550


1912
02:40:42,050 --> 02:40:43,050
Take care of yourself.

1913
02:40:43,665 --> 02:40:44,665
Sleep well.

1914
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:48,610
Kuri-chan is moving.

1915
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:51,270
She turned pink.

1916
02:40:52,010 --> 02:40:53,010
Really? She looks cute.

1917
02:40:53,270 --> 02:40:54,730


1918
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:58,970
Her fingers are wet.

1919
02:41:00,050 --> 02:41:00,690
I'm sad.

1920
02:41:00,691 --> 02:41:01,691
Wow!

1921
02:41:03,030 --> 02:41:05,210
It's so shiny!

1922
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:09,050
You came so close!

1923
02:41:10,330 --> 02:41:11,330
Mr. Greedy!

1924
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:18,770
You want to lick it, don't you?

1925
02:41:18,850 --> 02:41:19,850
No!

1926
02:41:20,310 --> 02:41:21,490
Do you want to lick it?

1927
02:41:22,630 --> 02:41:23,630
Wow!

1928
02:41:41,890 --> 02:41:47,110
It's hot, isn't it? It feels good.

1929
02:41:48,090 --> 02:41:48,770
I'm getting jealous.

1930
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:50,270
Oh, you brought a mango.

1931
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:52,210
May I? Yes, you may.

1932
02:41:52,930 --> 02:41:54,070


1933
02:41:55,350 --> 02:41:56,670
Come to the center.

1934
02:42:02,710 --> 02:42:03,980
I have a different mango.

1935
02:42:04,700 --> 02:42:06,820
Nice to meet you, Lingerie.

1936
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:08,440
You're so sexy.

1937
02:42:09,460 --> 02:42:12,700
How do you like to be touched?

1938
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:14,800
Which side do you like?

1939
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:17,240
I'll do this side.

1940
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:18,940
Nice to meet you.

1941
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:24,240
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a cute cat.

1942
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:33,260
I'm so happy to see such a cute cat.

1943
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:41,980
I'm so happy to see such a cute cat.

1944
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:48,340
I'm so happy to see such a cute cat.

1945
02:42:48,341 --> 02:42:49,341
Hello.

1946
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:51,740
Please touch her.

1947
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:52,840
Yes.

1948
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:54,040
Please touch her.

1949
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,640
But I won't tell you how
to make her feel good.

1950
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:59,780
But you already know, don't you?

1951
02:43:00,160 --> 02:43:01,160
I'll look for it.

1952
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:02,700
You'll look for it.

1953
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:06,040
Where is it?

1954
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:08,080
How is it?

1955
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:09,540
Wow.

1956
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:10,780
It came to me.

1957
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:12,940
Was it correct?

1958
02:43:13,980 --> 02:43:14,400
Oh.

1959
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:15,740
I was surprised.

1960
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:17,740
I'm sorry.

1961
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:20,020
Good job.

1962
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:22,100
There, there, there.

1963
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:23,880
You're good at it.

1964
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:26,460
But you know what?

1965
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:28,680
You have to look at Guri's face properly.

1966
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:31,960
I see.

1967
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:35,100
From now on,

1968
02:43:36,355 --> 02:43:37,955
you have to touch her gently and slowly.

1969
02:43:40,380 --> 02:43:41,440
Can you do it?

1970
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:44,580
Be gentle, be gentle.

1971
02:43:49,100 --> 02:43:53,720
Oh, she's lowering her head.

1972
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,400
She's lowering her head.

1973
02:43:58,880 --> 02:43:59,880
You're good.

1974
02:44:00,495 --> 02:44:02,240
Next time, touch from below and trace.

1975
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:05,080
Is it right? There, there.

1976
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:10,880


1977
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:17,800
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

1978
02:44:17,801 --> 02:44:18,801
The stars are
moving! Yes, yes, yes.

1979
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:20,000


1980
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:21,880
And now you're going to spin.

1981
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:24,320
Guri-chan, you're going to spin.

1982
02:44:24,710 --> 02:44:25,820
Yes, yes, yes.

1983
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:29,140
Your fingers are wet, Yoroshiku
onegaishimasu! No, no, no.

1984
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:30,240


1985
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:34,620
Yes, yes, you're doing great.

1986
02:44:37,900 --> 02:44:39,220
Wow, it feels so good!

1987
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:40,880
I wonder if I can make you laugh.

1988
02:44:40,881 --> 02:44:41,921
I wonder if you can do it.

1989
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:43,700
I wonder if you can do it.

1990
02:44:45,540 --> 02:44:49,780
You can do it.

1991
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:51,400
You can do it.

1992
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:53,940
You don't have to be patient.

1993
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:56,700
You can do it.

1994
02:44:57,800 --> 02:45:00,440
You can do it.

1995
02:45:00,441 --> 02:45:06,270
You can do it.

1996
02:45:06,310 --> 02:45:06,590
You can do it.

1997
02:45:06,591 --> 02:45:07,591
You can do it.

1998
02:45:16,690 --> 02:45:18,240
You can do it.

1999
02:45:32,030 --> 02:45:45,800
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

2000
02:45:45,801 --> 02:45:45,980

2001

2003

It is a derivative work

2004
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:04,380
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

2005
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:07,360
It's been a while since I've seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

2006
02:46:07,361 --> 02:46:08,361
I'm sorry.

2007
02:46:12,140 --> 02:46:24,160
Chiho I want you too.

2008
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:29,680


2009
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:31,340
Do you want me, too? Welcome.

2010
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:32,880


2011
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:50,010
Today, I'm going to
tell you a story about a

2012
02:46:50,022 --> 02:46:55,220
cat that I met for the
first time in my life.

2013
02:46:55,470 --> 02:46:58,790
I'm going to tell you a story about a cat
that I met for the first time in my life.

2014
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:01,440
Today is a special day.

2015
02:47:02,020 --> 02:47:03,840
If you look up, you'll see something bad.

2016
02:47:04,700 --> 02:47:06,020
You're right. It's something bad.

2017
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:08,340
It's a nice view.

2018
02:47:08,980 --> 02:47:09,680
It's a nice view.

2019
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:10,700
It feels good.

2020
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:11,040
It's amazing.

2021
02:47:11,675 --> 02:47:12,940
It's coming. It's coming.

2022
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:13,860
It's coming. It's coming.

2023
02:47:13,861 --> 02:47:14,260
It's coming. It's coming.

2024
02:47:14,261 --> 02:47:14,780
It's coming. It's coming.

2025
02:47:14,781 --> 02:47:19,820
Can I use a toy to
attack? It's coming.

2026
02:47:20,980 --> 02:47:21,980
It's coming.

2027
02:47:22,340 --> 02:47:23,340
It's good.

2028
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:24,460


2029
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:26,520
I'm over there!

2030
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:28,360
I'm over here!

2031
02:47:29,380 --> 02:47:30,740
Wow, you're so good at this!

2032
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:32,500
Look, I have a toy!

2033
02:47:32,560 --> 02:47:33,680
Wow, you're so good at this!

2034
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:46,120
You and Chikubin are
attacking at the same time!

2035
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:50,480
You all have talent.

2036
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:52,040
That's right.

2037
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:55,380
You want to grow up more, don't you?

2038
02:47:57,305 --> 02:48:08,730
If I make you feel good, you will grow up.

2039
02:48:10,310 --> 02:48:12,890
Don't be shy.

2040
02:48:16,350 --> 02:48:18,190
You can think of it as a practice table.

2041
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:21,830
You are great.

2042
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:24,490
You brought a great one.

2043
02:48:24,491 --> 02:48:25,491
He's coming back.

2044
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:27,630
A little more.

2045
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:29,190
Be gentle.

2046
02:48:29,530 --> 02:48:31,950
Aim at his neck.

2047
02:48:35,410 --> 02:48:37,470
No, no, no.

2048
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:39,770
It feels good.

2049
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:42,530
Wow, wow, wow.

2050
02:48:43,190 --> 02:48:45,730
I can feel it everywhere.

2051
02:48:46,030 --> 02:48:47,450
I know where you can feel it.

2052
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,990
He's coming back.

2053
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:14,730
Rub, rub.

2054
02:49:15,430 --> 02:49:16,430
Oh, wow.

2055
02:49:18,450 --> 02:49:20,190
Oh, wow, wow.

2056
02:49:22,510 --> 02:49:23,710
Oh, good, good.

2057
02:50:08,810 --> 02:50:10,250
I'm going to fall.

2058
02:50:10,330 --> 02:50:12,170
I'm going to fall.

2059
02:50:32,515 --> 02:50:34,550
Hurry up.

2060
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:37,130
Help me.

2061
02:50:38,110 --> 02:50:39,470
I can't stand it anymore.

2062
02:50:40,690 --> 02:50:41,890
Please.

2063
02:50:45,670 --> 02:50:47,110
Come here.

2064
02:50:47,510 --> 02:50:48,510
This way.

2065
02:50:49,310 --> 02:50:52,490
Come here.

2066
02:50:52,491 --> 02:50:55,770
Wow, it's big.

2067
02:50:56,290 --> 02:50:59,710
Let's see where you can get in.

2068
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:11,040
Does it feel good?

2069
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:13,140
Do you feel good?

2070
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:20,760
You move so well.

2071
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:23,120
You move so well.

2072
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:25,760
You move so well.

2073
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:29,200
You move so well.

2074
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:29,460
You move so well.

2075
02:51:29,461 --> 02:51:30,461
You move so well.

2076
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:31,440
You move so well.

2077
02:51:31,441 --> 02:51:31,480
You move so well.

2078
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:33,040
You move so well.

2079
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:34,940
You move so well.

2080
02:51:36,980 --> 02:51:39,020
You move so well.

2081
02:51:39,021 --> 02:51:40,240
I'm sorry.

2082
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:41,680
I'm so sorry.

2083
02:51:43,720 --> 02:51:45,440
What's going on? I don't know.

2084
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:46,620


2085
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:50,040
Do you know what's good about it?

2086
02:51:50,910 --> 02:51:51,980
Are you shaking?

2087
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:53,600
Are you shaking?

2088
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:55,140
Are you fighting?

2089
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:56,720
Wow!

2090
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:01,720
Are you angry? I can't do it.

2091
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:04,460
I can't do it.

2092
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:06,620


2093
02:52:07,400 --> 02:52:09,360
Look at the angle.

2094
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:16,550
You are so kind.

2095
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:22,730
You are so kind.

2096
02:52:24,450 --> 02:52:26,690
I want it, too.

2097
02:52:26,850 --> 02:52:29,730
I want it, too.

2098
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:33,390
I want it, too.

2099
02:52:33,391 --> 02:52:36,570
I envy you.

2100
02:52:36,571 --> 02:52:37,571
I'm so happy.

2101
02:52:42,260 --> 02:52:43,750
Please do it more comfortably.

2102
02:52:45,610 --> 02:52:50,070
I'm so happy.

2103
02:52:51,550 --> 02:52:53,250
I'm so happy.

2104
02:52:53,251 --> 02:52:55,070
Please do it more comfortably.

2105
02:52:55,730 --> 02:52:57,230
I'm so happy.

2106
02:52:57,870 --> 02:52:59,070
Please do it more comfortably.

2107
02:52:59,810 --> 02:53:01,010
Come on, do it.

2108
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:03,960
Wow.

2109
02:53:05,530 --> 02:53:06,570
It's done.

2110
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:07,920
Oh, it's gone.

2111
02:53:09,470 --> 02:53:10,550
It's gone.

2112
02:53:15,470 --> 02:53:17,670
A lot of it came out.

2113
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:22,250
I'm so happy.

2114
02:53:22,251 --> 02:53:23,251
It's so rich.

2115
02:53:24,150 --> 02:53:26,010
As expected of young people.

2116
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:28,270
Who's going to give me a kiss?

2117
02:53:28,770 --> 02:53:29,770
Me!

2118
02:53:30,330 --> 02:53:31,370
Me, too!

2119
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:32,650
Me, too!

2120
02:53:32,790 --> 02:53:32,990
I want you to give me a kiss, too.

2121
02:53:32,991 --> 02:53:35,010
Tokoroto-kun, come here.

2122
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,710
What are you doing?

2123
02:53:40,850 --> 02:53:42,690
You already know how to do it, don't you?

2124
02:53:44,730 --> 02:53:45,730
You're really doing it.

2125
02:53:46,850 --> 02:53:48,330
It's almost ready.

2126
02:53:54,050 --> 02:53:58,910
It's big.

2127
02:53:58,911 --> 02:54:01,490
Oh, it's stiff.

2128
02:54:01,870 --> 02:54:03,530
Oh, I am relieved.

2129
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:08,890
Oh, feels good.

2130
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:14,550
Feels good.

2131
02:54:15,790 --> 02:54:16,790
Feels good.

2132
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:20,230
It's great.

2133
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:26,870
Oh, I am relieved.

2134
02:54:27,590 --> 02:54:27,790
It feels great.

2135
02:54:27,791 --> 02:54:28,791
I am relieved.

2136
02:54:28,890 --> 02:54:33,900
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

2137
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:47,750
I'm so touched.

2138
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:13,780
I'm so touched.

2139
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:21,120
I'm so touched.

2140
02:55:24,020 --> 02:55:25,620
I'm so touched.

2141
02:55:57,260 --> 02:55:58,950
It feels so good!

2142
02:55:59,930 --> 02:56:01,170
It's so hot!

2143
02:56:05,070 --> 02:56:06,450
Wow!

2144
02:56:11,290 --> 02:56:12,490
I love it!

2145
02:56:21,490 --> 02:56:23,870
Please eat more.

2146
02:56:24,870 --> 02:56:26,270
Don't stop eating.

2147
02:56:27,230 --> 02:56:29,410
Please lick my hand.

2148
02:56:31,990 --> 02:56:34,250
Please do more.

2149
02:56:36,990 --> 02:56:39,490
Please lick my hand.

2150
02:56:39,630 --> 02:56:42,210
Does it feel good?

2151
02:56:47,850 --> 02:56:49,190
Oh, it feels so good.

2152
02:56:50,550 --> 02:56:52,850
Let's get better.

2153
02:56:54,650 --> 02:56:57,950
I want to come here more and more.

2154
02:57:01,090 --> 02:57:06,190
Oh, it feels so good.

2155
02:57:06,980 --> 02:57:08,450
It's so hot!

2156
02:57:08,850 --> 02:57:10,370
It's so hot!

2157
02:57:11,210 --> 02:57:14,110
I can't stand it anymore.

2158
02:57:14,330 --> 02:57:15,330
Are you okay?

2159
02:57:15,830 --> 02:57:17,010
It's so hot!

2160
02:57:18,630 --> 02:57:27,990
Let me feel more comfortable.

2161
02:57:29,650 --> 02:57:32,370
Let me feel more comfortable.

2162
02:57:32,371 --> 02:57:34,370
Let me hug you.

2163
02:57:44,240 --> 02:57:45,680
Give me a hug.

2164
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:52,520
Give me a hug.

2165
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:54,980
Give me a hug.

2166
02:57:56,060 --> 02:57:59,360
Hold my hand.

2167
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:07,540
You are getting better.

2168
02:58:07,541 --> 02:58:10,380
Shake your hips more.

2169
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:11,400
Shake your hips more.

2170
02:58:11,401 --> 02:58:12,401
Sit down.

2171
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:15,120
Sit down.

2172
02:58:20,270 --> 02:58:21,270
Go inside.

2173
02:58:23,810 --> 02:58:24,810
Go inside.

2174
02:58:25,370 --> 02:58:26,370
Go inside.

2175
02:58:33,350 --> 02:58:34,790
Go inside.

2176
02:58:34,791 --> 02:58:35,210
Go inside.

2177
02:58:35,211 --> 02:58:35,390
Go inside.

2178
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:35,470
Go inside.

2179
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:40,930
Go inside.

2180
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:44,890
The red tank top is so cute!

2181
02:58:46,630 --> 02:58:48,790
It's so cute, isn't it?

2182
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:55,210
It feels so good!

2183
02:58:58,030 --> 02:59:00,410
You're good at it!

2184
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:04,090
It feels so good!

2185
02:59:04,091 --> 02:59:06,390
Oh my god, oh my god.

2186
02:59:08,330 --> 02:59:09,330
Oh my god, oh my god.

2187
02:59:09,685 --> 02:59:29,200
It's so great.

2188
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:33,720
Ah, more! More! Oh, great.

2189
03:00:00,340 --> 03:00:01,380
Oh, great.

2190
03:00:02,620 --> 03:00:22,110


2191
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:59,530
You did a great job on the
two-day trip to the hot springs.

2192
03:01:33,540 --> 03:01:34,720
That's close.

2193
03:01:34,721 --> 03:01:35,721
It's so close.

2194
03:01:37,940 --> 03:01:55,680
It's so close.

2195
03:01:55,700 --> 03:01:55,720
It's so close.

2196
03:01:55,721 --> 03:01:55,740
It's so close.

2197
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:55,840
It's so close.

2198
03:01:55,841 --> 03:01:55,880
It's so close.

2199
03:01:56,660 --> 03:01:57,660
It's so close.

2200
03:01:58,780 --> 03:01:59,200
It's so close.

2201
03:01:59,300 --> 03:01:59,420
It's so close.

2202
03:02:00,020 --> 03:02:00,940
It's so close.

2203
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:06,770
It's so close.

2204
03:02:07,230 --> 03:02:07,930
It's so close.

2205
03:02:08,150 --> 03:02:08,610
It's so close.

2206
03:02:08,611 --> 03:02:11,651
I was wondering what would happen if I
was surrounded by MADAME and TATSUMI,

2207
03:02:14,490 --> 03:02:19,130
but I had a lot of new experiences
from the beginning to the end.

2208
03:02:19,630 --> 03:02:21,130
It was a lot of fun.

2209
03:02:21,770 --> 03:02:23,150
I'm glad I moved here.

2210
03:02:23,810 --> 03:02:24,810
Thank you.

2211
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:30,030
I'm Yumi Kazama.

2212
03:02:31,910 --> 03:02:33,990
I had a lot of fun in no time.

2213
03:02:33,991 --> 03:02:38,030
It was fun. I don't know how many
times I've said it, but I feel so good.

2214
03:02:40,350 --> 03:02:43,610
I still have a lot of things to do,
so I want to do something erotic.

2215
03:02:44,970 --> 03:02:46,510
Thank you very much. It was fun.

2216
03:02:48,530 --> 03:02:52,170
Hi, I'm Marina Shiraishi.

2217
03:02:53,190 --> 03:02:59,770
It was a two-day hot spring trip, but
I was able to meet a lot of actresses.

2218
03:02:59,771 --> 03:03:04,720
I was able to meet a lot of actresses, and I was able to
get along with a lot of actresses, so I would be happy if

2219
03:03:04,732 --> 03:03:09,650
I could have the opportunity to shoot and have an event
where actresses from MADONNA will gather again this time.

2220
03:03:12,850 --> 03:03:17,070
Everyone, please pull out a lot.
Thank you very much.

2221
03:03:19,890 --> 03:03:22,788
I was able to participate
in a special project

2222
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:25,710
for the 20th anniversary,
and it was very fun.

2223
03:03:25,711 --> 03:03:31,305
It was fun. I got tired of
the hot spring. I would like to

2224
03:03:31,317 --> 03:03:36,730
come here again if I have a
chance. Thank you very much.

2225
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:44,583
Thank you for the two-day stay. I was
able to perform with many actresses.

2226
03:03:44,595 --> 03:03:50,790
It was very exciting and fun. I will
never forget it. Thank you very much.

2227
03:03:50,791 --> 03:03:51,791
I did it!

2228
03:03:54,050 --> 03:03:56,350
Thank you for your hard work.
I'm Aoi Ichino.

2229
03:03:58,150 --> 03:04:03,030
It was my first time to perform today.

2230
03:04:03,970 --> 03:04:06,775
I was very nervous
among the seniors, but I

2231
03:04:06,787 --> 03:04:09,670
was able to show
myself, so it was very fun.

2232
03:04:10,430 --> 03:04:13,310
If I have a chance, I would
like to challenge again.

2233
03:04:14,910 --> 03:04:16,110
Thank you very much.

2234
03:04:16,111 --> 03:04:17,990
Hi, I'm Reihaya.

2235
03:04:18,910 --> 03:04:21,150
I had a quick toast and drank it.

2236
03:04:22,250 --> 03:04:23,250
Thank you for the meal.

2237
03:04:25,470 --> 03:04:29,070
I was very impressed by this movie.

2238
03:04:29,330 --> 03:04:30,570
It was a lot of fun.

2239
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:33,830
It's a very erotic scene.

2240
03:04:34,630 --> 03:04:35,630
It's rare.

2241
03:04:36,670 --> 03:04:39,270
I think I took a lot of
scenes that I can't show you.

2242
03:04:39,670 --> 03:04:42,130
I hope you'll enjoy it.

2243
03:04:42,131 --> 03:04:44,510
Congratulations on your 20th anniversary.

2244
03:04:45,890 --> 03:04:47,510
Thank you very much.

2245
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:50,150
I had a great experience.

2246
03:04:52,970 --> 03:04:54,930
I still have a long way to go.

2247
03:04:55,330 --> 03:04:56,330
What?

2248
03:04:57,790 --> 03:04:59,710
I still have a long way to go.

2249
03:05:00,010 --> 03:05:00,630
You still have a long
way to go? Yes, I do.

2250
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:03,470
I told you before.

2251
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:06,990
I still have a long way to go.

2252
03:05:07,790 --> 03:05:09,210
I want to appear in your dreams.

2253
03:05:09,211 --> 03:05:10,211
I can't get out of it.

2254
03:05:11,390 --> 03:05:12,390
You can't get out of it?

2255
03:05:12,550 --> 03:05:12,790
No.

2256
03:05:13,390 --> 03:05:14,390
Oh, really?

2257
03:05:14,900 --> 03:05:15,900
Is it because of me?

2258
03:05:16,330 --> 03:05:17,810
I was thinking about it.

2259
03:05:19,890 --> 03:05:21,890
It was fun.

2260
03:05:22,430 --> 03:05:23,430
It was fun.

2261
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:25,650
Thank you.

2262
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:29,000
Thank you for your hard work.

2263
03:05:30,070 --> 03:05:30,610
Thank you for your hard work.

2264
03:05:30,970 --> 03:05:31,970
There is a camera.

2265
03:05:32,510 --> 03:05:34,530
Thank you for the two days.

2266
03:05:35,910 --> 03:05:37,090
It was fun.

2267
03:05:37,091 --> 03:05:39,690
I'm so happy to meet you all.

2268
03:05:39,691 --> 03:05:40,710
Thank you.

2269
03:05:41,270 --> 03:05:44,810
I'm so happy to meet various
actresses and get along with them.

2270
03:05:46,290 --> 03:05:48,530
Thank you so much.

2271
03:05:49,690 --> 03:05:51,550
Please watch our movie a lot.

2272
03:05:52,430 --> 03:05:54,610
I've learned a lot.

2273
03:05:55,390 --> 03:05:56,930
Thank you so much.

2274
03:05:57,750 --> 03:06:02,550
Thank you for your hard work.

2275
03:06:02,551 --> 03:06:03,711
Thank you for your hard work.

2276
03:06:06,420 --> 03:06:08,650
Thank you for your hard work.

2277
03:06:09,530 --> 03:06:10,750
I had a lot of fun.

2278
03:06:11,190 --> 03:06:12,210
How was it?

2279
03:06:12,390 --> 03:06:14,570
I became the sexiest person in the world.

2280
03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:17,240
Me, too.

2281
03:06:17,450 --> 03:06:18,690
Thank you for your hard work.

2282
03:06:21,370 --> 03:06:22,790
Thank you for your hard work.

2283
03:06:23,470 --> 03:06:24,630
Thank you for your hard work.

2284
03:06:24,910 --> 03:06:25,910
Cheers!

2285
03:06:26,870 --> 03:06:29,350
It was rough, but I overcame it.

2286
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:31,380
Thank you for your hard work.

2287
03:06:32,550 --> 03:06:34,710
Ms. Madonna, congratulations
on your 20th anniversary.

2288
03:06:35,850 --> 03:06:36,850
Thank you very much.

2289
03:06:38,830 --> 03:06:43,390
Today, I was able to
collaborate with 21 actresses.

2290
03:06:44,370 --> 03:06:45,510
I learned a lot.

2291
03:06:47,410 --> 03:06:49,010
I was able to collaborate with a legend.

2292
03:06:50,450 --> 03:06:51,850
Is this the second time?

2293
03:06:52,610 --> 03:06:54,070
No, it's the third time.

2294
03:06:54,750 --> 03:06:56,070
I learned a lot.

2295
03:06:56,470 --> 03:06:58,170
I saw the episode up close.

2296
03:06:59,250 --> 03:07:00,650
Thank you very much.

2297
03:07:00,651 --> 03:07:01,810
Thank you very much.

2298
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:02,910
Please enjoy it.

2299
03:07:05,550 --> 03:07:07,310
Thank you very much.

2300
03:07:08,290 --> 03:07:11,030
Thank you very much.

2301
03:07:12,770 --> 03:07:13,770
Cheers! I'm Yuka Tadai.

2302
03:07:15,310 --> 03:07:16,810


2303
03:07:17,230 --> 03:07:18,230
I'm Haruka Rukawa.

2304
03:07:19,010 --> 03:07:20,830
Thanks to all of you,

2305
03:07:21,330 --> 03:07:23,170
I was able to participate
in this great event.

2306
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:27,110
And the party was over safely.

2307
03:07:27,390 --> 03:07:28,930
I'm really grateful.

2308
03:07:28,931 --> 03:07:34,310
We look forward to working
with you in the future as well.

2309
03:07:35,490 --> 03:07:37,190
It was fun.

2310
03:07:37,890 --> 03:07:39,490
It was really fun.

2311
03:07:41,830 --> 03:07:43,890
We got drunk.

2312
03:07:44,410 --> 03:07:45,410
We got drunk.

2313
03:07:45,450 --> 03:07:46,450
It was too fun.

2314
03:07:46,670 --> 03:07:47,670
We got carried away.

2315
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:51,850
It was great to be able to
participate in such an event.

2316
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:55,470
I'm the newest member.

2317
03:07:56,310 --> 03:07:59,210
I'm a newcomer, but I had a lot of fun.

2318
03:08:00,170 --> 03:08:03,910
Thank you for inviting me.
I'll do my best from now on.

2319
03:08:04,310 --> 03:08:05,310
I'll do my best.

2320
03:08:05,470 --> 03:08:06,470
Thank you.

2321
03:08:11,490 --> 03:08:13,230
Are you kidding me?

2322
03:08:14,810 --> 03:08:16,210
I don't know how to end this.

2323
03:08:18,150 --> 03:08:19,410
Are you going to run away?

2324
03:08:19,411 --> 03:08:20,411
I'm going to do it.

2325
03:08:24,370 --> 03:08:38,580
You're still not enough, are you?

2326
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:08,760
Oh, my God!

2327
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:25,640
Oh, my God!

2328
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:19,660
Oh, my God!

2329
03:25:27,740 --> 03:25:28,740
Oh, my God!

2330
03:25:29,800 --> 03:25:30,160
Oh, my God!

2331
03:25:30,420 --> 03:25:30,740
Oh, my God!

2332
03:25:30,741 --> 03:25:30,800
Oh, my God!

2333
03:25:30,900 --> 03:25:31,420
Oh, my God!

2334
03:25:31,421 --> 03:25:31,980
Oh, my God!

2335
03:25:31,981 --> 03:25:32,981
Oh, my God!

2336
03:26:56,700 --> 03:26:57,700
It's amazing!

2337
03:28:32,020 --> 03:32:12,360
I can smell the sweat.

2338
03:32:22,460 --> 03:33:58,920
It's coming out!

2339
03:34:10,050 --> 03:34:12,150
Wow! It's coming out!

2340
03:34:12,151 --> 03:34:13,231
Wow! It's coming out a lot!

2341
03:35:00,740 --> 03:35:01,520
Oh, no!

2342
