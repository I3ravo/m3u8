1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,040
The food was delicious, wasn't it?

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
Yes, it was good.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,560
Yes, even the dessert was delicious.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,200
What's the matter? Why don't you sit down?

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,200
Ah...

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,960
You look a little strange today.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
Do I? Yes, you look.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,360
..

9
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,361
What?

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,310
Do you have something to say?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,240
No, I don't have anything to say.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,740
Thank you so much for today.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,360
You checked out my shop.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,120
No, it's nothing.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,460
It's all for you.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,920
I can't get used to your suit.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,860
It's cool and nice.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,760
Really?

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,380
Yes.

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,050
It's fresh and nice.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,700
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,880


23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,000
The suit is fresh and nice.

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,640
Is it?

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,600
Yes, it looks good on you.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,600
I made it for today.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,530
Is that so?

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,340
But I don't usually wear it.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,900
It's nice to wear a suit once in a while.

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
I think so.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,820
But it's a little tight.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,780
What is this?

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Please marry me.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,730
Yes.

35
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
Are you sure? I'm so happy.

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540


37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,090
How do I look? You look good.

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,230


39
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,490
Do I? It's perfect.

40
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,811
It's just the two
of us, isn't it?

41
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,050
Yes.

42
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm glad.

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,950
Actually, I wanted to
propose at a restaurant.

44
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,190
But I didn't know the timing.

45
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm not used to it.

46
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,330
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,670
Thank you. I'm so happy.

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,210
Thank you.

49
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,380
I wish you happiness.

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,720
I wish you happiness.

51
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:07,721
I'll do it.

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Oh, right.

53
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,420
I have to give you a wedding.

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,641
You said you wanted to do it.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,560
It was my dream to give you a wedding.

56
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,100
Then, let's make it a little flashy.

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,820
There are a lot of people.

58
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:40,580
It doesn't have to be that big, but if you
can wear a wedding dress, that's enough.

59
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,640
I have to go and choose a lot of things.

60
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,560
I've always wanted to wear a wedding dress.

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,681
One day I want to show my
husband a beautiful wedding dress.

62
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,180
But in order to do that,
I have to throw it away.

63
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,880
No, not at all.

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,340
I don't know why, but I'm a
little worried about your belly.

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,871
It's embarrassing,
isn't it? No, it's not.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000


67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,060
What?

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
You have a good body.

69
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,371
It's not like that at all.

70
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,200
No, it's not.

71
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
Is that so? I'm sorry.

72
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,010
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,300
I promised I wouldn't do
that until we got married.

74
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,780
I promised, but I'm fine today.

75
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:32,060
No, you can't.
You have to keep your promise.

76
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:42,240
And you should keep your promise
and do it after you get married.

77
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,100
So, you are looking forward to it
until we get married, right? Yes, I am.

78
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,200


79
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,600
Thank you for taking care of me, Ryota.

80
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,580
I love you.

81
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,120
I love you more.

82
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,860
No, I don't.

83
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,760
But I have to go to say
hello to Kana's father.

84
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,100
It's all right.

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
No, no, no.

86
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,300
Kana's father is scary.

87
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,340
It's all right. He's not that scary.

88
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,020
That's only for Kana.

89
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,021
It's just you, isn't it?

90
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,980
If a stranger like me went there,

91
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,580
I wonder what they would say.

92
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,380
I'm with you, too.

93
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
You'll be fine.

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Yeah.

95
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,120
I'm sure you'll get what you want.

96
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,690
I think I'll go home.

97
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,660
What?

98
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,400
You said you'd go with me.

99
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Yeah.

100
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Well, I know.

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400


102
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,260
I came all the way here.

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
This is the menu.

104
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,620
It's written in various languages.

105
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes.

106
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,690
It's great.

107
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,250
Excuse me.

108
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,810
Yes.

109
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,910
Excuse me.

110
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,090
Hello.

111
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:41,710
Hello.

112
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,290
I'm Chibuna, and I'm in charge of today.

113
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,330
Nice to meet you.

114
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,410
Nice to meet you.

115
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm Miyashita.

116
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,450
Nice to meet you.

117
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,770
Nice to meet you.

118
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,580
Are you planning to have a
wedding with Estee Lauder? Yes, I am.

119
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860


120
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,760
I proposed to her the other day.

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,100
Thank you so much.

122
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,420
Does Estee Lauder go to your wedding often?

123
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,000
I've been there a few
times, but it's his first time.

124
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,440
Oh, it's his first time.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm a little nervous.

126
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm so nervous.

127
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Don't worry.

128
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,876
It's your first time to
wear a wedding dress.

129
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
You must be excited.

130
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Yes.

131
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,900
I want to look beautiful
when I wear a wedding dress.

132
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,020
Have you decided the dress yet?

133
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,380
I'm going to decide it soon.

134
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,210
I'm looking forward to it.

135
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
Me, too.

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,360
Are you the type to decide
it right before the wedding?

137
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Yes.

138
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,320
I'd like to do a lot of things together.

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm excited.

140
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,480
I've done a lot of things for the first
time, so I'm excited about a lot of things.

141
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm excited.

142
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
That's right.

143
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
Today, do you have a 90-minute
body care course? Yes, it's okay.

144
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,860


145
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,980
I'd like to have a drink
before the operation.

146
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,716
I've been drinking it for a while,
but if you don't mind, I'd like to try it.

147
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,420
Oh, then I'll try it.

148
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,340
Thank you.

149
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
I'll pour it for you.

150
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Thank you.

151
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,540
This drink has a high metabolism
and improves your immunity.

152
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Oh, I see.

153
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
It's original.

154
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,680
Is there a place to put it out?

155
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,800
There may be quite a few.

156
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,820
How long have you been dating?

157
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,101
How long have you been
together? About 3 years.

158
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,280


159
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,980
It's like a proposal on an anniversary.

160
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,180
Yes, it is.

161
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,740
How did you start dating?

162
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,780
Originally, our parents were good friends.

163
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,120
We knew each other from childhood.

164
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:11,840
It's a little hard to
understand, isn't it? Yes, it is.

165
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,780


166
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,360
If you get married, you'll get along
with your family, won't you? That's right.

167
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,860


168
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,580
I'm looking forward to it.

169
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,140
I'll go get ready, too.

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,820
Yes.

171
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,420
Please wait a moment.

172
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,421
Please come in.

173
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
You are very polite.

174
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,156
It seems to be a good shop.

175
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,540
Really?

176
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,320
Yes.

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,080
I see.

178
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,260
If you say so, there is no doubt.

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm looking forward to what
kind of surgery you will have.

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,220
I wonder what kind of surgery I will have.

181
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,221
I wonder if I can do it.

182
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,990
You know, about female estheticians,

183
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,940
there was a very beautiful woman.

184
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,590
What?

185
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,610
Come on, Ryota-kun.

186
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,650
No, no, no.

187
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,210
Why are you looking at me?

188
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,530
No, that's not what I mean.

189
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:42,370
Excuse me.

190
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,990
Excuse me.

191
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,210
Thank you for waiting.

192
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,770
This is the original
herb tea from our store.

193
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,000
It has a relaxing effect and a
blood flow improvement effect,

194
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,740
It has a good effect on the
kidneys, so it's good for the kidneys.

195
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,910
Thank you.

196
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,830
Let's eat.

197
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,910
It's good, isn't it?

198
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,740
I don't usually drink herbal tea.

199
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,610
Is it better to drink it all?

200
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:19,626
Is it better to eat it
like this? That's right.

201
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,650
It's delicious.

202
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:28,650


203
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,340
I feel like my body is getting warmer.

204
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,000
I feel the same way.

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Do you?

206
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,580
I feel like I'm getting taller.

207
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
That's amazing.

208
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,560
Wow, that's amazing.

209
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,120
Since you have a chance, I
would like to invite you, Ms. Ryota.

210
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,300
Oh, this way, please.

211
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Here it is.

212
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,510
Thank you very much.

213
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,511
Are you from
Hiroshima? Yes, I am.

214
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,730


215
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,470
What's the matter?

216
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,790
He is a very nice person.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,160
But sometimes I feel like I
don't want to be with him.

218
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,610
Do you feel anxious?

219
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:51,490
I like it and I want to get
married, but I'm a little worried.

220
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,950
There are a lot of people who
have such worries before marriage.

221
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
I see.

222
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,990
It's called marriage blue.

223
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,950
Ah, marriage blue.

224
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,430
I'm not good at it.

225
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,510
I see.

226
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
But it's okay.

227
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,780
You'll be confident when you get beautiful.

228
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,260
When you get beautiful,
you'll be more slender.

229
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
I see.

230
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Let's get beautiful.

231
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,210
Yes. Thank you.

232
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
I'll do my best.

233
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Yes.

234
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you want to change your clothes?

235
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,820
Yes.

236
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,340
I'll show you around.

237
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Yes, please.

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,000
This way.

239
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Yes.

240
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,130
You look very nervous.

241
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,540
I'm nervous because it's my
first time to be an esthetician.

242
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,110
I can feel your nervousness.

243
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,170
Excuse me.

244
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,890
I'll show you around.

245
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,610
You changed your clothes, too.

246
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,550
Are you still nervous?

247
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,370
No, it's my first time.

248
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,210
You should relax.

249
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,470
OK.

250
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,150
Take your time.

251
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,530
See you later.

252
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,310
OK.

253
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:28,870
See you later.

254
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,090
This way, please.

255
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,930
Let's take a picture.

256
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:36,990
OK.

257
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,710
I've prepared extra pictures.

258
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,270
OK.

259
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,050
Do you have a couple
picture? No, I don't.

260
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,170


261
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,800
It might be difficult to see.

262
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,870
I see.

263
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,140
Could you please turn off the lights?

264
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,350
Shall we start the procedure?

265
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,710
Yes.

266
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,010
I'm going to touch your whole body.

267
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,030
Yes, please.

268
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,290
Thank you.

269
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you have any particular concern?

270
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:28,180
My waist, my legs, and my shoulders.

271
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,380
Your whole body?

272
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Yes.

273
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you work hard?

274
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:33,200
How do you feel?

275
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,120
I feel a little stiff.

276
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
I see.

277
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,516
Let's check your legs first.

278
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Okay.

279
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,800
Please tell me if it hurts.

280
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:45,200
Okay.

281
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,440
How is the pressure? Oh, great.

282
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540


283
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,940
It's just right.

284
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,310
Do you feel any
pressure? No, I don't.

285
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,910


286
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,350
Your body is getting warmer.

287
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:03,506
Your body is getting warm, isn't it?

288
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,810
Yes, it's quite warm.

289
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,970
It's the effect of the tea.

290
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,640
It's amazing. It's so quick-drying.

291
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes, it is.

292
00:18:29,340 --> 00:19:01,950
Does it tickle? A little.

293
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,910


294
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,630
Please bear with me because it
is easy to accumulate waste here.

295
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,300
Excuse me.

296
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
I'll put it on top.

297
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Okay.

298
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,240
Your shoulders are very stiff.

299
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,190
It hurts a little around here.

300
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,520
Are you okay?

301
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,480
Do you want me to
massage it? I'm okay.

302
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,760
Does it feel good?

303
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,190
Yes, it feels good.

304
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,030
I'm going to sit down
and give you a massage.

305
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,270
Can I sit down?

306
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,990
Yes.

307
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,550
Please make yourself comfortable.

308
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,980
Dresses are decorated.

309
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
That's right.

310
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,360
If there is a needle
here, I can't cut it cleanly.

311
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:34,220
Don't be nervous.

312
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

313
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,160
Ms.
Tachibana, you're very good at massaging.

314
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Oh, really?

315
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,960
I've never felt so good when
I've been massaging before.

316
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,000
It was a little painful.

317
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,940
I'm glad to hear that.

318
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,920
Since all the muscles here are connected,
can I massage the lower part of the bust?

319
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,170
Yes, please.

320
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,600
Can I take this off?
I'll massage from behind.

321
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,650
Excuse me.

322
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,720
Do you take off your clothes
when you take a bath? Yes, I do.

323
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,900


324
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,180
I'll try not to show you.

325
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,770
Please relax.

326
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,690
Thank you.

327
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,850
I'll start from your armpit.

328
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,310
Does it hurt? No, it's okay.

329
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,230
It feels good.

330
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:48,290
If you loosen this part, the
position of the bust will be higher.

331
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,370
Oh, I see.

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,290
But it's a little embarrassing.

333
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,450
It's okay because you can't see it.

334
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,470
We are both women.

335
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,920
Excuse me.

336
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,110
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,470
Are you all right?

338
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,370
Yes.

339
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,340
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:24,710
Don't worry about it.

341
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,550
I'm a little embarrassed because I'm hot.

342
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,290
It's okay. It's the effect of tea.

343
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,370
There is a hand in the middle.

344
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,670
I'm glad I have this.

345
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,270
It's a little embarrassing
to show this to you.

346
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,420
I've never shown you naked before.

347
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,460
I see.

348
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,520
Ahem.

349
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,620
It's over.

350
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:52,980
If I massage your back like this,

351
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,240
you will feel better.

352
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,280
Oh, I see.

353
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,040
I'll give you a massage.

354
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:18,080
Can you stand up?

355
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,441
Is it okay if I massage your head?

356
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Yes.

357
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:34,440
It's a little embarrassing.

358
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
It's okay.

359
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,440
Is it okay if I use a little more force?

360
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,660
Yes.

361
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
It's more effective if
you massage with force.

362
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,500
I see.

363
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,390
It feels good here,
doesn't it? Yes, it does.

364
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,730


365
00:29:52,830 --> 00:30:10,850
Can I make it a little
stronger? Yes, please.

366
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,610


367
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,820
Are you okay? Yes, thank you.

368
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,260


369
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,470
It's a good reaction,
isn't it? I'm sorry.

370
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,830
It's okay.

371
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,710


372
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,450
It's a proof that it works.

373
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,451
That's right.

374
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Hey, Kana-san.

375
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,210
Yes?

376
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,470
Do you want to feel better?

377
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,030
Yes.

378
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,610
Then I'll put a little more effort into it.

379
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,290
Please do.

380
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,190
Please wait a moment.

381
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,010
Yes.

382
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,460
Yes. What's wrong with me?

383
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Do you feel good?

384
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Yes.

385
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,140
Excuse me.

386
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,400
Yes.

387
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Please answer me.

388
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,710
Excuse me.

389
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,330
Yes.

390
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,820
I heard that you want to
be stimulated more strongly.

391
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,570
Is there any problem if
you change to a man?

392
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:47,630
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

393
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,570


394
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,670
Well, this is what you are
doing, so please relax and enjoy.

395
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,750
Yes, I understand.

396
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,410
I'm going to start.

397
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,930
Please.

398
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,990
I'm going to start from the back.

399
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,750
I'm going to start from the front.

400
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,170
Yes.

401
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,170
Please relax.

402
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,210
I can't see from here, so please relax.

403
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:32,670
Are you okay? I'm okay.

404
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,950


405
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,610
You have a stiff neck.

406
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,810
Is that so?

407
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,560
Your body is shaking.
Are you okay? I'm okay.

408
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,600


409
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm going to apply it.

410
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:03,115
What's the
matter? It's a little.

411
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,570
..

412
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,790
It's easy to get a lump here, too.

413
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,270
Women's fingers can't
be stimulated completely.

414
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,740
It's better to stimulate it properly.

415
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:37,506
It also has the effect of boosting up.

416
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,370
I see.

417
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,371
Oh, I see.

418
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,460
Can you open your
eyes like this? Yes, I can.

419
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,710


420
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,400
At first, you may feel
a little embarrassed,

421
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,221
but when you go home,
you will be satisfied.

422
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,770
I see.

423
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,040
So, please relax and open your eyes.

424
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,890
Yes.

425
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,530
How about this? It's a lot.

426
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,740


427
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,920
I've done a lot.

428
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,500
You've done a lot, so
I'll give you a little more.

429
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,780
I'll put on some oil to
make it more effective.

430
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,100
Yes.

431
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,120
Excuse me. Could you check the temperature?

432
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay.

433
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,960
Excuse me.

434
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,050
Excuse me, too.

435
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,440


436
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,860
Yes.

437
00:37:48,390 --> 00:38:01,860
Please let me know if it hurts.

438
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Okay.

439
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,860
Is it okay if I put
pressure on you? I'm okay.

440
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,100


441
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:26,570
It seems to be accumulated.

442
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,850
Is that so?

443
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:51,510
I'm going to speed up a little.

444
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:36,980
Do you see the needle coming out a little?

445
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,010
Did it come out? It's effective.

446
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,660
I'll continue.

447
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,250
Okay.

448
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,130


449
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,510
I think it's good for the abdomen.

450
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:02,865
Excuse me.

451
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,010
Okay.

452
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,170
Please open your legs.

453
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,771
This lymph is also easy to accumulate.

454
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,440
I want you to be in a position
where you can flow the lymph.

455
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,429
I would like you to
be in a position that is

456
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,181
easy to flow, so can
you stand up a little?

457
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,970
It's okay if you put your weight on it.

458
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,690
If you hold it down by yourself, it
will be much easier to get the effect.

459
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,010
Is this the position?

460
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,930
How is it?

461
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,891
You have a lot of acupuncture points.

462
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,390
I would like you to stimulate
this part of your nose.

463
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,570
Is that okay?

464
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,650
Yes.

465
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,660
I'll add more acupuncture points here.

466
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,240
Okay.

467
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Excuse me.

468
00:41:47,025 --> 00:42:13,580
Is the pressure okay? I'm fine.

469
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,820


470
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,100
Are you okay? Yes, I'm sorry.

471
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,720


472
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,510
Can I continue? Please.

473
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,290
All right.

474
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,090


475
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,331
I'll stimulate you at the same time.

476
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,300
Excuse me.

477
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:54,200
It seems that you need a man's
strength, so I will replace you.

478
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,240
Oh, well, I'm in charge
of women's shoulders.

479
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,500
Don't worry about it.

480
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,280
Did you loosen your
back a lot? Well, yes.

481
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,460
It looks good.

482
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,380
I see.

483
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:15,381


484
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,040
Then, please face up.

485
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,460
Face up?

486
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,340
Yes.

487
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Okay.

488
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm going to use the oil.

489
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,260
Okay.

490
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,190
Okay.

491
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:46,470
Okay.

492
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,471
Is the temperature okay?

493
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,450
Yes.

494
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,950
I'm sorry.

495
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,590
Are you nervous? Yes, I am.

496
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:21,170
I didn't think I would
be kissed by a woman.

497
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,370
It's okay.

498
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,150
Please relax.

499
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,930
Okay.

500
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,800
Excuse me.

501
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:39,150
I'm going to massage your lymph nodes.

502
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,030
Does it hurt? No, it doesn't.

503
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,110


504
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,570
Does it feel good?

505
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,690
Yes, it feels good.

506
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,300
Oh, Ryota-san.

507
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

508
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,291
It's all right.
It's just a physiological phenomenon.

509
00:48:32,065 --> 00:49:36,000
But...

510
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,320
I have to loosen here, too.

511
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,100
It's okay.

512
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,540
Please relax.

513
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,120
It's okay.

514
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:26,730
Wait a minute.

515
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,250
Excuse me.

516
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,650
Wait a minute.

517
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,210
I'll massage this side as well.

518
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,670
Are you okay?

519
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:12,810
I have a headache.

520
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,550
Please stop.

521
00:51:31,365 --> 00:51:36,860
It's okay.

522
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,860
Don't be patient.

523
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,160
Please wait.

524
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
How do you feel? It hurts.

525
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280


526
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,120
Do you want me to press harder?

527
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:53,881
Do you want to go? Do you
want to go faster? I'm going.

528
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,720


529
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,080
Of course, I'll keep it a secret from you.

530
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,020
It feels good, doesn't it?

531
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,030
This bandage is a magic mirror.

532
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,130
If you remove this bandage,

533
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,550
you can see the surgery of Kana.

534
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,130
Do you want to remove it?

535
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:01,131
Do you want to see it?

536
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:02,490
What?

537
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,670
Do you want to see it?

538
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,540
No.

539
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:49,950
What should I do?

540
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:58,530
Kanan-sama wanted you to change into a man.

541
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,310
What?

542
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,470
You understand, right?

543
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,850
No...

544
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,550
What do you mean? I'll continue.

545
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,290


546
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:39,470
Please concentrate on this side, too.

547
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,830
No...

548
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,990
It's already like this.

549
00:54:46,570 --> 00:55:56,660
Do you see it? Here.

550
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,140
Now, I'm going to put this on you.

551
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:29,000
Did you put it on well?

552
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Look, Kana-san seems
to be feeling it a lot.

553
00:58:06,560 --> 00:59:04,970
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a thing.

554
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:06,371
You're going to have a stomachache.

555
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,310
You've had such a good meal.

556
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,710
Did you become like this
because you ate so much?

557
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,350
You're going to have a stomachache.

558
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,841
She is having a lymphatic stimulation.

559
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:51,850
You have a weird look.

560
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:56,760
Can you look in the
mirror? No, I can't.

561
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,650


562
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,990
Can you see yourself in the mirror?

563
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,670
I'm embarrassed.

564
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,190
It's okay.

565
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,870
I'm sorry.

566
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,560
Wait a minute.

567
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:16,360
Are you so worried
about him? No, that's.

568
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,700
..

569
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:30,760
I'm having so much fun
in a place you don't know.

570
01:02:30,761 --> 01:02:32,420
It's okay.

571
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:50,750
It's okay to sweat a little.

572
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:29,010
I'm just doing the same thing.

573
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:30,011
I'm just doing it.

574
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:46,820
Kana, I'm just being forced to do it.

575
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,100
Do you really want to check it out?

576
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,560
What do you mean?

577
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,540
Kana, how do you feel?

578
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,480
It was delicious.

579
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,100
You wanted it for a long time, didn't you?

580
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:26,631
You don't have to think about it.

581
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:41,900
You've been holding it in for a
long time, haven't you? I'm so sorry.

582
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,070


583
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,860
I've been whining a lot.

584
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,520
Can I do it alone?

585
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,630
How do you feel?

586
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:25,770
I see that you are excited to
hear other people's whining.

587
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,690
You are also excited, aren't you?

588
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,470
No, no, no, please stop.

589
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,110
How do you feel?

590
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,710
Are you more excited than usual?

591
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,630
No, no, no, I don't know.

592
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:57,250
We promised not to do
that until we get married.

593
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,090
Is that so?

594
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,290
Of course, you're going to get a headache.

595
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:32,430
Let's do it.

596
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,800
We'll do it.

597
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,360
Because you're eating so much.

598
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:32,470
Hello everyone, this is Natchi♡

599
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,431
Let's start from the back of your head.

600
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:49,890
Your neck is very soft.

601
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,750
It's good.

602
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:09,730
※This is not a sound effect.

603
01:10:09,731 --> 01:10:09,930
※This is not a sound effect.

604
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:31,590
One, two, three, four...

605
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:56,660
Five, six, seven...
Eight, nine, ten...

606
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,060
I'll stimulate with this.

607
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

608
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,131
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

609
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:29,280
Please don't do that.

610
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:30,281
Please.

611
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:51,640
You're enjoying it, aren't you?

612
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,800
You're drooling.

613
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:22,910
Let's enjoy it, too.

614
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:34,710
Are you okay? Let me play with you.

615
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,110
You want to sleep, don't you?

616
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,711
You haven't slept for
a long time, have you?

617
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,820
Let's sleep comfortably.

618
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:54,740
【The sound of Kana's stomach, 】

619
01:13:57,190 --> 01:14:06,020
Hmm, let's do it.

620
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,100
Kana, what are you feeling?

621
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:35,380
I haven't done it for a long
time, so I'll go right away.

622
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,920
Let's do the same thing.

623
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:29,380
It's going to break.

624
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:30,381
I'll do it.

625
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:35,600
Don't speak.

626
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,120
Ready?

627
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,640
It's getting more and more fun.

628
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,470
Please be honest with yourself.

629
01:19:45,835 --> 01:19:59,800
You wanted to do this, didn't you?

630
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,120
I'll give you a lot.

631
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,820
Do you feel good? I'm sorry.

632
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:15,821
I'm sorry.

633
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,620


634
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:42,900
Your nose is amazing.

635
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,761
You are moving by yourself.

636
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,700
How do you feel?

637
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,190
Your back is moving.

638
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:46,620
Can you stand up?

639
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:47,621
Can you see this?

640
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,450
This also has a great effect.

641
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:35,160
Please look at the camera.

642
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,940
Do you feel good?

643
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,720
Do you feel good? I'm sorry.

644
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,780
I'm sorry.

645
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,420
I'm sorry.

646
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,070


647
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,110
You're beautiful.

648
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,330
Yes.

649
01:24:49,950 --> 01:25:00,390
Are you okay?

650
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:03,870
Can you lie down?

651
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:27,300
I'll put you on the bed.

652
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:36,580
Excuse me.

653
01:26:12,260 --> 01:27:05,680
Can I put you on the bed?

654
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,760
Are you having so much fun?

655
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:15,920
I hope you have a lot of fun, too.

656
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,660
It feels good, doesn't it?

657
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,100
What do you think
of me? I feel sick.

658
01:28:23,435 --> 01:29:19,640


659
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,320
I'm doing the same thing.

660
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:26,920
I feel sick.

661
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:55,450
Yeah, this is also a rule, isn't it?

662
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,900
Are you going to sleep?

663
01:31:39,250 --> 01:32:52,100
It's about time.

664
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:58,260
Are you satisfied?

665
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,520
【Mai】

666
01:33:21,260 --> 01:34:13,040
【Dad】 【Dad】 【Yuki】

667
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:24,720
【Dad】

668
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,950
I'm going to take a shower.

669
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:35,750
I'm going to take a shower.

670
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:39,010
Do you want to feel better?

671
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:47,310
You want to feel better,
don't you? Be honest.

672
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:53,070


673
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:32,480
What do you want
me to do? Like before.

674
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:41,630


675
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:14,790
It's better than taking a
shower, isn't it? It's very hard.

676
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,250


677
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:53,480
Please pinch my boobs more.

678
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:53,740
Really?

679
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,440
For example, like this.

680
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:00,870
Oh, it feels good.

681
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:22,870
It's a little harder.

682
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:32,650
It feels good.

683
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,250
Really?

684
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,620
Oh...

685
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,170
Doesn't it feel better now?

686
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,840
Oh...

687
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:23,811
Oh... Oh...

688
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:34,990
Please enjoy the sound of my teeth.

689
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:39,110
I think it's better if you
put your tongue out more.

690
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,660
It's getting better.

691
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:01,460
It feels good.

692
01:39:01,461 --> 01:39:02,461
It hurts, baby.

693
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,060
This side, too.

694
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:29,710
I'm going to do something
you've never done before.

695
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:42,830
What is it? I can't.

696
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:09,490


697
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:11,840
If you can't, I'm going to stop.

698
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,680
I'm going to stop.

699
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,260
Please don't stop.

700
01:40:18,261 --> 01:40:19,261
Please forgive me.

701
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,140
I understand.

702
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:52,340
What's wrong? I feel good.

703
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:56,580


704
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,960
Do you feel good?

705
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,840
I feel good when I scratch my neck.

706
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,160
That's good.

707
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,740
ーWhat kind of feeling is this?ー

708
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:54,140
This is my favorite part of my body.

709
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,260
Oh, I see.

710
01:42:03,995 --> 01:42:04,995
What's wrong?

711
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:11,070
I've been dumped.

712
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,920
What do you mean?

713
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:25,110
It's a little rough and sensitive.

714
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,550
It's time to eat it.

715
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:55,560
What's wrong? Your body is stiff.

716
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:05,500
I was touched like this and it feels good.

717
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,401
You wanted to feel good, didn't you?

718
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:21,200
Wow, your stomach is beating.

719
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,820
Kana-san, you have a
little bit of tape on your face.

720
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,640
I'm sorry.

721
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,300
It's a good thing.

722
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:11,700
I can't stand it.

723
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,460
You can't stand it?

724
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,680
Give me the tape.

725
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,520
Where? In the bag.

726
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:50,890


727
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:54,150
Give me the tape.

728
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:55,260
Please help me.

729
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:56,710
I understand.

730
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:00,630
What position do you want me to put you in?

731
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:42,000
How do you feel?

732
01:45:45,175 --> 01:45:47,120
Please don't bully me.

733
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,480
I'll put you in if you
tell me the truth again.

734
01:45:51,481 --> 01:45:52,540
I will put it in the box.

735
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:09,250
Please put the baby in the box from behind.

736
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,640
Then, please stick out your butt.

737
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,980
Do you understand? It's coming in.

738
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:50,120
Are you satisfied with half of
your body when you grow up?

739
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:58,420
You have grown up a lot.

740
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:02,820
Do you feel any pain?

741
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,200
I'm going to go there soon.

742
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:40,420
What's wrong?

743
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:41,980
You are going there soon.

744
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:49,380
You were feeling good, weren't you?

745
01:48:51,955 --> 01:49:19,940
You are taking a rest.

746
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:22,830
You are taking a rest.

747
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:48,420
I'm going there soon.

748
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:24,850
It hurts.

749
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,260
It hurts, doesn't it?

750
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:36,640
Do you want to stop if it doesn't work?

751
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:51,861
Have you ever done it by force like this?

752
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:07,830
Let's put it in.

753
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:10,270
I'll put your right foot in.

754
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:21,270
Ah!

755
01:51:21,930 --> 01:51:22,930
I!

756
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:26,741
C... Ah!

757
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,360
How do you feel? It's.

758
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:29,780
..

759
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:34,820
it's hard to breathe...
I can't breathe...

760
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:55,390
It's so hard...

761
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,280
It hurts, doesn't it?

762
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:09,000
I...

763
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:13,560
Can you do this

764
01:52:13,735 --> 01:52:14,920
while RUTO-san is there?

765
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,120
How...

766
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,660
Will you sleep with me until I get married?

767
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,020
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

768
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,920


769
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,690
You can sleep more.

770
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:51,360
I'll give you more.

771
01:53:14,575 --> 01:53:33,390
What's wrong?

772
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:15,970
How do you feel? I'm so sorry.

773
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,470
I feel so bad.

774
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:09,610
I'm sorry.

775
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:32,140
You are hitting your butt.

776
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:34,760
I'm sorry.

777
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:49,140
I'm sorry.

778
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,320
I'm sorry.

779
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,920
I'm sorry.

780
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,360
I'm sorry.

781
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:05,020
Sigh...

782
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:30,740
Are you coming to
see me again? I will.

783
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:40,820


784
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:56,780
What?

785
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,860
Aren't you going to change?

786
01:57:59,861 --> 01:58:00,861
You don't like it?

787
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:07,850
Do you want me to show
you something interesting?

788
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:12,440
Something interesting?

789
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,660
What?

790
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,800
What?

791
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:35,940
He wants to be petted.

792
01:58:35,941 --> 01:58:36,941
It's annoying.

793
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:03,680
You were doing like this in the bathroom.

794
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:11,260
Now, Kana-san is tired.

795
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:14,440
Yes, I'm tired.

796
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:20,660
Are you okay,
Ryota-san? At this rate.

797
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:24,320
..

798
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:47,980
Oh, Ryota-san...

799
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:59,840
I'm sorry.

800
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,420
You've been holding back.

801
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:18,380
You've been holding
back, haven't you? I'm sorry.

802
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:22,360
I'm so sorry.

803
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,540
Please forgive me.

804
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:33,920
Oh, it's so hot.

805
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:05,500
I can't believe that you're here!

806
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:10,280
It was great to see you!

807
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,880
I'm so happy to see you!

808
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:27,740
I'm so happy to see you!

809
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:43,100
、、、

810
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,240
、、、

811
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,820
Are you done? Yes, I am.

812
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:19,160


813
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,740
I am so glad you are okay.

814
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:34,400
Your stomach is making me feel bad.

815
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:48,670
I am sorry.

816
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:50,690
I am so sorry.

817
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:50,890
I am so sorry.

818
02:02:50,891 --> 02:02:51,110
I am so sorry.

819
02:02:51,111 --> 02:02:52,111
I feel really good.

820
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:57,830
〔I'm so sorry.

821
02:02:57,831 --> 02:03:01,870
〕 〔Let me drink a lot of water.

822
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:28,000
〕 〔I'm so sorry.

823
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:33,300
〕 〔I'm so sorry.

824
02:03:33,301 --> 02:03:38,060
〕 Why did mom's face turn red?

825
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:42,220
Why did she turn pale all of a sudden?

826
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,620
Oh, it's so soft.

827
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:03,170
Oh, it feels so good.

828
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:07,770
I'm so sleepy.

829
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,550
I moved a lot.

830
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:38,540
I moved a lot.

831
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,340
I'm so happy.

832
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:45,000
I'm so happy.

833
02:05:45,001 --> 02:05:49,040
I'm so sleepy.

834
02:05:49,041 --> 02:06:06,500
I've never made you
cry, but you made me cry.

835
02:06:06,501 --> 02:06:07,501
Did you sleep
well? It feels good.

836
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:15,260
It's intense.

837
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:20,260


838
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:12,211
O挺我們 Our The

839
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:56,140
The

840
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,921
The The The The The Ooooooop!

841
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:17,620
Ooooooooop! Hahaha.

842
02:08:38,070 --> 02:08:46,280
That's so pervert to be
big chubby all the time.

843
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:51,390
Luuuuurp!

844
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:08,800
I can't believe I put in so much juice.

845
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,500
I'm sorry.

846
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:32,620
I watch the Youtube videos.

847
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:37,140
I eat green tea.

848
02:09:37,141 --> 02:09:37,240
I eat snack.

849
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:39,580
I have a girlfriend.

850
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:46,180
She is eating the noodles.

851
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:02,500
However, my girlfriend is
on the other side of the floor.

852
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,640
I watch the videos.

853
02:10:04,641 --> 02:10:06,200
I'm so nervous.

854
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:12,860
What kind of nerve do you
have, you pervert? I'm sorry.

855
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:17,440
She's.

856
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:17,820
..

857
02:10:17,821 --> 02:10:19,400
She's...

858
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:21,580
That's right.

859
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:24,020
It's her fault, isn't it?

860
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:25,600
Yes.

861
02:10:36,200 --> 02:11:10,350
Today, I'm going to show you how to
make the most delicious ramen in the world.

862
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:05,150
Oh, I'm so scared.

863
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:15,330
Oh, my stomach is growling.

864
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:19,770
Hey, what's going on, Kana-chan?

865
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:34,000
Mom, what do you want to do?

866
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:36,580
Mom, what do you want to do?

867
02:12:39,970 --> 02:12:40,720
What's wrong
with you? I'm sorry.

868
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:41,970
I'm sorry.

869
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:43,640
What's wrong
with you? I'm sorry.

870
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:51,640


871
02:12:52,490 --> 02:13:06,000
I should have brought you to the bathroom.

872
02:13:37,755 --> 02:13:39,310
My baby, how do you feel?

873
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:42,350
Do you feel good?

874
02:13:46,570 --> 02:13:47,790
I know you feel good.

875
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,750
I'm going to sleep.

876
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:32,190
I'm going to sleep.

877
02:15:27,370 --> 02:15:30,410
You were humming and when I

878
02:15:30,660 --> 02:15:53,950
You were humming and when I fell

879
02:15:55,210 --> 02:15:58,770
Kana-san, you were out
of breath, weren't you?

880
02:16:01,590 --> 02:16:04,950
Let me out of breath, too.

881
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:38,100
It feels good.

882
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:41,000
It's the best.

883
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:48,180
Oh, it's the best.

884
02:20:23,530 --> 02:20:26,030
Are you going to give me a massage?

885
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:58,020
Oh- Oh- Oh- Oh- A-

886
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:04,510
Oh-

887
02:23:08,385 --> 02:23:10,390
Oh- It's very good.

888
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:17,710


889
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:20,930
Oh-

890
02:23:21,430 --> 02:23:41,120
Oh- Oh- Oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh a 20 Yeah.

891
02:23:41,121 --> 02:23:42,840


892
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:31,730
Oh, it feels so good.

893
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:05,960
Ahhhh!

894
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:14,290
Oh!

895
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:15,620
Oh!

896
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:01,130
What's wrong?

897
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:03,660
Oh!

898
02:27:04,710 --> 02:27:05,070
Oh!

899
02:27:05,410 --> 02:27:06,090
Oh!

900
02:27:06,091 --> 02:27:06,490
Oh!

901
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:06,830
Oh!

902
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:07,970
Oh!

903
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:08,370
Oh!

904
02:27:08,371 --> 02:27:09,371
Oh!

905
02:27:09,690 --> 02:27:10,690
Oh!

906
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:13,670
Oh!

907
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:23,390
Oh, it feels good.

908
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:11,290
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

909
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:35,360
I am exhausted.

910
02:36:47,140 --> 02:37:08,480
Ah... ah... ah...vrooom...
Hey, I can hear you.

911
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:11,580
Touch my bean curds.

912
02:37:11,581 --> 02:37:14,120
Help me!

913
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:40,340
Oh my god! Oh, it's heavy.

914
02:37:51,830 --> 02:37:56,150


915
02:38:23,070 --> 02:38:47,340
Mr. Tachibana, will you go out with me?

916
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:49,720
What?

917
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:53,880
I don't want to.

918
02:38:55,100 --> 02:38:56,100
What?

919
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:58,220
Why?

920
02:38:59,250 --> 02:39:05,400
I have a girlfriend, but I can't go out
with someone who does such a thing.

921
02:39:05,550 --> 02:39:07,400
There is no reason to refuse.

922
02:39:09,190 --> 02:39:10,640
I refuse.

923
02:39:41,330 --> 02:39:43,570
Oh, my...

924
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:46,250
All right, all right.

925
02:40:29,570 --> 02:40:32,070
It's like...

926
02:40:32,730 --> 02:40:37,050
The staff is waiting for me here.
