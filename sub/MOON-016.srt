1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,860
Minami Riona in the middle of the night.

2
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:08,690
Minami-san, is it okay if we put
the cups together? Yes, it's okay.

3
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,450


4
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,670
It's for one person.

5
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,970
Yes, it's for one person.

6
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,430
It's for one person.

7
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,110
Welcome.

8
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:38,980
Then, this is for you.

9
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,320
Thank you.

10
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,680
That's all for today.

11
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,780
Thank you.

12
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,781
Thank you very much.

13
00:01:44,480 --> 00:02:58,330
It's rare.

14
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,730
It's a weekday.

15
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:10,070
I think it's going to run out.

16
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,690
Is it?

17
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,030
It's still fine.

18
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,650
I'll check it.

19
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,050
Please.

20
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,790
Minami-san.

21
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,190
Yes?

22
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:36,970
Did you drink the
new coffee? Yes, I did.

23
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,090


24
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
It smells so good.

25
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,090
Right?

26
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,550
I think I'm going to fall
in love with the coffee.

27
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,991
I think I'm going to fall in
love with the scent of the tree.

28
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,970
Didn't you say that when
you were a freshman?

29
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,570
Did I? Yes, you did.

30
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,630


31
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,710
It's been about a year since I came here.

32
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,850
Yes, it's been almost a year.

33
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,530
Time flies.

34
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,941
How long have you been here?

35
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,531
I've been working here
for about five years.

36
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,310
Five years? That's right.

37
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,670
I see.

38
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,390


39
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,950
It's easy to work here.

40
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,010
It's dark here.

41
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,391
I like this kind of atmosphere.

42
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,290
You're right.

43
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,490
By the way, what did you
say before? No, not really.

44
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,730


45
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,071
I just went out for a meal.

46
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm not good at snoring.

47
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,080
Minami, do you get along
with your boyfriend? Me? Well.

48
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440


49
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,720
..

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
I guess so.

51
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,570
What do you mean?

52
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Did something happen?

53
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:34,760
What would you like
to drink? Excuse me.

54
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,480


55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes?

56
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,040
I'd like to order watermelon.

57
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,600
Do you have any recommendation?

58
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Recommendation?

59
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,680
How would you like to drink?

60
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm a little tired, so I'd like to
drink something refreshing.

61
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,920
I'd like to drink herbal tea.

62
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,160
What kind of herbal tea do you have?

63
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:03,540
What do you want to drink?

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,300
I want to drink chamomile,
jasmine, and hibiscus.

65
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,280
Do you want to drink rooibos tea?

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,780
Yes, I want to drink rooibos tea.

67
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,520
It was a good night.

68
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
Did you sleep well? Yes, I did.

69
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,360


70
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,200
By the way, the resort
was closed, wasn't it?

71
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Yes.

72
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,991
If you get tired, you
should go to bed early.

73
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,360
It's hard to go back to the temple early.

74
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,900
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

75
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,636
It's a little dark. I'll turn on the light.

76
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,710
I'm sleepy.

77
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,010
I'll turn off the light and go to bed.

78
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,180
Are you going to sleep?

79
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:27,960
Yes.

80
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:28,961
I'm sorry.

81
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:33,900
I'm a little dizzy.

82
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Do you want some
salt? No, thank you.

83
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480


84
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,350
I like bright places.

85
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,600
I see.

86
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,560
But last time, I heard what you
said and turned off the light for you.

87
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,210
I know.

88
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:05,430
But you said you were sleepy.

89
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,790
Okay, I got it.

90
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:18,980
Like this? More.

91
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760


92
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
More?

93
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,280
Like this?

94
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,550
Is it too dark?

95
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,150
A little?

96
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,310
How about this?

97
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,450
Do you want to fix it?

98
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,451
Are you okay?

99
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,150
You have a stiff neck.

100
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,250
Don't say that.

101
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,070
How long are you going to be shy?

102
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,930
Can I lick you? It tickles.

103
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,460


104
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,360
You are very cute.

105
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
You have a nice tongue.

106
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,690
Your head is wet.

107
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:19,920
I can't see anything.

108
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:56,800
Can I take off your blanket?

109
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
I want to see you more.

110
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I don't want to see you.

111
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
You don't want to see me?

112
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,650
No.

113
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I feel good.

114
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,820
I feel so good.

115
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I'm going to cry.

116
00:18:22,240 --> 00:19:02,890
I'm going to cry.

117
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,051
Can I take a shower with you?

118
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,310
Yes.

119
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,290
It felt good.

120
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:39,130
Thank you.

121
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,170
Do you want to take a
shower with me? No, I'm fine.

122
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,850


123
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,330
Are you sure?

124
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,230
I'm going to take a shower.

125
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,270
Yes.

126
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,350
Good night.

127
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,790
Good night.

128
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,550
Good morning.

129
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,330
Good morning.

130
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:45,930
You're early.

131
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,470
Yes, I am.

132
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
It's going to rain today.

133
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,070
Really?

134
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,210
I didn't bring an umbrella.

135
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,211
I'm home.

136
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm sure you'll be home soon.

137
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,750
I'm going to use the bathroom.

138
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,210
What's wrong?

139
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,190
You don't look well.

140
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,930
Really?

141
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,470
I'm not good at it.

142
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
What's wrong?

143
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,090
Can you say it?

144
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,150
I can say it, but...

145
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,070
I recently broke up with my boyfriend.

146
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,910
Really?

147
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:25,911
Are you sure?

148
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,670
Have you heard the reason?

149
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,870
Personality is important.

150
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,610
I see.

151
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Well, I'm sure.

152
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,240
Then, let's have a drink today.

153
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Yes, please.

154
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,490
How can I help you?

155
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,050
I'd like to pay by smart phone.

156
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,770
Then, please pay by this card.

157
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,130
Here you are.

158
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,530
Thank you.

159
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,670
Do you need a
receipt? No, thank you.

160
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,270
Thank you.

161
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,770
Thank you.

162
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,380
Thank you.

163
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000


164
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,390
I had a hard time today.

165
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,010
Me, too.

166
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,550
Shall I clean up? Yes, please.

167
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,250
Yes, please.

168
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,510
Good morning.

169
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:13,910
Good morning.

170
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,430


171
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,150
Did you order the new
tea from Kyoto? Yes, I did.

172
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,730


173
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,770
But maybe I should wait a little longer.

174
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,210
Maybe it's not enough.

175
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,550
That's not good.

176
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,310
I'll ask tomorrow.

177
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,210
Please.

178
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,190
What are you looking at?

179
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,410
I'm looking at my friend's
touring week next week.

180
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,810
Do you have a driver's license?

181
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,370
Yes.

182
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,750
I didn't know that.

183
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,990
Didn't I tell you? I don't know.

184
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,670
I have it.

185
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,050
That's great.

186
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,130


187
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,330
When can you get
it? On my day off.

188
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
That's great.

189
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990


190
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,790
Do you have a driver's license?

191
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,890
I only have a car license.

192
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,470
Are you going to drive?

193
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,050
I'm going to drive.

194
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,390
It's been a long time since I last drove.

195
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,670
I want to go swimming.

196
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,750
Are you interested?

197
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,830
Yes.

198
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,220
I want to ride a car behind you.

199
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,290
No problem.

200
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,870
Really?

201
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,710
Are you worried about my driving?

202
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,110
I'm a little scared.

203
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,380
What's going on? I don't know.

204
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800


205
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,870
Should I go to the breaker?

206
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,110
Yes, you should.

207
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,900
I'll go to the breaker.

208
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,710
Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine.

209
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,500


210
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,720
Please wait a moment.

211
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,830
Thank you.

212
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
How was it?

213
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,950
I called the management company,

214
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,790
but it seems that all
the buildings are closed.

215
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,710
It seems that it will take
some time to reopen.

216
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,690
I'm glad it's still open.

217
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,600
I think it's good to be
open during business hours.

218
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,100
Isn't it a little too dark?

219
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,820
Oh, is this okay?

220
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,116
I found it in the storeroom
when I saw the breaker.

221
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,060
Yes, it's very helpful. Thank you.

222
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,380
Can you go? Yes, I can.

223
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740


224
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,750
I didn't know such a thing existed.

225
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,810
It's my first time, too.

226
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,660
Do you want me to turn off
your smartphone? No, it's okay.

227
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,820


228
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:50,590
When it's dark, you can
see the other person's face.

229
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,830
I don't think I need to see your face.

230
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,820
It's embarrassing, so please don't.

231
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,770
I'm sorry.

232
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,850
Don't apologize like that.

233
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,970
I'm not serious.

234
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,950
Really?

235
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:36,325
I don't feel anything at all.

236
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,440
I see.

237
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,050
Do you want to talk about something?

238
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
Talk?

239
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Yes.

240
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,300
Do you want to talk about something?

241
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Me?

242
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:15,930
Let's start with the theme of love.

243
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,770
Love?

244
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,010
Yes.

245
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,990
What do you think, Minami?

246
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,270
I...

247
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
How about this?

248
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,020
What do you mean?

249
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:17,720
I don't hate it at all, but I also
like this kind of atmosphere.

250
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
I see.

251
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,660
Do you like to do it in the dark?

252
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,620
What do you mean? Matching.

253
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,480


254
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,300
Matching?

255
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I don't hate it.

256
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:11,921
I don't mean that.

257
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:33,905
I like the dark side.

258
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,760
Is that so?

259
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,100
I told you that I broke
up with my boyfriend.

260
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,300
I mean, my ex-boyfriend.

261
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,352
The reason why we broke
up was that my ex-boyfriend

262
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:12,300
liked to turn on the light
and do it in a bright place.

263
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,830
Then we gradually broke up
because we didn't get along.

264
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,740
I broke up with my boyfriend.

265
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,130
Is that so?

266
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,510
Yes.

267
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:44,770
I asked him why he wanted
to do it in such a bright place.

268
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,890
I see.

269
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,330
Then,

270
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,290
he said,

271
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,650
all AVs are shot in bright places.

272
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,650
I don't know why.

273
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,270
He said,

274
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,090
all AVs are shot in bright places.

275
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,070
I see.

276
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,970
I prefer dark places.

277
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:16,990
I like dark places.

278
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,500
Me, too.

279
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,160
I sometimes watch porn.

280
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,560
I wonder if it's not embarrassing
to do it in a bright place.

281
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,160
I think so, too.

282
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:43,360
I think it's better to be dark.

283
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,780
I'm sorry. I look like a fool.

284
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,330
No, not at all.

285
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,160
Here...

286
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,730
What do you mean?

287
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,510
Like this? It's so weird.

288
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,430
Sorry.

289
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800


290
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,520
Please don't apologize.

291
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,630
I'm sorry, too.

292
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,080
I didn't expect you to come here.

293
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,390
I know.

294
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,300
Well, let's get ready to go home.

295
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Yes.

296
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Well,

297
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,900
I know I'm late today, but...

298
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
It's okay.

299
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,350
Please.

300
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,120
I'll give it back to you.

301
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

302
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,410
It's okay.

303
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:57,405
What do you want to eat?

304
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,630
How about meat?

305
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,260
How about steak? I'll treat you.

306
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
No, thanks.

307
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,730


308
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,490
How about hamburger?
Sounds good.

309
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,890


310
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,550
I'd like to have a drink, too.

311
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,170
A drink? I know a good
place that serves good Jibiru.

312
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,750
Really? Let's go there.

313
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:24,730
Yes, let's.

314
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:25,130
Is it close? Yes, it is.

315
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,810
Let's go.

316
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,850


317
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,110
This way?

318
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,770
Jibiru? That's nice.

319
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,740
How was Jibiru?

320
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,920
I might have drunk too much.

321
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,895
Are you all right?

322
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,731
I think I'm a little sick.

323
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,880
There's a park. Do you want to sit down?

324
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Yeah, I want to take a break.

325
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,300
Do you want to come
closer? Let's do that.

326
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600


327
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,500
I drank too much.

328
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:28,060
I'm sorry.

329
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:30,900
Are you all right?

330
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,140
Yes, I feel better after a little rest.

331
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,760
That's good.

332
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,891
By the way, you drink a lot, don't you?

333
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,020
I used to be a bartender before this job.

334
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,100
Is that so?

335
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,780
You should have told me that earlier.

336
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,640
I'm sorry. I didn't ask you.

337
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:15,680
The moon is beautiful,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

338
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,680


339
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:37,330
Hey, do you want to kiss me?

340
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,630
Are you still drunk? A little.

341
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,170


342
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,801
You're living on your own, aren't you?

343
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,950
Well, a little bit.

344
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,250
That's enough.

345
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,560
It's bright here.

346
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,280
I think it's darker.

347
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,150
Let's go to a darker place.

348
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,270
Where? I don't know.

349
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,300


350
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,620
Shall we go?

351
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,760
Yes.

352
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,350
Are you okay? Can
you walk? I can walk.

353
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,830


354
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,770
I'm a little dizzy, though.

355
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:13,990
Shall we take a
nap? No, I'm fine.

356
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,510
I can walk.

357
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,370
But I might still be a little dizzy.

358
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,591
I don't know if I can do it.

359
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,790
I don't think it's a hot spot.

360
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,930
Please support me.

361
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,670
The shower was narrow,
but it was beautiful.

362
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:37,180
Yes, it was.

363
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
I finally cooled down.

364
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,460
Yes, you did.

365
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:43,620
I want to drink sake.

366
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,640
You should have bought it on the way.

367
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,200
But I'm fine.

368
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,610
I'm nervous.

369
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:26,910
Do you want to take a shower?

370
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,870
Then, you go first.

371
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,110
Isn't it too dark?

372
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,660
It was a little bright.

373
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,550
I think this is better.

374
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,620
Do you want to make it a little darker?

375
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,700
I want to make it darker.

376
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,380
It's dark.

377
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,440
Let's get started.

378
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,190
I'm embarrassed.

379
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,220
I'm glad you feel something.

380
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,750
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

381
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,240
I can't see you.

382
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
You smell good.

383
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:56,690
I'm sorry.

384
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,190
I'm sorry.

385
01:02:37,630 --> 01:03:07,990
I'm embarrassed to say this.

386
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:59,290
Mom, who's been living with me for
ten years, has already passed away.

387
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:01,651
I'm going to take a break
from childbirth because I'm sick.

388
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:15,850
Are you okay? It's a mess.

389
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,510


390
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:08,640
She is a mother of three.

391
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,460
Her name is Kako.

392
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,580
She is a mother of two.

393
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,820
Her name is Furuko.

394
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:51,160
She is a mother of two.

395
01:16:50,220 --> 01:17:02,460
This is the first time I've had a baby, so
I'm a little nervous, but I'll do my best.

396
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,690
I'm going to start with a massage.

397
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,150
I'm going to start with a massage.

398
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,490
I'm going to start with a massage.

399
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,880
I'm sorry.

400
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,210
I'm sorry.

401
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:19,030
Oh my god!

402
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,680
Oh my god!

403
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:30,740
Oh my god!

404
01:20:30,741 --> 01:20:31,741
How do you feel?

405
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:52,130
Oh my god!

406
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:00,550
Oh, it feels so good.

407
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:51,340
Good girl.

408
01:23:02,740 --> 01:27:35,710
Here we go.

409
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:09,600
I'm a little shy, but I'm still using it.

410
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:10,601
Thank you.

411
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:23,300
Thank you.

412
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Thank you.

413
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:51,930
I hope you get along
with each other better.

414
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,440
It's good to use the voice.

415
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,200
I'm still a little shy.

416
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I'm shy.

417
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:38,350
Why don't we take a bath together?

418
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:43,240
I don't mind if it's dark.

419
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:50,870
Let's do that.

420
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:59,410
It's cute.

421
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,870
Are you all right? Be careful.

422
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:09,790
I'm scared.

423
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:10,930
Midnight.

424
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:48,320


425
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:50,610
Riona Minami

426
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:28,470
It was a little darker, wasn't it?

427
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:38,040
I was in a bad mood at that time.

428
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,660
Why?

429
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:56,110
I thought I was doing something I
shouldn't do because it was a shop.

430
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:58,950
I'm going to put a towel under the bed.

431
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,210
I'm going to put a towel under the bed.

432
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,280
It's OK.

433
01:42:17,490 --> 01:45:08,690
I'm going to put a towel under the bed.

434
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:44,210
This is a video of a baby who was
born in a cage and tried to escape.

435
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,011
This is a video of a baby who was
born in a cage and tried to escape.

436
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:53,970
This video is a video of
the birth of a new baby.

437
01:56:41,620 --> 01:57:18,280
I am a mother of three.

438
01:57:43,520 --> 01:58:26,140
I am a mother of five.

439
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:34,750
I'm full.

440
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:43,500
I'm full.

441
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:56,300
By the way,

442
02:00:58,050 --> 02:01:01,340
next Wednesday is off, isn't it?

443
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,460
I'm off tomorrow morning.

444
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:09,040
I'll be there in the evening.

445
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,980
Let's have dinner together again.

446
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,160
OK.

447
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:51,940
You're late.

448
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:53,940
I'm sorry.

449
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:55,260
Not at all.

450
02:01:55,261 --> 02:01:58,300
It's not like I invited you.

451
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:01,560
It's fun.

452
02:02:02,335 --> 02:02:06,220
Yes, it's fun for me, too.

453
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:10,140
It feels good, doesn't it?
The wind outside.

454
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:21,510
It's beautiful.

455
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:24,610
I'm glad you like it.

456
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:27,610
You like it, don't you?

457
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:28,970
Yes.

458
02:02:29,970 --> 02:02:33,180
You're biting too much.

459
02:02:35,395 --> 02:02:37,700
I want to drink more.

460
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,280
Which one is the
best? I want this.

461
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:45,440
Oh, good.

462
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:47,870


463
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:50,960
Do you want this?

464
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:53,340
Can I have it?

465
02:02:55,190 --> 02:02:56,190
Can I have it?

466
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:05,810
My body is a little hot.

467
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:10,430
I drank a lot.

468
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:15,310
Thank you.

469
02:03:26,130 --> 02:03:27,720
Isn't it good? It's good.

470
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000


471
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,681
It has a strong lemon flavor.

472
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:35,000
Today's pizza was really good.

473
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,460
It was good, wasn't it?

474
02:03:37,230 --> 02:03:38,300
There were so many kinds.

475
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,600
I want to try this one.

476
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,760
It was quite big and I was surprised.

477
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:46,720
I was surprised, but I could eat it.

478
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:52,931
There is a pizza with cheese.

479
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:56,470
It looks like quattro con macchi.

480
02:03:57,550 --> 02:03:59,470
I want to try that.

481
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:02,710
Let's go there next time.

482
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,890
There were a lot of pasta, too.

483
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:14,821
If there are so many
kinds of pasta, I will laugh.

484
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:20,290
By the way, I heard that
you have a room for a party.

485
02:04:21,970 --> 02:04:22,970
Don't you have a
job? I have a room.

486
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:24,970


487
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:26,090
Really?

488
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:26,430
Yes.

489
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:28,170
I'm glad to hear that.

490
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:29,690
You must be busy.

491
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:36,510
I have a day off tomorrow.

492
02:04:36,511 --> 02:04:37,511
Good night.

493
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:41,530
Do I have to do a lot
of things for you? Soon.

494
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,280


495
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:58,100
Do you want to take a shower?

496
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:03,780
I don't have to take a shower today.

497
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,400
Really?

498
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:08,630
You are sweating a lot.

499
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:13,120
Then, I'll take a shower.

500
02:05:15,735 --> 02:05:16,735
I'm going to take a bath.

501
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:20,260
I'm going to take a bath.

502
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:25,960
You don't have to take a bath.

503
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:31,930
Really?

504
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:36,431
You don't have to take a bath.

505
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,160
I see.

506
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:03,930
It's getting dark.

507
02:06:05,290 --> 02:06:06,290
With this? I'm nervous.

508
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,320
Ah, my body.

509
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:16,080


510
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:23,240
I told you that I did my
hair, but I'm quite drunk.

511
02:06:34,030 --> 02:07:01,860
Oh, really? I'm drunk.

512
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:05,420


513
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,321
、。。 、。。

514
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:40,840
、。。

515
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:32,140
、。。

516
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:01,660
You have a cute voice.

517
02:17:29,060 --> 02:17:30,060
Thank you.

518
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,200
I'm happy.

519
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:23,798
This is the first time I've had a
baby, and it's been a while since

520
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:26,550
I've had a baby, so I'm a little
nervous, but I'm sure I'll be fine.

521
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:36,720
I'm sure I'll be fine.

522
02:19:38,130 --> 02:19:59,640
I'm sure I'll be fine.

523
02:19:59,641 --> 02:19:59,700
I'm so sorry.

524
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:01,220
Really? I can't do it.

525
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:13,140


526
02:20:56,140 --> 02:21:00,250
Are you OK?

527
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:01,251
Are you okay? I'm okay.

528
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:02,450


529
02:21:02,925 --> 02:21:04,410
I'll do it slowly.

530
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:32,740
I can't do it.

531
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:49,960
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

532
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:53,320
I'm sorry.

533
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,420
It's hot.

534
02:22:44,830 --> 02:22:45,830
It's hot.

535
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:47,350
It's hot.

536
02:22:48,970 --> 02:22:59,360
How about this? No, but.

537
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:07,360
..

538
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:10,840
I can do it.

539
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:12,680
Just wear it as it is.

540
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:14,880
As it is.

541
02:24:35,170 --> 02:24:36,270
I'm sweating.

542
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:39,190
It's hot.

543
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:44,630
It's hot.

544
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:45,770
It's hot.

545
02:24:45,771 --> 02:24:50,030
No, it's not.

546
02:24:51,970 --> 02:25:09,300
I feel sick.

547
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:17,840
It's hot.

548
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:34,730
※I'm sorry.

549
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:37,430
It's disgusting.

550
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,050
It's disgusting.

551
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:44,790
It's disgusting.

552
02:25:54,050 --> 02:25:57,110
Oh my god!

553
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:59,950
I love you! I feel sick.

554
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:08,590


555
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:46,640
It's hitting my stomach.

556
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:10,720
Me, too.

557
02:27:14,670 --> 02:27:18,960
It's totally different.

558
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:28,220
This might be bad.

559
02:28:01,230 --> 02:28:02,710
I'm sorry.

560
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,590
What should I do?

561
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:22,590
What should I do?

562
02:29:57,330 --> 02:29:58,330
I can't help but cry.

563
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:35,980
I can't help but cry.

564
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:43,900
It hurts, it hurts,
it hurts!! It's gone.

565
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:44,960
It's gone.

566
02:31:46,400 --> 02:32:03,400
It's gone.

567
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:49,340


568
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:41,230
This is the first time
I've ever seen a baby cry.

569
02:33:41,231 --> 02:33:42,351
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

570
02:33:43,870 --> 02:33:45,270
It's embarrassing.

571
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:50,830
It's different from when I was born.

572
02:35:52,730 --> 02:35:54,010
It's different.

573
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:06,100
I have a bad feeling about this.

574
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:40,160
I'm going to sleep.

575
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:40,360
You're going to fall asleep.

576
02:37:40,361 --> 02:37:42,041
It looks like you're going to fall asleep.

577
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:47,880
I'm going to fall asleep.

578
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:50,140
Where?

579
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:54,900
You don't have to do anything.

580
02:37:55,720 --> 02:38:02,280
You don't have to do anything.

581
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:05,280
You don't have to do anything.

582
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:14,980
You don't have to do anything.

583
02:38:15,330 --> 02:38:16,060
Oh, it's hot.

584
02:38:16,165 --> 02:38:17,640
Give it to me.

585
02:38:53,170 --> 02:38:55,100
It's wet.

586
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:37,560
I feel so good.

587
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,440
Me, too.

588
02:40:03,150 --> 02:40:08,100
I'm so sleepy.

589
02:41:06,380 --> 02:41:07,460
I'm going to take a shower.

590
02:43:09,450 --> 02:43:12,320
I'm going to take a shower and go home.

591
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:28,980
But it's bright.

592
02:43:31,785 --> 02:43:42,950
It's bright, but it's so dark that I
think it's okay not to turn on the light.

593
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:48,900
Really?

594
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,120
It's not a bad idea.

595
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,320
It's so beautiful.

596
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:30,400
Don't say that.

597
02:44:33,680 --> 02:45:06,410
It's so good.

598
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:31,560
It's hard.

599
02:46:31,561 --> 02:46:32,561
Let me see your face.

600
02:47:09,330 --> 02:47:13,330
It's very hard.

601
02:47:15,010 --> 02:48:53,140
It's too hard.

602
02:49:45,940 --> 02:49:52,540
Don't read it.

603
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:53,720
I have a weak heart.

604
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:00,580
I don't want to read it.

605
02:50:04,580 --> 02:50:05,580
I have a weak heart.

606
02:50:13,220 --> 02:50:15,800
I want you to know that.

607
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:02,640
My son is having a hard time.

608
02:52:02,641 --> 02:52:03,641
I'm worried about him.

609
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:13,170
I'm worried about him.

610
02:52:17,410 --> 02:52:19,110
I'm worried about him.

611
02:52:51,780 --> 02:52:58,130
I'm so happy to see you, dad.

612
02:52:58,131 --> 02:53:01,930
How do you feel? I feel so good.

613
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:07,900


614
02:53:13,030 --> 02:53:14,380
I'm so happy to see you, dad.

615
02:53:15,860 --> 02:53:30,900
Oh, my gosh.

616
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:16,320
I have never seen such a cute child before.

617
02:57:37,570 --> 02:57:38,570
In your mouth.

618
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:46,540
Are you okay? You look fine.

619
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:11,080


620
02:58:29,390 --> 02:58:30,950
What? Why are you crying? Cute.

621
02:58:32,650 --> 02:58:33,650
Cute.

622
02:58:35,530 --> 02:58:36,530


623
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:52,940
Please take your time.

624
02:58:53,940 --> 02:58:55,260
I'm going to take a shower first.

625
02:58:58,540 --> 02:59:01,660
If you feel like it, please come with me.

626
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:05,060
It's okay if it's dark.

627
02:59:05,061 --> 02:59:06,061
I don't mind.

628
02:59:44,390 --> 02:59:46,790
Can you close the curtains?

629
03:00:05,990 --> 03:00:07,590
Can you do that again? Sure.

630
03:00:08,510 --> 03:00:09,510
What? Good job.

631
03:00:12,690 --> 03:00:13,690


632
03:00:56,500 --> 03:01:26,960
You were busy today
as well, weren't you?

633
03:01:28,445 --> 03:01:31,580
Oh, did you drink the new black
tea that came out the other day?

634
03:01:33,130 --> 03:01:33,900
It was really good.

635
03:01:33,901 --> 03:01:34,901
It was really fun.

636
03:01:41,190 --> 03:01:42,190
Hey,

637
03:01:43,950 --> 03:01:44,950
you know,

638
03:01:45,630 --> 03:01:47,310
we played in a bright place the other day.

639
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:52,030
It felt really good,

640
03:01:52,495 --> 03:01:57,230
but I thought it would be
better to do it in a dark place.

641
03:02:00,330 --> 03:02:01,330
You know,

642
03:02:02,250 --> 03:02:03,250
when it's dark,

643
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:05,290
you can feel that part a lot.

644
03:02:05,291 --> 03:02:12,810
I'm a shy person, so I think it's
better to have sex in a dark place.

645
03:02:24,520 --> 03:02:29,810
I'm going to have sex here again.

646
03:02:45,995 --> 03:02:47,635
I'm going to do a lot of exciting things.

647
03:02:50,360 --> 03:02:51,870
Come here.

648
03:02:53,690 --> 03:02:55,950
Come here.

649
03:02:57,635 --> 03:02:58,670
Come here.
