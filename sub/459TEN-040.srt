1
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,860
I'm nervous.

2
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm nervous.

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,620
I smell good.

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,580
Don't be nervous.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,560
Don't be nervous.

6
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:37,690
Open your mouth.

7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,820
I'll show you a lot of kisses.

8
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:41,680
I'll show you a lot of kisses.

9
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,766
I'll show you a lot of kisses.

10
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:49,560
How do you feel?

11
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:52,080
It's messy.

12
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,830
I'm nervous.

13
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm nervous.

14
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:04,070
I'm nervous.

15
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm nervous.

16
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,620
I'm nervous.

17
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,710
I'm nervous.

18
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,320
How do you feel?

19
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,860
I'm nervous.

20
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,630
I feel good.

21
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,000
How do you feel?

22
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,540
I want water.

23
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,590
I'm nervous.

24
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
How do you feel?

25
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,490
I feel good.

26
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,740
I'm nervous.

27
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:23,530
It hurts.

28
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:21,070
I'll make you feel better.

29
00:23:31,610 --> 00:24:53,940
How do you feel?

30
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,220
How do you feel?

31
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,030
How do you feel?

32
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,670
I'm nervous.

33
00:27:19,865 --> 00:28:16,410
I'm nervous.

34
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:10,060
I'm nervous.

35
00:35:15,810 --> 00:36:19,660
I'm nervous.

36
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:54,570
I'm nervous.

37
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,750
I'm nervous.

38
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:34,410
I'm nervous.

39
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,520
I'm nervous.

40
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,910
Open your mouth.

41
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,790
I'll show you a lot of kisses.

42
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,110
I'll show you a lot of kisses.

43
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:49,770
Open your mouth.

44
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,320
I'm nervous.

45
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,440
How do you feel?

46
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,040
I feel good.

47
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,480
I'll make you feel better.

48
00:51:52,020 --> 00:52:46,280
I feel good.

49
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
How do you feel?

50
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,660
I feel good.

51
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,080
How do you feel?

52
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,790
I'm nervous.

53
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:04,530
It hurts.

54
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:05,531
It hurts.

55
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:30,230
How do you feel?

56
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:50,280
I'm nervous.

57
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:14,280
How do you feel?

58
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:31,570
I'm nervous.

59
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,080
I'm nervous.

60
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:33,110
I'm nervous.

61
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:35,650
I'm nervous.

62
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:25,620
How do you feel?

63
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:45,900
I'm nervous.

64
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:33,800
I'm nervous.

65
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:48,910
How do you feel?

66
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:49,911
You're cute.

67
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,330
I'm not good at being photogenic.

68
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,400
Are you popular?

69
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,110
I'm not sure.

70
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,970
I'm not unpopular.

71
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,550
I can make anyone fall for me.

72
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:11,650
Really?

73
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:12,970
That's amazing.

74
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:19,290
I'm conscious of a good body touch.

75
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,550
I see.

76
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,090
What do you do?

77
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:26,550
What do you think I am?

78
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:28,555
I can't guess.

79
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,270
Are you a college student?

80
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,370
I'm not a college student.

81
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,010
I'm an expert.

82
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:36,011
I'm an expert.

83
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,130
No one has ever guessed this.

84
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,070
What is it?

85
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,130
Are you an expert?

86
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,750
Are you an esthetician?

87
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,650
I'm called an esthetician.

88
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:52,630
No, I'm not.

89
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,470
You're not fashionable?

90
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,710
No, I'm not.

91
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:57,711
Are you a nurse?

92
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,490
Are you a nurse?

93
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:01,910
No.

94
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:03,870
I'm a chef.

95
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:05,870
Are you a chef?

96
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,750
That's cool.

97
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:10,990
That's unexpected.

98
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,130
What kind of chef are you?

99
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,250
I'm a French chef.

100
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:18,770
That's cool.

101
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,550
It must be hard to be a French chef.

102
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,450
It's hard.

103
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,610
It's been four or five years.

104
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,590
I can't handle fire.

105
01:11:29,591 --> 01:11:30,930
I can't handle a frying pan.

106
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,430
Is that so?

107
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:33,710
I'm still a beginner.

108
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,250
I can only do chores.

109
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:39,110
I'm a chef, but I don't cook.

110
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,390
Do you cook for your boyfriend?

111
01:11:45,355 --> 01:11:46,355
I often make oyakodon.

112
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:48,810
That's Japanese.

113
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,490
I usually cook at home.

114
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,330
Why did you decide to do AV?

115
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,340
It's very simple.

116
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:06,830
I like having sex.

117
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,770
I can't do it if I don't do it every day.

118
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,070
Do you actually do it?

119
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:15,610
Actually?

120
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:20,130
I don't have a boyfriend every day.

121
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,090
I do it a lot.

122
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,710
With whom?

123
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:26,711
I'm a chef.

124
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,870
I'm a chef.

125
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:32,550
What's the most perverted
sex you've ever had?

126
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:36,730
The most perverted sex?

127
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,150
Yes.

128
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:42,190
I think it's a man and a woman.

129
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:44,190
A man and a woman?

130
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,630
A man and a woman.

131
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:47,990
In love.

132
01:12:48,815 --> 01:12:50,830
I drink a lot.

133
01:12:50,831 --> 01:12:51,430
I cook a lot.

134
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:55,890
I do it alternately.

135
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,250
Three girls?

136
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,190
Three girls and three boys.

137
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,130
How was it?

138
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:07,310
It was great.

139
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,830
It was so much fun.

140
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,190
I want to do it right now.

141
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:15,231
I want to do it right now.

142
01:13:16,775 --> 01:13:18,110
I see.

143
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:19,790
That's good.

144
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,230
You like to be perverted.

145
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,550
I like it a lot.

146
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,630
What's your weapon?

147
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,510
My butt.

148
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:31,490
What?

149
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:32,590
My butt.

150
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,830
My butt is very big.

151
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:38,820
I'm a little complex.

152
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:40,770
Let me see.

153
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,810
It's good.

154
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,010
It's a tea bag.

155
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:45,490
Isn't it big?

156
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:47,420
It's good.

157
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:49,930
It's iron.

158
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:50,970
Do people praise you?

159
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,990
Yes, they do.

160
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,730
They say it feels good.

161
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,710
I'm good at moving my tongue.

162
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,270
Try it.

163
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,550
It's fast.

164
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:06,810
It's fast.

165
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,530
It's fast.

166
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,720
It's fast.

167
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,380
I move my tongue while I'm perverted.

168
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,500
You have big boobs, don't you?

169
01:14:27,545 --> 01:14:28,545
Do I have big boobs?

170
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Yes, you do.

171
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,740
What size is it?

172
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:35,400
It's B.

173
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,300
Can I see it?

174
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:43,220
I'm holding it.

175
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,100
It's okay.

176
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,750
Wait a minute.

177
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,500
It's erotic.

178
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,340
It's an erotic bra.

179
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,540
I like purple.

180
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,380
It's cute.

181
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,480
It's like a lace.

182
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,540
It's like a nipple.

183
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,740
Here?

184
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,220
It's embarrassing to
show it through the screen.

185
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,160
Why?

186
01:15:24,161 --> 01:15:25,161
It's good.

187
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,140
I want to be excited.

188
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:38,040
How do you feel?

189
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:47,671
How do you feel about your nipples?

190
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,730
Do you feel good?

191
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:49,910
I feel good.

192
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:52,690
I feel good.

193
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,840
It's an erotic bra.

194
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:56,650
Can I see it closer?

195
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,850
It's an erotic bra that doesn't come out.

196
01:15:59,851 --> 01:15:59,950
It's an erotic bra.

197
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:04,890
Do you have nipples?

198
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:07,010
I have nipples.

199
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,610
How do you do it?

200
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,370
I'll use a microphone.

201
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:24,450
What's that?

202
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,890
It's a microphone.

203
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:30,850
It's an erotic bra.

204
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:43,930
I've never done this before.

205
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:58,910
I'll try it on you.

206
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,490
I'll try it on you.

207
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,491
I'll try it on you.

208
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:26,360
I want to have sex.

209
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,910
I can't.

210
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:48,150
I can't.

211
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:57,440
It hurts.

212
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,441
It hurts.

213
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,200
It feels good.

214
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:18,200
I'm sweating.

215
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,460
You said you wanted to have sex.

216
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:26,330
I want to have sex.

217
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,780
It's time to have sex.

218
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,540
It feels good.

219
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,640
I want to have sex.

220
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,100
I'm getting excited.

221
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:05,410
I don't like it if you're not excited.

222
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,360
I think I'm too excited.

223
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,420
I don't like it if you're not excited.

224
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,020
You're wearing pajamas.

225
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:15,240
I'm nervous.

226
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,160
Are you nervous?

227
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:16,860
I'm nervous.

228
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:17,000
I'm nervous.

229
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,160
I don't know.

230
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,280
When I go to a club.

231
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,180
Do you go to a club?

232
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,440
I go to a club.

233
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,380
I fell in love at once.

234
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,440
I went to a club about two years ago.

235
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,660
Really?

236
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,880
What club did you go to?

237
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,620
YARIMOKU.

238
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,900
Did you pick up girls?

239
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,640
I was waiting for it.

240
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,080
I was waiting for it.

241
01:20:56,081 --> 01:20:56,180
I was waiting for it.

242
01:20:56,181 --> 01:20:59,360
If you sit and talk to me.

243
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,960
If you say you would drink.

244
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,740
I'm going to invite you.

245
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,540
Are you going to your hotel?

246
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:15,720
Oh, I see.

247
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:17,300
There's also the other way around.

248
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,360
Oh, really?

249
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,480
Do you talk to him?

250
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,340
Yeah, I do.

251
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,720
If I think he's good-looking,
I go talk to him.

252
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,600
I sit next to him or lean on him.

253
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,600
But you said there's
no man you can't talk to.

254
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,740
I usually lean next to
the man I'm talking to.

255
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,040
Oh, really?

256
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400
Like this.

257
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,860
Oh, I see.

258
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,220
You shouldn't be doing that.

259
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,280
Yeah, like this.

260
01:21:42,281 --> 01:21:43,320
This is how you do it.

261
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,640
Then I go like this.

262
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:50,720
Like this.

263
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,740
This is how you do it.

264
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,300
Yeah.

265
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,841
If I think he's good-looking, I
say, I'm going to the bathroom.

266
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,400
Oh, really?

267
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:01,860
You should do that.

268
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:05,140
This is a technique my friend taught me.

269
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:06,540
Oh, I see.

270
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:07,541
I see.

271
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,320
Do you ever feel like
you're not good enough?

272
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:13,290
Yeah, a lot.

273
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,400
Even if I ask him to exchange
LINE messages with me,

274
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:16,820
he won't do it.

275
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,140
Oh, really?

276
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,320
So you never see him again?

277
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,240
Yeah, even if I see him at a club.

278
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,600
If he's good, I'll text him,

279
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:28,580
but if he's not good, I won't text him.

280
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,280
Oh, really?

281
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:29,560
Yeah.

282
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,400
What do you mean by good?

283
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,401
What?

284
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,760
What do you mean by good?

285
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:36,960
Good?

286
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,040
What do you mean by good?

287
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,240
The way he moves his hips.

288
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,180
Oh, that?

289
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,840
It's not like he's good at kissing.

290
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:43,580
Oh, that too.

291
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

292
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
It's not like that?

293
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,200
That's true.

294
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,600
Oh, that's true.

295
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,900
But surprisingly,

296
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:52,540
there aren't many
people who do that for me.

297
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,300
Why?

298
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,500
There really aren't many.

299
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:55,980
What?

300
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,020
Men I see at clubs are
usually one-night stands.

301
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:02,400
That's what I think, too, so I
don't think you need to be so polite.

302
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:04,940
How do you do it?

303
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,660
Do you force it in?

304
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,960
How do you do it?

305
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,660
It's not polite.

306
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,360
Do you force it in?

307
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,600
Does it work?

308
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:14,680
It doesn't work.

309
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,060
It does.

310
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,220
It doesn't work.

311
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,480
Is it easy to kiss?

312
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,160
I might have said this on Zoom,

313
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,980
but kissing is a switch,

314
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,640
so you can kiss to get wet.

315
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,560
So it's okay.

316
01:23:27,561 --> 01:23:28,561
Just kissing?

317
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yeah.

318
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,720
You can get wet just by kissing?

319
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:33,280
You can get wet.

320
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,840
It depends on the time,

321
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,000
but you can get wet when you can.

322
01:23:38,001 --> 01:23:41,400
Do you ever fail at drinking?

323
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,820
I cry a lot.

324
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,420
I see.

325
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,060
You cry a lot?

326
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,440
I cry a lot.

327
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,520
Why?

328
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,120
When I'm waiting outside,

329
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,420
I don't cry when I'm drunk.

330
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,120
You cry a lot.

331
01:23:56,121 --> 01:23:57,760
I cry a lot.

332
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:58,760
I cry a lot.

333
01:23:58,761 --> 01:23:58,860
I cry a lot.

334
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,240
I cry a lot.

335
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:01,980
I cry a lot.

336
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,440
I have a failure.

337
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,240
What?

338
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,800
When I was in college,

339
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,440
I got drunk and cried a lot.

340
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,380
I see.

341
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,480
I didn't drink beer.

342
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,060
I see.

343
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,340
I see.

344
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:18,700
Do you usually do that?

345
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:19,701
Do you usually do that?

346
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,240
No, I drink beer now.

347
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,920
You drink beer now.

348
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:25,320
When I told my mom that I was pregnant,

349
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,740
she told me to drink after-beer.

350
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,180
Do you tell your mom that?

351
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,840
I tell her everything.

352
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,520
I tell her about men.

353
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,730
About sex?

354
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,800
Yeah.

355
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,300
My parents know what I do.

356
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,080
Do they?

357
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,300
Yeah.

358
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:44,340
I take them to my house.

359
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,000
What do they say?

360
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,940
I tell them to know about prostitution.

361
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,120
I see.

362
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,660
My mom might have been like that.

363
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:50,300
I see.

364
01:24:50,301 --> 01:24:50,340
I see.

365
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,050
My brother is like that.

366
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,820
He is very strict.

367
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,800
He takes me to a
different house every time.

368
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,120
He is a middle school student.

369
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,600
Are you okay with porn?

370
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,120
Yes.

371
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,300
Are you okay?

372
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,560
I'm a little scared.

373
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
That's why I'm nervous.

374
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,540
What about porn?

375
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,700
Did your parents tell you to do it?

376
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,340
No, they didn't.

377
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,440
They didn't?

378
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:14,420
Why?

379
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,920
You should tell them.

380
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,050
I can't tell them.

381
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:18,580
Why?

382
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:19,581
You should tell them.

383
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,116
I can tell them to play with me.

384
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,720
But I can't tell them to do it.

385
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,120
My parents might say that.

386
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:25,540
I see.

387
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,250
I'm a little weird.

388
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,860
They might get mad at me.

389
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:30,920
I see.

390
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,180
Before I applied for this job,

391
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,100
I was very worried about that.

392
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:37,320
What if my parents find out?

393
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,900
I see.

394
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,640
I'm still nervous.

395
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,820
You are.

396
01:25:41,821 --> 01:25:42,240
I'm nervous.

397
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,120
Really?

398
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,320
Yes.

399
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,460
You're lying.

400
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,280
I'm serious.

401
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,580
You're lying.

402
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,580
You need to drink more.

403
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,360
I'm okay.

404
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,680
I drank too much.

405
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:54,680
That eel?

406
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,800
Yes.

407
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,800
It's good.

408
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,060
What do you think?

409
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,440
It's good.

410
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,620
I like white.

411
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,200
White and gold.

412
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,600
White and gold.

413
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,760
This is a small area.

414
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,420
I was surprised.

415
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,270
I was surprised.

416
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,310
I like this style.

417
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,390
I'm going to push you.

418
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:46,030
I like the left one.

419
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,600
I want to have sex.

420
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,260
I'm going to push you.

421
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,440
What's the setting?

422
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:19,840
I don't know.

423
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,160
You don't know?

424
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,260
What kind of person is she?

425
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,140
I'm looking forward to meeting her.

426
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:31,220
I think it's good to drink this.

427
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:32,221
Really?

428
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,900
Let's go.

429
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:36,660
I have a request.

430
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,420
What is it?

431
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,400
I want a highball.

432
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,680
Okay.

433
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,820
I'm nervous.

434
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:44,780
Okay.

435
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,440
Are you that nervous?

436
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,870
I like alcohol.

437
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:00,930
I know.

438
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:03,590
But I only drink a highball.

439
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,890
Really?

440
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:06,290
You don't drink wine?

441
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:06,870
No.

442
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:08,050
I don't drink sour.

443
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:11,010
I only drink a highball.

444
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,460
How is your tongue?

445
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,220
My tongue?

446
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Isn't it dirty?

447
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:24,620
It's not dirty.

448
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:39,290
I want to have sex here.

449
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:40,770
Really?

450
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,210
I like blue.

451
01:28:42,211 --> 01:28:42,850
Really?

452
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:44,030
Are you excited?

453
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,230
I'm very excited.

454
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,070
I want to do it now.

455
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:47,230
There is no one here.

456
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,690
I want to do it at this timing.

457
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:50,460
Your tongue is dirty.

458
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,200
I want to have sex.

459
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:03,680
One more time.

460
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:08,120
What are you doing?

461
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,220
I want to have a soft kiss.

462
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,340
No.

463
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,640
Don't do that.

464
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:32,160
Turn off the light.

465
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,580
I want to have a soft kiss.

466
01:32:28,581 --> 01:32:29,581
Give me a pen.

467
01:32:54,450 --> 01:33:03,580
It's cool.

468
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,240
Turn off the light.

469
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,100
I want to have a soft kiss.

470
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,220
I want to have a soft kiss.

471
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,960
I want to have a soft kiss.

472
01:34:33,630 --> 01:35:10,280
I want to have a soft kiss.

473
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,530
Turn off the light.

474
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:28,930
I want to have a soft kiss.

475
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:37,950
I'm drunk.

476
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,080
I smell something.

477
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,580
Do you like it?

478
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,720
Yes.

479
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,380
Does it smell?

480
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,900
It doesn't smell.

481
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:03,920
Really?

482
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,320
Yes.

483
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,790
Look at my face.

484
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:43,450
It's cool.

485
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:46,130
I want to have a soft kiss.

486
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:48,990
It's cool.

487
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:03,270
I want to have a soft kiss.

488
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:30,660
I want to have a soft kiss.

489
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,020
Do you want to have a soft kiss?

490
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,760
You are cute.

491
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,720
You think I'm cute, don't you?

492
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,080
Don't do that.

493
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,200
I want to have a soft kiss.

494
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,120
It doesn't smell.

495
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:12,380
It doesn't smell, does it?

496
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:14,720
Everything smells good.

497
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:28,660
You are cute.

498
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:37,060
Does it feel good?

499
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,360
Yes.

500
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:49,840
Don't do that.

501
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,640
Don't do that.

502
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,040
Don't do that.

503
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:58,220
Don't do that.

504
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,860
Look at my butt.

505
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:25,230
My butt?

506
01:40:26,415 --> 01:40:27,920
Look at my butt.

507
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:28,320
What?

508
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,220
Look at my butt.

509
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,340
OK.

510
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,260
It stinks.

511
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,420
It stinks.

512
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,160
It's dark.

513
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:53,940
Does it smell?

514
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,500
Not at all.

515
01:40:58,100 --> 01:40:59,720
Make it smell more.

516
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:01,840
It doesn't smell.

517
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,120
Doesn't it smell?

518
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,080
Yes.

519
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:08,220
It smells, doesn't it?

520
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,380
It smells.

521
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:10,940
Say it again.

522
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,860
It smells.

523
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:18,620
Say it again.

524
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:20,880
It smells.

525
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,400
Say it again.

526
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,820
My butt stinks.

527
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,660
Look at my butt.

528
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:19,580
It smells.

529
01:42:19,581 --> 01:42:20,581
Look at my butt.

530
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:32,900
It feels good.

531
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:34,620
You are cute.

532
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,280
Let's have a soft kiss.

533
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:20,570
It smells.

534
01:43:20,571 --> 01:43:21,571
Look at my butt.

535
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,970
What?

536
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:23,150
My butt.

537
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:29,790
It smells.

538
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,570
It smells.

539
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:33,550
It smells.

540
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:40,670
It smells.

541
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,810
It feels good.

542
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:50,350
It feels good.

543
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:56,990
When you go to the bathroom,
please stop it with your tongue.

544
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:58,470
OK?

545
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:10,080
Look at my eyes.

546
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,780
It stinks.

547
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,040
Say that you like it.

548
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:18,440
What?

549
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,660
Say that you like it.

550
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:22,420
I'm scared.

551
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,880
I like it.

552
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:26,420
I like it.

553
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I like it.

554
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:53,500
Please ring the bell.

555
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:55,080
It hurts.

556
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,400
It hurts.

557
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:13,930
It hurts.

558
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:20,700
It hurts.

559
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,540
It hurts.

560
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:12,920
It feels good.

561
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:26,000
Let's put our shoulders out.

562
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:27,860
I don't know what you mean.

563
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,820
I'm nervous.

564
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,180
I'm nervous.

565
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,940
The scenery is good.

566
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,400
Really?

567
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:51,220
I didn't expect this kind of place.

568
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:52,820
I thought it was a club.

569
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:54,460
Really?

570
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,620
Well,

571
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:02,540
I can drink alcohol in this music video.

572
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:02,640
It's good.

573
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:04,460
I can drink alcohol.

574
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,540
Don't you usually drink?

575
01:47:06,885 --> 01:47:07,885
I don't care.

576
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,660
It's done.

577
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,000
Please stand up.

578
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:21,920
Come here.

579
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,880
I'm nervous.

580
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:40,160
I feel like I'm a girl.

581
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:42,820
Really?

582
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,140
Yes.

583
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,580
What are you doing?

584
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:48,700
There?

585
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,200
There?

586
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,440
Look at me.

587
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:25,500
I can hear footsteps.

588
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,270
It smells good.

589
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,750
I'm nervous.

590
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,330
Come here.

591
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:39,190
Please open the door.

592
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,600
This is the last one.

593
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:08,660
Can you do like Ijiri Okada?

594
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,140
To the camera?

595
01:49:16,905 --> 01:49:19,140
The high speed one.

596
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:21,780
That's right.

597
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:33,620
Thank you for watching!!
