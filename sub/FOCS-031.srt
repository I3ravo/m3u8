1
1.14 --> 9.18
 He's not coming.

2
9.18 --> 11.18
 Oh, there he is.

3
11.18 --> 12.18
 Hello.

4
12.18 --> 14.18
 Hello.

5
14.18 --> 15.18
 It's been a while.

6
15.18 --> 16.18
 It's been a while.

7
16.18 --> 19.18
 Yeah, it has.

8
19.18 --> 22.18
 We're in a different club.

9
22.18 --> 25.18
 He's the representative of the club.

10
25.18 --> 27.18
 And he's the vice-representative.

11
27.18 --> 28.18
 Hello.

12
28.18 --> 29.18
 Hello.

13
29.18 --> 31.18
 I'm Koizumi, the director of the music video.

14
31.18 --> 32.18
 Wow.

15
32.18 --> 33.18
 Are you serious?

16
33.18 --> 34.18
 Are you serious?

17
34.18 --> 35.18
 Wow.

18
35.18 --> 36.18
 Is it real?

19
36.18 --> 38.18
 What's your name?

20
38.18 --> 39.18
 I'm Shogo.

21
39.18 --> 40.18
 Mr. Shogo.

22
40.18 --> 41.18
 I'm the vice-representative.

23
41.18 --> 43.18
 My name is Moto.

24
43.18 --> 44.18
 Oh, Mr. Moto.

25
44.18 --> 45.18
 Mr. Shogo, Mr. Moto.

26
45.18 --> 46.18
 Yes.

27
46.18 --> 47.18
 I'm sorry.

28
47.18 --> 50.18
 I asked you to dance with me today.

29
50.18 --> 51.18
 Is it okay?

30
51.18 --> 52.18
 Yes, it's okay.

31
52.18 --> 53.18
 It's okay.

32
53.18 --> 54.18
 It's fun.

33
54.18 --> 55.18
 It's fine as long as it's fun.

34
55.18 --> 56.18
 It's like this.

35
56.18 --> 58.18
 It's fine as long as it's fun.

36
58.18 --> 59.18
 Today,

37
59.18 --> 60.18
 Yes.

38
60.18 --> 63.18
 You're popular because you're in a girl's club.

39
63.18 --> 64.18
 Today,

40
64.18 --> 65.18
 there's only one girl.

41
65.18 --> 66.18
 She's a new girl.

42
66.18 --> 67.18
 Oh, like the last time?

43
67.18 --> 68.18
 Yes.

44
68.18 --> 70.18
 Every club is doing the same thing.

45
70.18 --> 72.18
 That's right.

46
72.18 --> 73.18
 Because the kanji is the same.

47
73.18 --> 74.18
 It's not good.

48
74.18 --> 75.18
 It's not good.

49
75.18 --> 76.18
 It's not good.

50
77.18 --> 78.18
 So,

51
78.18 --> 80.18
 you're going to pick up a girl, right?

52
80.18 --> 81.18
 Yes.

53
81.18 --> 82.18
 That's right.

54
82.18 --> 83.18
 Since you're here by car,

55
83.18 --> 84.18
 let's go together.

56
84.18 --> 85.18
 Okay.

57
85.18 --> 86.18
 Let's go together.

58
86.18 --> 87.18
 Let's go together.

59
88.18 --> 94.72
 There she is.

60
94.72 --> 101.00
 Megu-chan.

61
101.00 --> 102.00
 Oh, Moto.

62
103.00 --> 104.00
 Wait a minute.

63
104.00 --> 106.00
 Why are you turning the camera?

64
106.00 --> 107.00
 Do you notice?

65
107.00 --> 108.00
 You notice, don't you?

66
108.00 --> 109.00
 I notice.

67
109.00 --> 110.00
 You notice, don't you?

68
110.00 --> 111.00
 What's wrong?

69
111.00 --> 112.00
 This is

70
113.00 --> 115.00
 for the record of the club.

71
116.00 --> 117.00
 Today?

72
117.00 --> 118.00
 That's right.

73
118.00 --> 119.00
 The director

74
119.00 --> 122.00
 wants you to pass by at the same time.

75
123.00 --> 125.00
 Who's the director?

76
125.00 --> 127.00
 The guy with the nickname.

77
127.00 --> 128.00
 Nickname?

78
128.00 --> 130.00
 There's a guy with a nickname.

79
130.00 --> 131.00
 I see.

80
132.00 --> 133.00
 I'll let you meet him later.

81
133.00 --> 134.00
 Okay.

82
134.00 --> 136.00
 He wants you to pick up a girl.

83
137.00 --> 138.00
 All of a sudden?

84
138.00 --> 139.00
 Not all of a sudden.

85
139.00 --> 140.00
 I've been waiting for you.

86
140.00 --> 141.00
 Oh, really?

87
141.00 --> 142.00
 I'm sorry.

88
142.00 --> 143.00
 It's okay.

89
143.00 --> 144.00
 Wasn't it hot?

90
144.00 --> 145.00
 No, it wasn't.

91
145.00 --> 146.00
 I see.

92
146.00 --> 148.00
 It's a little humid.

93
148.00 --> 149.00
 It's because of the shade.

94
149.00 --> 150.00
 Oh, I see.

95
150.00 --> 151.00
 It's because of the shade.

96
152.00 --> 154.00
 I've prepared a car.

97
154.00 --> 155.00
 Oh, really?

98
155.00 --> 157.00
 I'm going to move now.

99
157.00 --> 158.00
 Okay.

100
158.00 --> 159.00
 Let's go together by car.

101
159.00 --> 160.00
 Okay.

102
161.00 --> 163.00
 You're taking pictures all the time.

103
163.00 --> 164.00
 What?

104
164.00 --> 165.00
 You're taking pictures all the time.

105
165.00 --> 167.00
 I'm not used to taking pictures.

106
167.00 --> 168.00
 Oh, really?

107
168.00 --> 170.00
 If I walk too fast,

108
170.00 --> 172.00
 I can only see your back of the head.

109
172.00 --> 173.00
 Oh, really?

110
173.00 --> 174.00
 Aren't you bald?

111
174.00 --> 175.00
 I'm not bald.

112
175.00 --> 176.00
 No, I'm not.

113
176.00 --> 177.00
 I can't avoid it.

114
178.00 --> 179.00
 Stop it.

115
179.00 --> 181.00
 Actually, I'd like to be a signboard.

116
181.00 --> 182.00
 What?

117
182.00 --> 183.00
 No, no, no.

118
184.00 --> 185.00
 You're cute.

119
185.00 --> 186.00
 Thank you.

120
186.00 --> 187.00
 You're cute today, too.

121
187.00 --> 188.00
 Really?

122
189.00 --> 190.00
 Hey, open the signboard.

123
191.00 --> 192.00
 Signboard.

124
193.00 --> 194.00
 Nice to meet you.

125
195.00 --> 196.00
 Nice to meet you.

126
196.00 --> 197.00
 How do you feel?

127
197.00 --> 198.00
 I feel good.

128
198.00 --> 199.00
 Please come in.

129
199.00 --> 200.00
 Please come in.

130
200.00 --> 201.00
 Hello.

131
202.00 --> 203.00
 Hello.

132
203.00 --> 204.00
 The car is so cool.

133
204.00 --> 205.00
 It's cool.

134
206.00 --> 207.00
 Thank you.

135
208.00 --> 209.00
 Can I come in?

136
209.00 --> 210.00
 Sure.

137
210.00 --> 211.00
 I'll go this way.

138
212.00 --> 213.00
 It's a cool car.

139
213.00 --> 215.00
 I'll ride in it with you, so you can't take pictures.

140
215.00 --> 216.00
 Take a signboard.

141
216.00 --> 217.00
 Stop it.

142
217.00 --> 218.00
 Come on in.

143
218.00 --> 220.00
 Why am I always in the cart?

144
222.00 --> 224.00
 Can everyone take a picture with you?

145
224.00 --> 225.00
 Yes.

146
227.00 --> 228.00
 I'm A-chan.

147
234.00 --> 235.00
 I'm A-chan.

148
235.00 --> 237.00
 Nice to meet you.

149
237.00 --> 239.00
 He's the director of this program.

150
239.00 --> 241.00
 You're the same director.

151
241.00 --> 243.00
 It's my first time to meet you.

152
243.00 --> 245.00
 Oh yeah, I've met you several times.

153
245.00 --> 247.00
 I'm Shiyu.

154
247.00 --> 249.00
 I'm Moto.

155
249.00 --> 251.00
 Nice to meet you.

156
251.00 --> 253.00
 I'm nervous.

157
253.00 --> 255.00
 You don't have to be nervous.

158
255.00 --> 257.00
 Just relax.

159
257.00 --> 259.00
 You don't have to be nervous.

160
259.00 --> 261.00
 Why are you laughing?

161
261.00 --> 263.00
 You're cute.

162
263.00 --> 265.00
 You're cute.

163
265.00 --> 267.00
 You're cute.

164
267.00 --> 269.00
 It was 999 yen.

165
269.00 --> 271.00
 It's very cheap.

166
271.00 --> 273.00
 You're a man.

167
273.00 --> 275.00
 Where can I buy this?

168
277.00 --> 279.00
 It's very cheap.

169
279.00 --> 281.00
 It's not a supermarket.

170
281.00 --> 283.00
 Let's buy a seat belt.

171
283.00 --> 285.00
 There is a convenience store.

172
285.00 --> 287.00
 Do you want something?

173
287.00 --> 289.00
 I want something cold.

174
289.00 --> 291.00
 Do you have it?

175
291.00 --> 293.00
 Something cold.

176
297.00 --> 299.00
 Let's buy it.

177
299.00 --> 301.00
 There is a convenience store.

178
301.00 --> 303.00
 It's a seat belt.

179
313.00 --> 315.00
 I bought it.

180
317.00 --> 319.00
 Let's go.

181
319.00 --> 321.00
 Let's go.

182
323.00 --> 325.00
 Let's go.

183
325.00 --> 327.00
 It's hot.

184
329.00 --> 331.00
 I was looking forward to it.

185
331.00 --> 333.00
 What is it?

186
333.00 --> 335.00
 Is this a camera?

187
335.00 --> 337.00
 What is it?

188
337.00 --> 339.00
 Is this a camera?

189
339.00 --> 341.00
 Wait a minute.

190
341.00 --> 343.00
 What are you talking about?

191
343.00 --> 345.00
 Time and space are distorted.

192
345.00 --> 347.00
 This is a memory of the trip.

193
347.00 --> 349.00
 Why am I the only one?

194
351.00 --> 353.00
 Didn't you ask Sasaki?

195
353.00 --> 355.00
 I didn't ask you because I didn't have fun.

196
361.00 --> 363.00
 I didn't ask you to take a picture of me.

197
363.00 --> 365.00
 I didn't ask you.

198
365.00 --> 367.00
 I didn't ask you.

199
367.00 --> 369.00
 You asked me like you have a surprise.

200
369.00 --> 371.00
 Is this the first surprise?

201
371.00 --> 373.00
 I want to see this.

202
373.00 --> 375.00
 Camera, please.

203
377.00 --> 379.00
 This is the first one.

204
379.00 --> 381.00
 What is the fashion point of today?

205
381.00 --> 383.00
 It's refreshing.

206
383.00 --> 385.00
 Is that a bra?

207
385.00 --> 389.00
 No, it's not a bra.

208
389.00 --> 393.00
 Are you a junior of Aoi's part-time job?

209
393.00 --> 396.00
 Yes, I am.

210
396.00 --> 400.00
 What are you doing?

211
400.00 --> 402.00
 What do you think I'm doing?

212
402.00 --> 404.00
 I don't know.

213
404.00 --> 407.00
 Look at Aoi.

214
407.00 --> 410.00
 It's a woman's jump shot.

215
410.00 --> 412.00
 It's cool.

216
412.00 --> 413.00
 It's me.

217
413.00 --> 414.00
 It's nice.

218
414.00 --> 418.00
 You look like a middle-aged man doing kanji.

219
418.00 --> 420.00
 It's nice.

220
420.00 --> 423.00
 You're wearing a kakuzai.

221
423.00 --> 424.00
 It's cool.

222
424.00 --> 427.00
 I can't do that.

223
427.00 --> 429.00
 What is it?

224
429.00 --> 430.00
 I don't know.

225
430.00 --> 433.00
 You can't imagine it.

226
433.00 --> 435.00
 I imagined it.

227
435.00 --> 437.00
 I imagined a jump shot.

228
437.00 --> 441.00
 It doesn't look like a jump shot at all.

229
441.00 --> 444.00
 You can imagine it.

230
444.00 --> 445.00
 I don't know.

231
445.00 --> 449.63
 Give me a hint.

232
449.63 --> 455.63
 It's a serious job.

233
455.63 --> 458.63
 It's related to people.

234
458.63 --> 460.63
 It's a big service.

235
460.63 --> 462.63
 I don't know.

236
462.63 --> 464.63
 It's related to people.

237
465.63 --> 469.63
 Maybe it's a restaurant?

238
469.63 --> 470.63
 No.

239
470.63 --> 473.63
 You're very serious.

240
473.63 --> 478.63
 Restaurant therapists are another story.

241
478.63 --> 482.63
 The answer is...

242
482.63 --> 485.63
 Maybe it's related to people.

243
485.63 --> 490.63
 Maybe it's a convenience store clerk.

244
490.63 --> 493.63
 You keep looking.

245
493.63 --> 495.63
 Let's go to the convenience store.

246
495.63 --> 497.63
 Let's go as we are.

247
497.63 --> 499.63
 It's time to think.

248
502.63 --> 503.63
 Let's go.

249
503.63 --> 505.63
 Everyone.

250
505.63 --> 507.63
 Let's go.

251
507.63 --> 509.63
 KP.

252
509.63 --> 511.63
 Let's go.

253
513.63 --> 515.63
 It's good.

254
515.63 --> 517.63
 It's delicious.

255
517.63 --> 519.63
 Cheers.

256
519.63 --> 521.63
 Thank you.

257
521.63 --> 523.63
 Thank you.

258
525.63 --> 527.63
 It's delicious.

259
527.63 --> 529.63
 I recommend this.

260
529.63 --> 531.63
 Really?

261
531.63 --> 533.63
 I can drink this.

262
533.63 --> 535.63
 I was happy.

263
535.63 --> 537.63
 I want you to try it.

264
537.63 --> 541.52
 You know a good beer.

265
541.52 --> 543.52
 Do you have any other recommendations?

266
545.52 --> 547.52
 Highball is also delicious.

267
547.52 --> 549.52
 I agree.

268
549.52 --> 551.52
 I want you to recommend a job.

269
551.52 --> 553.52
 That's right.

270
553.52 --> 555.52
 I was distracted by alcohol.

271
555.52 --> 557.52
 What is it?

272
559.52 --> 561.52
 A job.

273
561.52 --> 563.52
 What is it?

274
563.52 --> 565.52
 Lifesaver.

275
565.52 --> 567.52
 That's cool.

276
569.52 --> 571.52
 You are serious.

277
571.52 --> 573.52
 Really?

278
573.52 --> 575.52
 What is it?

279
575.52 --> 577.52
 What is the answer?

280
577.52 --> 579.52
 The answer is...

281
583.52 --> 585.52
 It's not flying.

282
585.52 --> 587.52
 I'm sorry.

283
587.52 --> 589.52
 I'm sorry.

284
589.52 --> 591.52
 I'm sorry.

285
591.52 --> 593.52
 The answer is...

286
593.52 --> 595.52
 I'm a teacher.

287
597.52 --> 599.52
 I'm a teacher.

288
599.52 --> 601.52
 What do you teach?

289
601.52 --> 603.52
 English and...

290
603.52 --> 605.52
 Japanese history.

291
605.52 --> 607.52
 I'm good at grammar.

292
607.52 --> 609.52
 Are you good at grammar?

293
609.52 --> 611.52
 Yes.

294
611.52 --> 613.52
 Do you have a boyfriend?

295
613.52 --> 615.52
 That's sudden.

296
615.52 --> 617.52
 Life is sudden.

297
617.52 --> 619.52
 I was surprised.

298
619.52 --> 621.52
 I thought you had a boyfriend.

299
621.52 --> 623.52
 Did you go to Taiwan with him?

300
623.52 --> 627.79
 No.

301
627.79 --> 629.79
 How long have you been together?

302
629.79 --> 635.60
 How long have you been together?

303
635.60 --> 637.60
 I'm looking for a girlfriend.

304
637.60 --> 639.60
 I'm a teacher.

305
639.60 --> 641.60
 You are a divorce lawyer.

306
641.60 --> 643.60
 You are a divorce lawyer.

307
643.60 --> 645.60
 Everyone is raising their hands.

308
645.60 --> 647.60
 Me too.

309
647.60 --> 649.60
 Are you all here?

310
649.60 --> 651.60
 Everyone is free.

311
651.60 --> 653.60
 You guys haven't been together for 4 years.

312
653.60 --> 655.60
 4 years?

313
655.60 --> 657.60
 Why haven't you been together for 4 years?

314
657.60 --> 659.60
 Why?

315
659.60 --> 661.60
 You shouldn't say that.

316
661.60 --> 663.60
 It hurts.

317
663.60 --> 665.60
 It hurts.

318
665.60 --> 667.60
 You'll get into an accident.

319
667.60 --> 668.60
 This isn't good.

320
668.60 --> 670.60
 It's a good opportunity to say it but...

321
670.60 --> 672.60
 Critical hit.

322
675.60 --> 677.60
 Show me your weak points.

323
678.60 --> 679.60
 Show me your weak points?

324
680.60 --> 681.60
 You're cute.

325
681.60 --> 683.60
 Even though you're dressed up,

326
683.60 --> 686.60
 you're so cute at home.

327
687.60 --> 688.60
 That's that.

328
688.60 --> 691.60
 You're cute with your hat on.

329
691.60 --> 692.60
 I think you're cute.

330
722.60 --> 723.60
 Wow.

331
723.60 --> 726.60
 1 point.

332
726.60 --> 729.60
 Not a point.

333
729.60 --> 731.60
 Oh, man.

334
731.60 --> 734.60
 You're so young, but you're whining.

335
734.60 --> 735.60
 I'm a boy.

336
735.60 --> 736.60
 You're so childish.

337
736.60 --> 737.60
 You're a boy.

338
737.60 --> 738.60
 I'm a boy.

339
738.60 --> 739.60
 A boy forever.

340
739.60 --> 743.60
 I want to have fun in silly things.

341
743.60 --> 747.60
 I make a silly smile.

342
747.60 --> 753.42
 I want to be able to see such a place.

343
753.42 --> 755.42
 Come this way.

344
757.42 --> 759.42
 Watch your step.

345
766.06 --> 767.06
 It's huge.

346
768.06 --> 769.06
 It's huge, isn't it?

347
769.06 --> 770.06
 It's really huge.

348
774.22 --> 776.22
 It's amazing.

349
777.22 --> 778.22
 It's huge.

350
779.22 --> 781.98
 This way.

351
786.98 --> 788.98
 It's really huge.

352
789.98 --> 790.98
 It's amazing.

353
793.98 --> 794.98
 It's really cute.

354
794.98 --> 795.98
 It's huge, isn't it?

355
795.98 --> 796.98
 It's really cute.

356
796.98 --> 797.98
 It's huge.

357
797.98 --> 798.98
 It's amazing.

358
798.98 --> 801.98
 Can I put my luggage in the living room?

359
801.98 --> 802.98
 Sure.

360
806.98 --> 807.98
 Take your time.

361
808.98 --> 809.98
 Look at this. It's a pool.

362
810.98 --> 812.98
 It's a pool.

363
812.98 --> 813.98
 It's amazing.

364
813.98 --> 814.98
 It's amazing.

365
814.98 --> 815.98
 Look at this.

366
817.98 --> 818.98
 It's hot.

367
818.98 --> 819.98
 It's hot in the pool.

368
819.98 --> 820.98
 Let's go in.

369
820.98 --> 821.98
 Let's go in.

370
823.98 --> 826.42
 Oh, you're wearing a swimsuit.

371
829.42 --> 830.42
 Please sit down.

372
830.42 --> 831.42
 Thank you.

373
833.42 --> 834.42
 There is a person.

374
834.42 --> 835.42
 There is.

375
835.42 --> 836.42
 No, no.

376
837.42 --> 838.42
 You're wearing a swimsuit again.

377
838.42 --> 840.42
 What kind of swimsuit is it?

378
840.42 --> 842.42
 It's light blue.

379
842.42 --> 843.42
 Light blue?

380
843.42 --> 844.42
 It's light blue.

381
845.42 --> 846.42
 It suits you.

382
846.42 --> 848.42
 Let's go into the pool.

383
848.42 --> 849.42
 Let's go in the pool.

384
852.42 --> 853.42
 Let's get changed.

385
853.42 --> 854.42
 Let's get changed.

386
858.42 --> 860.42
 Excuse me.

387
860.42 --> 862.42
 Let's change in the rec Eva!

388
863.42 --> 864.42
 It's possible.

389
864.42 --> 865.42
 Let's do it!

390
867.42 --> 868.42
 For now.

391
868.42 --> 870.42
 The next day

392
872.42 --> 874.42
 I'm so sad.

393
897.51 --> 902.23
 It's raining.

394
980.60 --> 982.60
 It's hot.

395
982.60 --> 984.60
 It's hot.

396

 It's so cute.

398
1002.30 --> 1004.30
 It's hot.

399
1012.30 --> 1014.30
 You can sit down.

400
1016.30 --> 1018.30
 No, no, no.

401
1018.30 --> 1022.44
 Look at this.

403
1028.44 --> 1030.44
 It's cold.

 I can't take it.

410
1058.44 --> 1060.44
 It's cold.

411
1070.07 --> 1072.07
 It looks fun.

 It's fun.

413
1076.07 --> 1078.07
 It looks fun.

414

 It's fun.

415

 It's too much fun.

416
1092.39 --> 1094.39
 It's cold.

417
1094.39 --> 1096.39
 It's cold.

418
1096.39 --> 1098.39
 It's cold.

419
1100.39 --> 1102.39
 It's cold.

420
1102.39 --> 1104.39
 It's cold.

421
1106.39 --> 1108.39
 It's cute.

422
1108.39 --> 1110.39
 Look at the camera.

423
1110.39 --> 1112.39
 It's a commemorative photo.

424
1112.39 --> 1114.39
 Peace.

425
1118.39 --> 1120.39
 It's cold.

426
1120.39 --> 1122.39
 Let's take a break.

427
1122.39 --> 1124.39
 Let's take a break.

428
1124.39 --> 1126.39
 I'm getting cold.

429
1126.39 --> 1128.39
 Let's go home.

430
1128.39 --> 1130.39
 What are you wearing?

431
1130.39 --> 1132.39
 I'm tired.

432
1132.39 --> 1138.58
 I'm going to take a shower.

433
1138.58 --> 1156.62
 I'm going to take a shower.

434
1162.12 --> 1170.30
 Where is it?

435
1170.30 --> 1178.60
 There it is.

436
1178.60 --> 1180.60
 I'm sorry.

437
1180.60 --> 1182.60
 I'm sorry.

438
1182.60 --> 1189.62
 I'm glad you're okay.

439
1189.62 --> 1239.37
 I'm glad you're okay.

440
1239.37 --> 1241.37
 You're good at it.

441
1241.37 --> 1327.56
 You're good at it.

442
1333.56 --> 1335.56
 I'm OK.

443
1335.56 --> 1337.56
 I'm OK.

444
1337.56 --> 1339.56
 I have to go.

445
1341.56 --> 1343.56
 I have to go.

446
1343.56 --> 1345.56
 It's a great leader.

447
1345.56 --> 1347.56
 It's cool.

448
1347.56 --> 1349.56
 It's dark in here.

449
1349.56 --> 1351.56
 It's not dark.

450
1351.56 --> 1353.56
 You're doing your best.

451
1353.56 --> 1355.56
 You're doing your best.

452
1355.56 --> 1357.56
 I'm not doing my best.

453
1359.56 --> 1361.56
 It was fun.

454
1367.56 --> 1369.56
 What should we do for dinner?

455
1369.56 --> 1371.56
 What should we do?

456
1371.56 --> 1373.56
 What do you want to eat?

457
1373.56 --> 1375.56
 Let's make a snack.

458
1375.56 --> 1377.56
 Okay.

459
1377.56 --> 1379.56
 There's a supermarket near here.

460
1379.56 --> 1381.56
 I want to buy something.

461
1381.56 --> 1383.56
 How about a training camp?

462
1383.56 --> 1385.56
 What do you want to do?

463
1385.56 --> 1387.56
 Foie gras.

464
1387.56 --> 1389.56
 Foie gras.

465
1393.56 --> 1395.56
 Curry.

466
1395.56 --> 1397.56
 Curry?

467
1397.56 --> 1399.56
 This is good.

468
1399.56 --> 1401.56
 Do you like curry?

469
1401.56 --> 1403.56
 Which one do you like?

470
1403.56 --> 1404.56
 It's sweet.

471
1404.56 --> 1405.56
 It's not sweet?

472
1405.56 --> 1406.56
 It's sweet.

473
1406.56 --> 1407.56
 It's delicious.

474
1407.56 --> 1409.56
 I'm the only one who doesn't know about supermarkets.

475
1409.56 --> 1411.56
 I'm the only one who can make black money.

476
1411.56 --> 1412.56
 I don't know.

477
1412.56 --> 1414.56
 Then we'll go together.

478
1415.56 --> 1416.56
 Really?

479
1416.56 --> 1417.56
 Let's go.

480
1419.56 --> 1421.56
 No, I'm fine with just the two of us.

481
1423.56 --> 1425.56
 It can't be helped.

482
1425.56 --> 1427.56
 You're kind.

483
1427.56 --> 1429.56
 It can't be helped.

484
1429.56 --> 1430.56
 It's expensive.

485
1431.56 --> 1433.56
 I'm going to take the table.

486
1436.56 --> 1437.56
 Bye.

487
1437.56 --> 1439.56
 Please come back again.

488
1439.56 --> 1441.56
 The table was set nicely.

489
1441.56 --> 1442.56
 I'm glad.

490
1442.56 --> 1444.56
 Are you drinking too much?

491
1444.56 --> 1446.56
 You're drinking too much, aren't you?

492
1446.56 --> 1448.56
 But I'm really hydrated.

493
1448.56 --> 1450.56
 We went to a beer bar at Shunsatsu Island.

494
1450.56 --> 1451.56
 Yes, we did.

495
1451.56 --> 1452.56
 Whhat did we drink?

496
1452.56 --> 1454.56
 Oh, you meant the beer in Taiwan.

497
1454.56 --> 1455.56
 Yes.

498
1456.56 --> 1458.56
 Why didn't we drink Taiwanese beer?

499
1676.83 --> 1678.83
 I'm

500
1678.83 --> 1680.83
 doing it.

501
1680.83 --> 1682.83
 Let's do it.

502
1682.83 --> 1684.83
 I'm

503
1684.83 --> 1686.83
 doing it.

504
1686.83 --> 1688.83
 When did you do it?

505
1688.83 --> 1690.83
 I put it here.

506
1690.83 --> 1692.83
 It's elegant.

507
1692.83 --> 1694.83
 It's so big.

508
1694.83 --> 1696.83
 I'm going to take it off.

509
1696.83 --> 1698.83
 I'm going to take it off.

510
1698.83 --> 1700.83
 Yes,

511
1700.83 --> 1702.83
 let's eat this.

512
1702.83 --> 1704.83
 It's spilling.

513
1704.83 --> 1706.83
 It's spilling.

514
1706.83 --> 1708.83
 It's spilling.

515
1708.83 --> 1710.83
 It's spilling.

516
1710.83 --> 1712.83
 What are you doing?

517
1712.83 --> 1714.83
 Me too.

518
1714.83 --> 1716.83
 Huh?

519
1716.83 --> 1718.83
 What is it?

520
1718.83 --> 1720.83
 I'll take this off.

521
1720.83 --> 1722.83
 What happened to you?

522
1722.83 --> 1724.83
 It's spilling.

523
1724.83 --> 1726.83
 Wait!

524
1726.83 --> 1728.83
 It's too much.

525
1728.83 --> 1730.83
 It's a retry.

526
1730.83 --> 1733.83
 Megu-chan, drink mine too.

527
1733.83 --> 1735.83
 What? You just kissed me.

528
1736.83 --> 1737.83
 What?

529
1743.83 --> 1745.83
 Aren't you drinking more?

530
1745.83 --> 1746.83
 Did you drink a lot?

531
1746.83 --> 1747.83
 Wait.

532
1747.83 --> 1749.83
 Is it okay because it's an apple?

533
1749.83 --> 1751.83
 It's an apple, so it's okay.

534
1756.83 --> 1758.83
 I'll eat it later.

535
1760.83 --> 1762.83
 It's an apple, so it's okay.

536
1770.83 --> 1772.83
 It's an apple, so it's okay.

537
1772.83 --> 1774.83
 It's spilling a lot.

538
1777.83 --> 1779.83
 What's wrong with you?

539
1779.83 --> 1780.83
 I have to wipe it off.

540
1780.83 --> 1781.83
 It's delicious.

541
1781.83 --> 1782.83
 It's delicious.

542
1782.83 --> 1784.83
 Megu-san, wait.

543
1784.83 --> 1786.83
 Megu-san, wait.

544
1787.83 --> 1789.83
 I'm going to pour it.

545
1791.83 --> 1793.83
 Don't waste it.

546
1799.83 --> 1801.83
 Megu-chan, don't waste it.

547
1806.83 --> 1808.83
 It smells bad.

548
1808.83 --> 1809.83
 It smells bad.

549
1809.83 --> 1811.83
 Wait a minute.

550
1811.83 --> 1813.83
 Do you want to eat it?

551
1813.83 --> 1815.83
 It's so delicious.

552
1817.83 --> 1819.83
 What's that?

553
1819.83 --> 1821.83
 It's a little too rough.

554
1823.83 --> 1825.83
 It's okay.

555
1835.83 --> 1837.83
 It's wet.

556
1837.83 --> 1839.83
 Oh, my God.

557
1841.83 --> 1843.83
 You have to wipe it.

558
1843.83 --> 1845.83
 Towel.

559
1845.83 --> 1847.83
 I'll wipe it with my hands.

560
1847.83 --> 1849.83
 Where's the towel?

561
1849.83 --> 1851.83
 Towel?

562
1851.83 --> 1853.83
 I'll wipe it.

563
1853.83 --> 1855.83
 You have to wipe it.

564
1857.83 --> 1859.83
 Oh, my God.

565
1861.83 --> 1863.83
 Your boobs are so soft.

566
1867.83 --> 1869.83
 What are you doing?

567
1871.83 --> 1873.83
 Oh, my God.

568
1873.83 --> 1875.83
 Your ears are so cute.

569
1881.83 --> 1883.83
 Oh, my God.

570
1906.73 --> 1908.73
 What's wrong with your boobs?

571
1914.73 --> 1916.73
 What's wrong with your boobs?

572
1916.73 --> 1918.73
 I can't.

573
1918.73 --> 1920.73
 Do you want to see it?

574
1922.73 --> 1924.73
 Oh, my God.

575
1924.73 --> 1926.73
 What's wrong with your boobs?

576
1928.73 --> 1930.73
 Tell me.

577
1930.73 --> 1932.73
 Is it okay to wipe it?

578
1932.73 --> 1934.73
 What kind of garbage is it?

579
1934.73 --> 1936.73
 It's okay, isn't it?

580
1936.73 --> 1938.73
 It's okay, isn't it?

581
1938.73 --> 1940.73
 Oh, my God.

582
1942.73 --> 1944.73
 Don't hide it.

583
1950.49 --> 1952.49
 Look at this.

584
1952.49 --> 1954.49
 Don't do that.

585
1956.49 --> 1958.49
 It's so cute.

586
1958.49 --> 1960.49
 Look at this.

587
1960.49 --> 1962.49
 It's cute.

588
1962.49 --> 1964.49
 It's embarrassing.

589
1964.49 --> 1966.49
 I can't.

590
1966.49 --> 1968.49
 You saw it, didn't you?

591
1968.49 --> 1970.49
 I saw it.

592
1970.49 --> 1972.49
 I can't.

593
1972.49 --> 1974.49
 They're back.

594
1974.49 --> 1976.49
 What should we do?

595
1976.49 --> 1978.49
 Let's go to the supermarket.

596
1978.49 --> 1980.49
 That's not a good idea.

597
1980.49 --> 1982.49
 Let's hide upstairs.

598
1982.49 --> 1984.49
 Let's go upstairs.

599
1984.49 --> 1986.49
 Wait a minute.

600
1986.49 --> 1988.49
 What are you going to do?

601
1988.49 --> 1990.49
 It's amazing.

602
1990.49 --> 1992.49
 It's so bright.

603
1992.49 --> 1994.49
 It's amazing.

604
1994.49 --> 1996.49
 It's so bright.

605
1996.49 --> 1998.49
 It's amazing.

606
1998.49 --> 2000.49
 I like Ticamel.

607
2000.49 --> 2002.49
 I like Ticamel.

608
2002.49 --> 2004.49
 I don't want to.

609
2004.49 --> 2006.49
 I don't want to.

610
2006.49 --> 2013.38
 Look at me.

611
2013.38 --> 2017.66
 I'm a good boy.

612
2017.66 --> 2019.66
 I'm a good boy.

613
2019.66 --> 2021.66
 It's embarrassing.

614
2021.66 --> 2023.66
 It's embarrassing.

615
2029.66 --> 2031.66
 What's wrong?

616
2031.66 --> 2033.66
 What are you doing?

617
2033.66 --> 2035.66
 It looks delicious.

618
2041.66 --> 2043.66
 It's delicious.

619
2045.66 --> 2047.66
 What are you doing?

620
2051.66 --> 2053.66
 Rui-chan, you are so cute.

621
2053.66 --> 2055.66
 Are you licking me?

622
2068.66 --> 2070.66
 Your hair is delicious.

623
2070.66 --> 2072.66
 You have a stiff neck.

624
2075.66 --> 2077.66
 Still not good?

625
2077.66 --> 2079.66
 What is this?

626
2079.66 --> 2081.66
 I don't like it.

627
2086.66 --> 2088.66
 You can't put your feet here.

628
2088.66 --> 2090.66
 You can't put your feet here.

629
2090.66 --> 2092.66
 I don't like it.

630
2092.66 --> 2094.66
 You know what I mean, right?

631
2094.66 --> 2096.66
 I don't like it.

632
2106.66 --> 2108.66
 This is fun.

633
2108.66 --> 2110.66
 This is not fun.

634
2115.66 --> 2117.66
 What are you licking?

635
2117.66 --> 2119.66
 I don't like it.

636
2119.66 --> 2121.66
 You don't like it?

637
2129.66 --> 2131.66
 You are so soft.

638
2131.66 --> 2133.66
 You are so fluffy.

639
2133.66 --> 2135.66
 I don't like it.

640
2135.66 --> 2137.66
 Are you a fluffy man?

641
2137.66 --> 2139.66
 I don't like it.

642
2143.25 --> 2145.25
 She got a reaction.

643
2145.25 --> 2147.25
 You are a little popular.

644
2147.25 --> 2149.25
 I see.

645
2149.25 --> 2151.25
 Rui-chan, do you like chestnuts?

646
2151.25 --> 2153.25
 Do you like chestnuts?

647
2153.25 --> 2155.25
 Chestnuts?

648
2157.25 --> 2159.25
 I can't say such a difficult thing.

649
2159.25 --> 2161.25
 Which do you like?

650
2161.25 --> 2163.25
 I don't like it.

651
2163.25 --> 2165.25
 I don't like it.

652
2165.25 --> 2167.25
 Look at the camera and say it.

653
2167.25 --> 2169.25
 I don't like it because it's embarrassing.

654
2170.25 --> 2172.25
 Other people may see it.

655
2172.25 --> 2174.25
 Other people may see it.

656
2174.25 --> 2176.25
 They may not see it.

657
2176.25 --> 2178.25
 I don't like it because they may not see it.

658
2178.25 --> 2180.25
 I will direct the editing.

659
2180.25 --> 2182.25
 Look at it.

660
2182.25 --> 2184.25
 You can see your figure if you do this.

661
2186.25 --> 2188.25
 Can I show this to other people?

662
2188.25 --> 2190.25
 No, you can't.

663
2190.25 --> 2192.25
 That's what you mean, right?

664
2192.25 --> 2194.25
 This is cute.

665
2194.25 --> 2196.25
 Look at it.

666
2196.25 --> 2198.25
 I don't like it.

667
2198.25 --> 2200.25
 It's embarrassing.

668
2200.25 --> 2202.25
 I don't like it.

669
2202.25 --> 2204.25
 Are you hiding it?

670
2204.25 --> 2206.25
 No, I don't like it.

671
2206.25 --> 2208.25
 I don't like it.

672
2208.25 --> 2210.25
 I don't like it.

673
2210.25 --> 2212.25
 Rui-chan is popular.

674
2212.25 --> 2214.25
 I don't like it.

675
2216.25 --> 2218.25
 Can I open it?

676
2218.25 --> 2220.25
 Do you want to open it yourself?

677
2220.25 --> 2222.25
 Which do you like?

678
2222.25 --> 2224.25
 I don't like it.

679
2224.25 --> 2226.25
 Look at it.

680
2226.25 --> 2228.25
 I opened it.

681
2228.25 --> 2230.25
 It's a very beautiful pink.

682
2230.25 --> 2232.25
 Look at it.

683
2232.25 --> 2234.25
 I don't like it.

684
2234.25 --> 2236.25
 It's erotic.

685
2236.25 --> 2245.32
 I don't like it.

686
2245.32 --> 2247.32
 Can I touch it?

687
2257.32 --> 2264.66
 Rui-chan, you don't like it.

688
2264.66 --> 2266.66
 I don't like it.

689
2266.66 --> 2268.66
 Can I kiss you?

690
2268.66 --> 2270.66
 Can I kiss you while laughing?

691
2270.66 --> 2272.66
 I don't like it.

692
2296.04 --> 2298.04
 I don't like it.

693
2298.04 --> 2300.04
 It tastes like alcohol.

694
2300.04 --> 2302.04
 It smells like alcohol.

695
2302.04 --> 2304.04
 But it's cute.

696
2304.04 --> 2306.04
 I think it's too much alcohol.

697
2306.04 --> 2308.04
 Alcohol is delicious.

698
2308.04 --> 2313.02
 You're saying it's cute.

699
2313.02 --> 2315.02
 I don't like it.

700
2315.02 --> 2317.02
 I don't like it.

701
2317.02 --> 2320.78
 You have a lot of hair.

702
2322.78 --> 2324.78
 Don't say that.

703
2324.78 --> 2329.56
 I don't like it.

704
2329.56 --> 2331.56
 You're very excited.

705
2331.56 --> 2333.56
 Try putting your finger in.

706
2333.56 --> 2335.56
 Do you want to try it?

707
2335.56 --> 2340.22
 Do you want to put your finger in?

708
2357.27 --> 2359.27
 Do you feel better?

709
2384.38 --> 2386.38
 I'll be right there.

710
2392.38 --> 2394.38
 Hold the camera.

711
2406.38 --> 2408.38
 How do you feel?

712
2408.38 --> 2410.38
 Look at the camera.

713
2410.38 --> 2412.38
 Do you feel better?

714
2412.38 --> 2414.38
 How many times?

715
2418.78 --> 2420.78
 Don't you feel better?

716
2424.78 --> 2426.78
 I don't like it.

717
2428.78 --> 2430.78
 You touched my dick.

718
2430.78 --> 2432.78
 I didn't touch it.

719
2434.78 --> 2436.78
 You grabbed my dick.

720
2436.78 --> 2438.78
 That's why your dick is like this.

721
2440.78 --> 2442.78
 Look at this.

722
2442.78 --> 2444.78
 What do you think?

723
2444.78 --> 2446.78
 I don't like it.

724
2446.78 --> 2448.78
 I don't like it.

725
2452.78 --> 2454.78
 I'm holding your dick.

726
2462.78 --> 2464.78
 Which one do you like?

727
2466.78 --> 2468.78
 Both.

728
2468.78 --> 2470.78
 I don't like it.

729
2483.19 --> 2485.19
 I feel something.

730
2485.19 --> 2487.19
 What is it?

731
2487.19 --> 2489.19
 I don't like it.

732
2493.19 --> 2495.19
 Try it.

733
2495.19 --> 2497.19
 It tastes like alcohol.

734
2497.19 --> 2499.19
 Alcohol?

735
2503.19 --> 2505.19
 Look at the camera.

736
2513.08 --> 2515.08
 It's a little salty.

737
2515.08 --> 2517.08
 Salty?

738
2519.08 --> 2521.08
 It feels good.

739
2527.67 --> 2529.67
 Don't you lick it?

740
2529.67 --> 2531.67
 You licked my dick.

741
2531.67 --> 2533.67
 I want you to lick my dick.

742
2543.85 --> 2558.36
 Don't you like it?

743
2558.36 --> 2560.36
 Don't you like it?

744
2560.36 --> 2562.36
 I don't like it.

745
2572.25 --> 2574.25
 I want you to lick my dick.

746
2574.25 --> 2576.25
 I don't like it.

747
2576.25 --> 2578.25
 Do you like it?

748
2588.01 --> 2590.01
 You are so cute.

749
2597.94 --> 2599.94
 You are so cute.

750
2599.94 --> 2613.30
 You are doing a great job.

751
2631.66 --> 2633.66
 Do you like it?

752
2633.66 --> 2637.10
 Do you want me to lick your dick?

753
2645.10 --> 2647.10
 Come here.

754
2647.10 --> 2649.10
 Come here.

755
2649.10 --> 2651.10
 I'm sorry.

756
2651.10 --> 2653.10
 I'm sorry.

757
2657.10 --> 2659.10
 You are great.

758

 You are great.

759
2661.10 --> 2663.10

761
2665.10 --> 2667.10
 I'm sorry.

762
2667.10 --> 2669.10
 Can I lick your dick?

763
2669.10 --> 2671.10
 It's dirty.

764
2671.10 --> 2673.10
 It's dirty.

765
2693.14 --> 2695.14
 It's dirty.

766
2695.14 --> 2697.14
 It's dirty.

767
2697.14 --> 2699.14
 It's dirty.

768
2699.14 --> 2701.14
 It's dirty.

769
2701.14 --> 2703.14
 It's dirty.

770
2710.44 --> 2712.44
 You licked my butt.

771
2714.44 --> 2716.44
 Did you like it?

772
2720.44 --> 2722.44
 You are great.

773
2722.44 --> 2724.44
 You are great.

774
2724.44 --> 2726.44
 Do you like it?

775
2726.44 --> 2728.44
 Do you like it?

776
2728.44 --> 2730.44
 Do you like it?

777
2730.44 --> 2732.44
 Do you like it?

778
2732.44 --> 2736.58
 Do you like it?

779
2742.58 --> 2746.47
 You are soft.

780
2748.47 --> 2750.47
 You are soft.

781
2750.47 --> 2752.47
 You are soft.

782
2752.47 --> 2754.47
 Lick it while leaning on my lap.

783
2754.47 --> 2756.47
 Lick it while leeing on my lap.

784
3020.92 --> 3023.92

 The baby is crying.

789
3171.47 --> 3174.47
 I will continue to watch the video until the end.

790

3180.47 --> 3183.47
 Thank you for your viewing.

793
3190.47 --> 3193.78
 Do you want to drink water?

794
3211.42 --> 3213.42
 You are very good girl

795
3222.42 --> 3224.42
 Thank you

796
3228.42 --> 3230.42
 Do you want me to hold your hand?

797
3232.42 --> 3234.42
 You are very good girl

798
3239.42 --> 3241.42
 You are very good girl

799
3260.36 --> 3262.36
 Do you want to drink water?

800
3276.18 --> 3278.18
 Let me see your face

801
3294.92 --> 3296.92
 Did you drink water?

802
3300.92 --> 3302.92
 Thank you

803
3304.92 --> 3306.92
 Did you drink water?

804
3310.87 --> 3312.87
 Do you want me to hold your hand?

805
3359.88 --> 3361.88
 Do you want me to hold your hand?

806
3377.88 --> 3379.88
 I can't

807
3379.88 --> 3381.88
 I can't

808
3385.32 --> 3389.72
 I can't

809
3389.72 --> 3391.72
 I can't

810
3407.19 --> 3409.19
 I can't

811
3427.19 --> 3429.19
 Let me see

812
3441.51 --> 3443.51
 I can't

813
3458.57 --> 3460.57
 Let me see

814
3462.57 --> 3464.57
 You like it

815
3470.46 --> 3472.46
 It's delicious

816
3472.46 --> 3474.46
 Did you like mine?

817
3476.46 --> 3478.46
 You are very sexy

818
3478.46 --> 3480.46
 You are very sexy

819
3513.43 --> 3515.43
 You are very sexy

820
3515.43 --> 3517.43
 I didn't say anything.

821
3517.43 --> 3519.43
 But you suddenly said that.

822
3519.43 --> 3522.43
 We were surprised, too.

823
3525.43 --> 3527.43
 Men are always welcome.

824
3528.43 --> 3530.43
 What do you mean?

825
3531.43 --> 3533.43
 That's what I mean.

826
3536.13 --> 3538.13
 Do you want to prank her?

827
3542.42 --> 3543.42
 We're here.

828
3543.42 --> 3545.42
 We're here.

829
3546.42 --> 3548.42
 I'm tired.

830
3550.42 --> 3552.42
 What's wrong?

831
3552.42 --> 3555.42
 I got a message.

832
3555.42 --> 3557.42
 Yahoo?

833
3557.42 --> 3559.42
 Yahoo?

834
3559.42 --> 3561.42
 I was surprised, too.

835
3561.42 --> 3562.42
 Really?

836
3562.42 --> 3564.42
 What's wrong?

837
3564.42 --> 3565.42
 What is it?

838
3565.42 --> 3569.89
 How is the shopping?

839
3569.89 --> 3573.89
 Moto and Meru are in love.

840
3573.89 --> 3574.89
 What?

841
3574.89 --> 3576.89
 We're in love?

842
3576.89 --> 3581.89
 I'm going to send Meru to them.

843
3581.89 --> 3583.89
 What's wrong with him?

844
3583.89 --> 3585.89
 What?

845
3588.89 --> 3590.89
 This is the script.

846
3590.89 --> 3592.89
 We were left behind.

847
3592.89 --> 3594.89
 He's underestimating us.

848
3594.89 --> 3596.89
 He's underestimating us.

849
3596.89 --> 3599.89
 He pretended not to know and teased us.

850
3599.89 --> 3601.89
 But he knew it.

851
3601.89 --> 3603.89
 It's a counter-prank.

852
3604.89 --> 3606.89
 That's good.

853
3607.89 --> 3610.89
 Let's go home.

854
3611.89 --> 3613.89
 Let's go home.

855
3613.89 --> 3615.89
 It's hot.

856
3616.89 --> 3618.89
 What's going on?

857
3618.89 --> 3620.89
 She's cooking.

858
3621.89 --> 3623.89
 I didn't notice.

859
3623.89 --> 3625.89
 It's hot.

860
3625.89 --> 3627.89
 It's hot.

861
3643.59 --> 3646.90
 It's cool.

862
3646.90 --> 3648.90
 It's cool inside.

863
3648.90 --> 3652.47
 It's hot outside.

864
3652.47 --> 3654.47
 Can I take this off?

865
3654.47 --> 3656.47
 How can I take this off?

866
3656.47 --> 3658.47
 Can you help me?

867
3658.47 --> 3660.47
 How can I take this off?

868
3660.47 --> 3662.47
 I'll leave it to you.

869
3662.47 --> 3664.47
 I'll leave it to you.

870
3670.47 --> 3672.47
 How can I take this off?

871
3672.47 --> 3674.47
 It's a mess.

872
3675.47 --> 3677.47
 It's a mess.

873
3681.47 --> 3683.47
 I can't find a peeler.

874
3683.47 --> 3685.47
 A peeler?

875
3686.47 --> 3688.47
 You can't find it?

876
3688.47 --> 3690.47
 I can't find it.

877
3690.47 --> 3692.47
 Peel is nutritious.

878
3692.47 --> 3694.47
 Peel is nutritious.

879
3695.47 --> 3697.47
 You shouldn't peel it.

880
3697.47 --> 3699.47
 I'm fine.

881
3699.47 --> 3701.47
 I'm fine.

882
3701.47 --> 3703.47
 Can you peel it off?

883
3703.47 --> 3705.47
 Can you peel it off?

884
3705.47 --> 3707.47
 I cut it.

885
3707.47 --> 3709.47
 Can I use this?

886
3709.47 --> 3711.47
 Is it hard?

887
3711.47 --> 3726.30
 Don't get hurt.

888
3737.19 --> 3739.19
 What's wrong?

889
3739.19 --> 3741.19
 What's wrong?

890
3749.19 --> 3751.19
 I'm fine.

891
3751.19 --> 3753.19
 I'm fine.

892
3757.19 --> 3759.19
 What's wrong?

893
3759.19 --> 3761.19
 What's wrong?

894
3761.19 --> 3763.19
 I don't know.

895
3763.19 --> 3765.19
 Really?

896
3765.19 --> 3767.19
 It's wriggling.

897
3767.19 --> 3769.19
 It's wriggling.

898
3769.19 --> 3771.19
 It's cute.

899
3773.19 --> 3777.27
 Do you have vegetables?

900
3777.27 --> 3779.27
 Do you have vegetables?

901
3779.27 --> 3781.27
 What's wrong?

902
3781.27 --> 3783.27
 What's wrong?

903
3783.27 --> 3785.27
 I'm fine.

904
3785.27 --> 3787.27
 You're fine.

905
3789.27 --> 3797.51
 The meat is cooked.

906
3797.51 --> 3799.51
 The meat is cooked.

907
3799.51 --> 3801.51
 Look.

908
3802.51 --> 3804.51
 Is it hot?

909
3804.51 --> 3806.51
 It's really hot.

910
3806.51 --> 3808.51
 It's really hot.

911
3811.51 --> 3822.50
 What's wrong?

912
3822.50 --> 3824.50
 Don't touch the fire.

913
3824.50 --> 3826.50
 Don't touch the fire.

914
3826.50 --> 3828.50
 I'm fine.

915
3828.50 --> 3830.50
 I'm fine.

916
3830.50 --> 3844.82
 I'm fine.

917
3845.82 --> 3847.82
 Keep quiet.

918
3877.82 --> 3882.82
 Oh, hey, what?

919
3882.82 --> 3883.82
 What?

920
3883.82 --> 3885.82
 You kissed him.

921
3885.82 --> 3887.82
 You don't refuse at all.

922
3887.82 --> 3888.82
 Why?

923
3888.82 --> 3890.82
 You don't refuse at all?

924
3890.82 --> 3892.82
 I was surprised.

925
3892.82 --> 3894.82
 I was surprised.

926
3898.14 --> 3901.14
 What are you doing?

927
3901.14 --> 3903.14
 I don't know.

928
3903.14 --> 3904.14
 What?

929
3904.14 --> 3905.14
 No, no.

930
3905.14 --> 3906.14
 That's not true.

931
3906.14 --> 3907.14
 What?

932
3907.14 --> 3908.14
 I don't know.

933
3908.14 --> 3912.14
 You seduced us and said you would give us something.

934
3912.14 --> 3914.14
 No, no.

935
3914.14 --> 3916.14
 I didn't mean that.

936
3916.14 --> 3918.14
 That's why you were writing.

937
3918.14 --> 3919.14
 Yes, yes.

938
3919.14 --> 3921.14
 You were stretching your hand at his place.

939
3921.14 --> 3924.14
 I thought you were doing something.

940
3924.14 --> 3926.14
 But you didn't come to me at all.

941
3926.14 --> 3927.14
 I see.

942
3927.14 --> 3928.14
 Yes.

943
3928.14 --> 3930.14
 You have two good things.

944
3930.14 --> 3931.14
 No, wait.

945
3931.14 --> 3932.14
 What?

946
3932.14 --> 3934.14
 You seduced us.

947
3934.14 --> 3936.14
 You seduced us.

948
3936.14 --> 3939.14
 Look, look, look.

949
3941.14 --> 3942.14
 What?

950
3942.14 --> 3944.14
 What are you talking about?

951
3944.14 --> 3946.14
 You seduced us.

952
3946.14 --> 3948.14
 You seduced us.

953
3948.14 --> 3950.14
 I did?

954
3950.14 --> 3951.14
 What's going on?

955
3951.14 --> 3952.14
 You seduced us.

956
3952.14 --> 3954.14
 She touched your hand.

957
3954.14 --> 3959.14
 No, I didn't touch his hand.

958
3959.14 --> 3960.14
 I didn't.

959
3960.14 --> 3961.14
 What?

960
3961.14 --> 3962.14
 I didn't.

961
3962.14 --> 3963.14
 What about you?

962
3963.14 --> 3968.14
 Oh, you touched it.

963
3968.14 --> 3972.14
 Then, it's Mel-chan's turn.

964
3972.14 --> 3975.14
 She doesn't come to me from Mel-chan.

965
3975.14 --> 3977.14
 What is it?

966
3977.14 --> 3981.14
 I was going to do it.

967
3981.14 --> 3984.14
 If you don't seduce me, I can't do it.

968
3984.14 --> 3989.41
 Seduce you?

969
3989.41 --> 3992.41
 I don't know.

970
3992.41 --> 3995.41
 She is in front of you.

971
4000.41 --> 4003.41
 Look at the camera.

972
4017.60 --> 4020.60
 Don't be silent.

973
4020.60 --> 4024.60
 I'm in a position to be seduced, so I'll be silent.

974
4025.60 --> 4028.60
 I didn't do it.

975
4028.60 --> 4031.60
 Then, do it like you did before.

976
4031.60 --> 4034.60
 I didn't do it.

977
4034.60 --> 4038.60
 I'll edit it later, so you can see it if you look at the camera.

978
4038.60 --> 4041.60
 Don't look at it.

979
4041.60 --> 4043.60
 You did it.

980
4043.60 --> 4046.60
 You didn't look at it.

981
4046.60 --> 4049.60
 I didn't do it.

982
4049.60 --> 4051.60
 Why don't you talk to me?

983
4051.60 --> 4054.60
 You keep touching it.

984
4054.60 --> 4057.60
 You like it, don't you?

985
4057.60 --> 4060.60
 You don't have to apologize to me.

986
4064.60 --> 4067.60
 I'll take off your clothes.

987
4067.60 --> 4070.60
 I'll take off your cherries.

988
4070.60 --> 4073.60
 I'll be Cherry Boy.

989
4073.60 --> 4076.60
 I'm the representative of cherries.

990
4076.60 --> 4079.60
 I'll take off your cherries.

991
4080.60 --> 4085.36
 I'm the representative of cherries.

992
4090.36 --> 4093.36
 When you seduce someone, use your eyes.

993
4093.36 --> 4096.36
 What are you fantasizing about?

994
4096.36 --> 4099.36
 What are you fantasizing about?

995
4102.36 --> 4105.36
 What do you want me to do?

996
4105.36 --> 4108.36
 You have to make me laugh.

997
4108.36 --> 4111.36
 What do you want me to do?

998
4111.36 --> 4114.36
 You laugh a lot.

999
4114.36 --> 4117.36
 You laugh a lot.

1000
4117.36 --> 4120.36
 You laugh a lot.

1001
4120.36 --> 4124.80
 Take off your pants.

1002
4124.80 --> 4127.80
 It's not fair.

1003
4127.80 --> 4132.43
 I did it, too.

1004
4133.43 --> 4141.58
 I didn't do it.

1005
4141.58 --> 4148.46
 You can touch it more.

1006
4159.70 --> 4165.23
 Are you embarrassed to be seen?

1007
4165.23 --> 4168.23
 I'm embarrassed.

1008
4168.23 --> 4171.23
 You can't see it if you crouch.

1009
4175.23 --> 4178.23
 Take off your pants.

1010
4187.24 --> 4192.13
 I'm embarrassed.

1011
4192.13 --> 4195.13
 You're embarrassed, aren't you?

1012
4200.04 --> 4213.89
 You've done this before, haven't you?

1013
4213.89 --> 4216.89
 You've done this before, haven't you?

1014
4216.89 --> 4219.89
 Be honest with me.

1015
4222.89 --> 4228.54
 What are you going to do?

1016
4228.54 --> 4240.22
 You seduce me.

1017
4247.51 --> 4250.51
 Don't move.

1018
4251.51 --> 4275.15
 Do you want to eat two at the same time?

1019
4275.15 --> 4278.15
 It takes time to eat one at a time.

1020
4278.15 --> 4281.15
 How is it?

1021
4281.15 --> 4292.11
 How is it?

1022
4292.11 --> 4295.11
 It's delicious.

1023
4295.11 --> 4299.81
 You can lick your eyes.

1024
4330.64 --> 4340.30
 Be honest with me.

1025
4340.30 --> 4343.30
 Do you want to open your mouth?

1026
4346.30 --> 4349.30
 You're mean.

1027
4361.95 --> 4364.95
 You're going deeper than you.

1028
4364.95 --> 4373.94
 You're mean.

1029
4385.17 --> 4388.17
 You're mean.

1030
4388.17 --> 4391.17
 You like it, don't you?

1031
4392.17 --> 4395.17
 Do you like it?

1032
4407.83 --> 4410.83
 Does it feel good?

1033
4456.83 --> 4459.83
 I'm embarrassed.

1034
4465.83 --> 4468.83
 I'm embarrassed.

1035
4471.83 --> 4478.64
 It feels good.

1036
4478.64 --> 4483.85
 You're embarrassed.

1037
4500.24 --> 4502.24
 You're drinking it, aren't you?

1038
4509.23 --> 4511.23
 Did you really drink it?

1039
4511.23 --> 4513.23
 I knew you'd drink it.

1040
4519.81 --> 4526.64
 I'll give you the next one.

1041
4550.72 --> 4552.72
 I'll give you the next one.

1042
4560.72 --> 4562.72
 I'll give you the next one.

1043
4586.70 --> 4607.33
 I'll give you the next one.

1044
4609.33 --> 4611.33
 You're not going to do it, are you?

1045
4613.33 --> 4615.33
 I'll clean up for you.

1046
4627.33 --> 4629.33
 I'll clean up for you.

1047
4635.33 --> 4637.33
 I'll clean up for you.

1048
4639.33 --> 4641.33
 I'll clean up for you.

1049
4733.86 --> 4735.86
 I'm sure you'll be fine.

1050
4740.86 --> 4742.86
 I'm looking forward to dinner.

1051
4757.86 --> 4759.86
 Wait, wait, wait.

1052
4760.86 --> 4762.86
 You're hiding it with your hands.

1053
4763.86 --> 4768.86
 Ren-chan, you were laughing when I said you were in a love-hate relationship, weren't you?

1054
4768.86 --> 4770.86
 No, I wasn't laughing.

1055
4770.86 --> 4772.86
 I'm not in a love-hate relationship.

1056
4775.86 --> 4780.86
 I heard there was a surprise from Mr. Sanzaki.

1057
4780.86 --> 4782.86
 So I came here.

1058
4783.86 --> 4789.86
 And I was a little surprised when I was alone.

1059
4789.86 --> 4797.86
 I was wondering if that was the case.

1060
4797.86 --> 4799.86
 I was looking forward to it.

1061
4799.86 --> 4803.86
 But you didn't say anything about your love life.

1062
4803.86 --> 4805.86
 Do you like your love life?

1063
4812.86 --> 4814.86
 I like my love life.

1064
4820.86 --> 4824.86
 I'm a little embarrassed.

1065
4826.86 --> 4828.86
 I'm going to kiss you.

1066
4828.86 --> 4830.86
 I'm embarrassed.

1067
4834.86 --> 4836.86
 Open your mouth.

1068
4837.86 --> 4839.86
 Open your mouth.

1069
4846.86 --> 4849.86
 You open your mouth in a very erotic way.

1070
4851.86 --> 4853.86
 You're back on your feet again.

1071
4859.86 --> 4861.86
 How long have you been wearing clothes?

1072
4863.86 --> 4865.86
 I'm fine.

1073
4867.86 --> 4869.86
 Is that okay?

1074
4869.86 --> 4870.86
 I'm fine.

1075
4872.86 --> 4874.86
 You have a pimple.

1076
4874.86 --> 4876.86
 Too soon.

1077
4882.86 --> 4884.86
 You were laughing when I said you were in a love-hate relationship.

1078
4884.86 --> 4886.86
 No, I wasn't.

1079
4886.86 --> 4888.86
 We have a love-hate relationship.

1080
4891.86 --> 4893.86
 You are on my chest.

1081
4896.86 --> 4898.86
 Your legs are moving, right?

1082
4898.86 --> 4900.86
 Yes, yes, yes.

1083
4900.86 --> 4902.86
 That's fast.

1084
4902.86 --> 4904.86
 It's crazy.

1085
4904.86 --> 4906.86
 Director's legs.

1086
4906.86 --> 4908.86
 Feels good.

1087
4908.86 --> 4910.86
 Feels good.

1088
4910.86 --> 4912.86
 Your hands are open.

1089
4912.86 --> 4914.86
 Open, open, open.

1090
4914.86 --> 4916.86
 How long are you going to wear it?

1091
4916.86 --> 4918.86
 What?

1092
4918.86 --> 4920.86
 I'm done.

1093
4920.86 --> 4922.86
 I'm going to take it off.

1094
4922.86 --> 4924.86
 How long are you going to wear it?

1095
4924.86 --> 4926.86
 I'm going to take it off.

1096
4932.86 --> 4934.86
 It's so cool.

1097
4934.86 --> 4936.86
 There's a lot of boobs.

1098
4938.86 --> 4940.86
 Look at the camera.

1099
4940.86 --> 4942.86
 Yes, yes, yes.

1100
4942.86 --> 4944.86
 You're surrounded by a lot of people.

1101
4944.86 --> 4946.86
 It's happy.

1102
4946.86 --> 4948.86
 It's happy.

1103
4950.86 --> 4952.86
 Are you happy surrounded by a lot of people?

1104
4952.86 --> 4954.86
 I'm happy.

1105
4954.86 --> 4956.86
 Wow.

1106
4956.86 --> 4958.86
 You brought a good one.

1107
4958.86 --> 4960.86
 It's good.

1108
4960.86 --> 4966.02
 It's good.

1109
4966.02 --> 4968.02
 It's good.

1110
4968.02 --> 4970.02
 What is that?

1111
4970.02 --> 4972.02
 Isn't it a real one?

1112
4972.02 --> 4974.02
 The elasticity of the back of the foot is amazing.

1113
4974.02 --> 4976.02
 It's amazing.

1114
4976.02 --> 4978.02
 It's really comfortable.

1115
4978.02 --> 4980.02
 It may be the most comfortable foot.

1116
4980.02 --> 4982.02
 It's a maniac.

1117
4982.02 --> 4984.02
 It's comfortable.

1118
4984.02 --> 4986.02
 Let's change the position.

1119
4986.02 --> 4988.02
 I'm excited.

1120
4988.02 --> 4990.02
 Let's change the position.

1121
4990.02 --> 4992.02
 Let's change the position.

1122
4992.02 --> 4994.02
 I'm sorry.

1123
4994.02 --> 4996.02
 It's close.

1124
4996.02 --> 4998.02
 Oh.

1125
4998.02 --> 5000.02
 What happened to you?

1126
5002.02 --> 5004.02
 What's wrong with the representative?

1127
5004.02 --> 5006.02
 It was an accident involving.

1128
5006.02 --> 5008.02
 The leather...

1129
5008.02 --> 5010.02
 It's fast.

1130
5010.02 --> 5012.02
 It's fast.

1131
5014.02 --> 5016.02
 It's amazing.

5026.02 --> 5028.02
 That's the representative.

1137
5028.02 --> 5030.02
 It's different.

1138
5030.02 --> 5032.02
 Let me smell your feet.

1139
5036.02 --> 5038.02
 Wait a minute.

1140
5038.02 --> 5040.02
 I'll kiss you.

1141
5040.02 --> 5042.02
 You're good at kissing.

1142
5048.02 --> 5050.02
 You were tadilla playing.

1143
5057.45 --> 5059.45
 We've been kissing all the time.

1144
5061.45 --> 5063.45
 I have to do something about it.

1145
5065.45 --> 5067.45
 The representative of the pe nighttime club.

1146
5067.45 --> 5069.45
 The representative of the pe nighttime club.

1147
5069.45 --> 5071.45
 You're a representative, right?

1148
5071.45 --> 5073.45
 You need to be happy.

1149
5075.45 --> 5077.45
 You need to be happy.

1150
5081.45 --> 5083.45
 What do you want me to do?

1151
5087.02 --> 5089.02
 I want you to touch me.

1152
5089.02 --> 5091.02
 Where do you want me to touch you?

 Shoulders.

1154
5093.02 --> 5095.02
 Legs.

1155
5095.02 --> 5097.02
 All of them?

1156
5097.02 --> 5099.02
 All of them.

1157
5103.02 --> 5105.02
 It's getting hot.

1158
5107.02 --> 5120.73
 Ready, go.

 While you take off your pants,

1164
5142.73 --> 5144.73
 I want you to touch me.

1165
5150.73 --> 5152.73
 I'm going to touch you a lot.

1166
5158.30 --> 5160.30
 Look at this.

1167
5168.30 --> 5170.30
 It's been a while since I had a pee.

1168
5170.30 --> 5172.30
 You wanted to do it, didn't you?

1169
5174.30 --> 5176.30
 You want me to do it, don't you?

1170

1187
5318.94 --> 5320.94
 It's white.

1188
5334.94 --> 5336.94

5391.34 --> 5393.34
 Don't let go.

1192

5445.67 --> 5447.67
 Which way did you go?

1196
5447.67 --> 5449.67
 You can't.

1197
5449.67 --> 5451.67
 Don't let go.

1198
5453.67 --> 5455.67

 Let go.

1206
5493.67 --> 5495.67
 Let go.

1207
5495.67 --> 5497.67
 Put your finger in the butt.

1208
5508.92 --> 5510.92

1217
5536.92 --> 5538.92
 I can't.

1218
5538.92 --> 5540.92
 It's the best.

1219

5549.70 --> 5551.70
 We won't stop.

1222
5562.15 --> 5564.15
 Lick her.

1223
5573.08 --> 5575.08
 Is it better to kiss than to put your finger in?

1224
5575.08 --> 5577.08
 That's right.

1225
5577.08 --> 5579.08
 You're all male.

1226
5579.08 --> 5581.08

5589.08 --> 5591.08
 Let's do it in a serious voice.

1230
5591.08 --> 5593.08
 It's embarrassing to say this.

1231
5595.08 --> 5597.08
 Please hold the butt.

1232
5601.08 --> 5603.08
 Which one is the best?

1233
5605.08 --> 5607.08
 Let's do this.

1234
5607.08 --> 5609.08
 Let's do it at the end.

1235

 Does it feel good?

1242
5647.43 --> 5649.43
 It feels good for real.

1243
5659.64 --> 5669.86
 You're so wet inside, Mel.

1244
5679.59 --> 5685.38
 Are you happy to have a child?

1245
5688.38 --> 5690.38
 I'm jealous.

1246
5698.38 --> 5701.38
 I haven't even put my representative in yet.

1247
5701.38 --> 5702.38
 That's right.

1248
5703.38 --> 5704.38
 That's right.

1249
5704.38 --> 5706.38
 How are you two getting along?

1250

 Why don't you lick me? I'm your representative.

1253
5720.42 --> 5721.42
 I have something.

1254
5721.42 --> 5722.42
 What do you have?

1255
5727.42 --> 5729.42
 Lick me, too.

1256
5746.42 --> 5747.42
 I feel good.

1257
5747.42 --> 5749.42
 Who's next?

1258
5751.42 --> 5752.42
 Who?

1259
5754.42 --> 5758.57
 You lick your favorite chimpo.

1260
5759.57 --> 5761.57
 Who's your favorite chimpo?

1261
5777.57 --> 5779.57
 Don't bite.

1262
6821.21 --> 6823.21
 I'm glad you're happy.

 It's delicious.

1280

 I'm glad you're happy.

1282
6922.14 --> 6924.14
 It's really delicious.

1283
6924.14 --> 6926.14
 That's great.

1284
6926.14 --> 6928.14
 Let's feed him.

1285
6928.14 --> 6930.14
 Take more.

1286
6930.14 --> 6932.14
 I want you to feed him.

1287

 You're feeling better.

6987.77 --> 6989.77
 It's a good place.

1296
6989.77 --> 6991.77
 It's a good place, isn't it?

1297
6991.77 --> 6993.77
 I told you to keep an eye on him.

1298
6993.77 --> 6995.77
 It's a good place, isn't it?

1299
6995.77 --> 7001.58
 It's a good place, isn't it?

1300

1323
7403.22 --> 7405.22
 You are flying!

1324
7405.22 --> 7407.22
 What?

1325
