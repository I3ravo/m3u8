1
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Cheers!

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
Cheers!

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
It's been a while.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,791
When was the last time
you all got together like this?

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,300
I don't remember.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Was it 3 years ago?

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,580
No way!

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
How's your husband?

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
How's your husband?

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,000
What did you say today?

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,620
Everyone's at home.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
We're going to play.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,160
Yeah, we're going to play.

14
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:45,520
Yeah, we're going to play.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,240
We've calmed down.

16
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,380
I'm glad you watched this.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,620
It was hot.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm glad you watched this.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,800
It's Japanese style.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
It's quiet.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,340
We were supposed to meet.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,320
It's been a while.

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,540
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,200
Oh, it's been a while.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,500
It's been a while.

26
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,700
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,220
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
It looks hot.

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,241
Can I have a beer?

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Sure, thank you.

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
It was late.

33
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
Hold it.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Hold it! Thank you.

35
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
It's good.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,640
It's good.

37
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:23,760


38
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,140
It's good, isn't it?

39
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:25,141
It's good, isn't it?

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,500
See?

41
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,660
The cutest girl is next.

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
That's right.

43
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,020
Once again, congratulations on
the opening of Kinoko Dousoukai.

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
What's increasing?

45
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,460
What's increasing?

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Cheers!

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Cheers!

48
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,910
It's been a while, hasn't it?

49
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,560
Yeah, it's been a while
since we've seen each other.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
By the way,

51
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
You're alone, aren't you?

52
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Where's Takeda?

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Isn't he here?

54
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,260
Takeda?

55
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,600
Takeda got married.

56
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh, really?

57
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,560
He had a baby, so he can't come.

58
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,120
Really?

59
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,380
I didn't know Takeda was here.

60
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,840
Are you alone?

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Hirori?

62
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,980
Hirori?

63
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,160
Only me?

64
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
I want to see you.

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Cheers!

66
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,340
Where is your girlfriend?

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
I don't have a girlfriend.

68
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,740
You don't have a
girlfriend now? I'm alone.

69
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100


70
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,460
You look so pitiful.

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,520
You don't laugh.

72
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,360
Sorry, you look so pitiful.

73
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,140
I feel sorry for them.

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Are you two married?

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,060
Yes.

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Are you two
married? Yes, we are.

77
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,080


78
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
Everyone knows that.

79
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,480
I feel sorry for them.

80
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,200
Everyone knows that.

81
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,270
Everyone knows that.

82
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,900
Didn't you know
that? No, I didn't.

83
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,520


84
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,740
Didn't you write a
letter? No, I didn't.

85
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,740
You didn't write anything.

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
Then, let's get back on track.

87
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,620
Let's get back on track.

88
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,600
Let's get back on track.

89
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,601
Let's eat.

90
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,080
Can I have a plate of chicken?

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,600
Two plates of chicken, please.

92
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,300
Thank you for the meal.

93
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Thank you for the meal.

94
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,920
It's so delicious.

95
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,860
What are you doing? Excuse me.

96
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,520
Excuse me.

97
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,640
What are you doing? Excuse me.

98
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500


99
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,460
Please take a picture.

100
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,280
You drank too much.

101
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

102
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,300
I drank too much.

103
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,500
You should have drunk more.

104
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,720
Let's go over there.

105
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,090
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
I'm sorry.

107
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm sorry.

108
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm sorry.

109
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
Let's go over there.

110
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,200
Is it okay? It's open.

111
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm sorry.

112
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,950
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,310


114
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
I'm so embarrassed.

115
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,370
I'll take a picture.

116
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,470
Cheese!

117
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,290
Yeah!

118
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,350
Yeah!

119
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,850
I'll take a picture.

120
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,210
It looks good.

121
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,270
It looks good.

122
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,890
Send it to me later.

123
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,610
You look younger today.

124
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,690
No, I'm not.

125
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,691
Are you drunk?

126
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,190
I'm not that drunk.

127
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,690
Really? Wait a minute.

128
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,710
Wait a minute.

129
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:26,830


130
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,110
If you're not drunk, let's drink.

131
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,310
If you're not drunk, let's drink.

132
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,190
I don't want to.

133
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,430
You're not drunk at all, Himori-kun.

134
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,230
Let's drink.

135
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,550
Cheers! Excuse me.

136
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,030
This one.

137
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,970


138
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,930
Drink it all at once.

139
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,870
I'm not good at drinking sake.

140
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,650
Drink it all at once.

141
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,190
This is the real sake.

142
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,590
First, Uesawa.

143
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,730
I, Himawari, will do my best.

144
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:26,490
By the way, do you have a
boyfriend recently? Yes, I do.

145
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,330


146
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,130
So, don't you feel lonely
without him for 2 years?

147
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Lonely? Well, it's easy.

148
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,170
I'm free.

149
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,510
You haven't had a boyfriend for
2 years, have you? No, I haven't.

150
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,530


151
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,570
Why do you know that?

152
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,571
What are you
doing? I'm so curious.

153
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,170


154
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,610
I'm curious about everyone's story.

155
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,490
We don't have a family.

156
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,470
You were serious,
weren't you? Yes, I was.

157
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,250
What are you doing?

158
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm in college now.

159
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,470
I see.

160
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,570
Senpai?

161
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,070
That's it?

162
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,870
I don't think I do that much.

163
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,610
I think so.

164
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,770
How many times?

165
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,430
I do it once a week.

166
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,610
Once a week?

167
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,070
But I'm busy with work.

168
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
I see.

169
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,950
How about you, Suzaki?

170
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,021
I live far away from here.

171
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,410
I see.

172
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,090
So I do it once every two weeks.

173
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,970
Why? Is it because you don't have time?

174
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,850
I'm tired, so I want to go to bed early.

175
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,970
What is your type?

176
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,730
I've never heard of it.

177
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,730
Type? I like girls.

178
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,930
You are late.

179
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,470
I'm drunk.

180
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,710


181
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,350
I like you more than Himori.

182
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,090
Thank you very much.

183
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,430
See you later.

184
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,750
Thank you.

185
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,930
How about you, Inokawa-chan?

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,210
I... I've never heard of it.

187
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,490
I've never heard of it.

188
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,290
I do it once a week, but my
husband does it so many times.

189
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,010
It's hard.

190
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,710
How many times?

191
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,110
About four times a night.

192
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,750
Oh, my God!

193
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,710
I don't have an image, but I do it.

194
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,950
I've gained some physical strength.

195
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,570
I want to try various things.

196
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,090
I haven't experienced it yet.

197
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,870
To be honest, I like your kiss.

198
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,510
How about Maeda-san?

199
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,350
Maeda-san? I don't know.

200
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,810
How bad is it? It's normal.

201
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,830


202
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,810
Normal?

203
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,230
Do you know normal?

204
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,550
I don't know normal.

205
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,790
Himori is a little curious.

206
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,790
I'm curious.

207
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,530
I want to be mature.

208
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,770
I'm curious.

209
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,050
You do that, too.

210
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,730
I'm not interested.

211
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,150
That's all.

212
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,790
I don't know.

213
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,390
Let's see.

214
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,470
We can't see.

215
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,650
We don't see.

216
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,550
We can see what Japanese like.

217
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,750
That's right.

218
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,810
Who do you want to drink?

219
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,010
Who do you want to
drink? I can't choose.

220
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,210


221
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,270
I don't have enough sake.

222
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,311
We don't have enough sake.

223
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,370
Let's drink.

224
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,170
Drink, drink, drink.

225
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,250
Do you want me to drink?

226
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:46,251
Do you want me to drink?

227
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,330
I don't mean that.

228
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I can't drink that much.

229
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Let's drink.

230
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,730
Let's drink together.

231
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,690
Cheers!

232
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,691
Cheers! I can drink it.

233
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,570


234
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,130
Which one is faster?

235
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,150
The one who loses will show it.

236
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
Good!

237
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,990
Out!

238
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,050
Maeda, you should watch it.

239
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,990
Me?

240
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,350
The one who won.

241
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,790
You should watch it.

242
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,050
Me?

243
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,490
You can look back.

244
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,230
Let's watch it together.

245
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,310
No, I don't want to.

246
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,390
Let's watch it together.

247
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:29,950
Are you serious?

248
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,630
Because you didn't drink it.

249
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,170
What?

250
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,570
She looks happy.

251
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,650
She looks happy.

252
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,170
What?

253
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,290
Are you serious?

254
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:51,170
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

255
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,650
Oh, my God!

256
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,870
Oh, my God!

257
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,780
Oh, my God!

258
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
Yurika!

259
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,520
The string is coming out.

260
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,320
I can't tell the color.
I want to see the color.

261
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,240
Look closer.

262
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,440
You can see the underwear, right?

263
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
Did you take it off?

264
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,720
Did you miss it?

265
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Baby?

266
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,120
Did you miss it?

267
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,520
Or is it small?

268
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,660
That's not the case.

269
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Let me see.

270
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,700
It's okay.

271
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,701
Ma-chan, you missed it.

272
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
You missed it.

273
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
You missed it.

274
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Wait a minute.

275
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Wait a minute.

276
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,380
Wait a minute.

277
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,940
Wait a minute.

278
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,900
Wait a minute.

279
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,420
Wait a minute.

280
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,421
It's okay.

281
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
It's okay.

282
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:46,920
It's okay.

283
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:47,921
It's okay.

284
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,670
Wait a minute.

285
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,110
Wait a minute.

286
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:56,430
Wait a minute.

287
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:56,690
Wait a minute.

288
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,691
Don't do that!

289
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,370
I feel like a weird juice is coming out.

290
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,790
This is the one you
ate, so I don't like it.

291
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,050
I don't want to use my juice.

292
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,750
It's cute.

293
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm sure it will come out.

294
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,860
What are you doing?

295
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,020
The result is out.

296
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,320
The result is out.

297
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,130
What are you doing?

298
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,410
Great!

299
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:36,260
It's new, isn't it?

300
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,220
Thank you very much.

301
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,260
It's not over yet.

302
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
It's not over yet.

303
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,040
What are you doing? That's all.

304
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780


305
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,480
Do you lose? I lost.

306
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,060
This is it!

307
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,050
Let's start with this one.

308
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,650
It's been a while.

309
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:08,980
Which one is bigger?

310
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,780
I think this one is bigger.

311
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Oh my god!

312
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,360
You look a little happy.

313
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,300
You look a little happy,
don't you? I'm happy.

314
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,160
You look happy.

315
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:19,580
I'm happy.

316
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
I'm happy.

317
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900


319
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,880
But you are one of us.

320
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Now?

321
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Now?

322
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,920
Now?

323
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,500
What's going on?

324
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,501
Should I stand up?

325
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,460
Yes, you should.

326
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:33,635
I'll take a picture of you.

327
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
Let's take a picture together.

328
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,840
I'll take a picture of you.

329
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,620
It's going to be a dark history.

330
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Cheese!

331
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,540
One more!

332
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Cheese!

333
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,340
Good!

334
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,341
Beautiful!

335
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
I sent it!

336
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,010
Do you want to take a thumbnail?

337
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,250
I want to take it off.

338
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,570
It's getting hot.

339
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,630
It's hot.

340
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,470
I want to take it off.

341
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,570
It's hot.

342
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,070
Excuse me.

343
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,150
It's almost done.

344
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,690
It's good.

345
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,740
It's OK.

346
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,430
It looks painful.

347
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:44,810
The loser of
rock-paper-scissors will do it.

348
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,790
It looks like a funny game.

349
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,570
Let's do it.

350
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,490
Oh!

351
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,230
It's open!

352
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,530
Rock-paper-scissors! I'm going.

353
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,950


354
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,670
Rock-paper-scissors!

355
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:19,530
Oh, really?

356
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,990
Please do it more carefully.

357
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,010
Oh, my God!

358
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,185
Why am I being played a
punishment game? She is excited.

359
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,170


360
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,150
It's a weird sign.

361
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,550
What kind of expression is that?

362
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,050
Does it feel good?

363
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,650
It's really hard.

364
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,670
Is it really hard?

365
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,110
Yes.

366
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,850
It's amazing.

367
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,190
Does it feel good?

368
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,890
It's the second one.

369
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,230
I don't want to do it either.

370
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,110
Seriously.

371
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,430
Wait, wait!

372
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,950
Let's play a game.

373
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,150
What is it?

374
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,890
Do you know the Survivor's game?

375
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,250
What's that?

376
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,490
There are 3 numbers, and
the one who says 31 loses.

377
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,390
Really? From 1 to 10.

378
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,730


379
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,650
What do we do if we lose?

380
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,730
What's the game?

381
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,430
Let's lick each other if we lose.

382
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,070
I'm done.

383
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,610
Let me go.

384
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,790
Really? Let me go.

385
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,510


386
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,410
It's just right.

387
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,830
1, 2, 3.

388
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,130
4, 5, 6? That's right.

389
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,910
I can say up to 6.

390
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,610
4.

391
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,450
Yes, I did!

392
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Look! The second one.

393
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,110
Wow, there are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

394
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,630
You are so happy.

395
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,870
You are happy and cute.

396
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,010
How about the next
one? I was so happy.

397
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,170


398
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,290
Don't be so erotic.

399
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,510
How many? 12? 11? Here we go.

400
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,170
Twelve.

401
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,450
Fourteen.

402
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,430
Fifteen.

403
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:34,270
Sixteen.

404
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,430
Seventeen.

405
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,530


406
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,491
17

407
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,090
18

408
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,850
18

409
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,450
19 20 I'm scared.

410
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,630



411
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,170
How many?

412
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,210
31

413
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,590
21

414
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,450
22

415
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,195
23, 24

416
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,788
25

417
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,191
26

418
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:30,790
27, 28

419
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,250
From 28th...

420
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,400
28th...

421
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,010
Why are you looking at me?

422
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,830
Is 28th okay?

423
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,510
You like it, don't you? 29, 30.

424
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,130


425
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,150
Are you sure?

426
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,290
But everyone can
see it, right? I'll hide it.

427
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,870
Stand up.

428
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,270
This is good.

429
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,430
Go over there.

430
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,150
I can't see it.

431
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,390
Check it.

432
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,846
I want to check the
time. I can't see it.

433
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,870
10 seconds.

434
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,570
What is this?

435
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,010
Is it coming in? Yes, it is.

436
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,770
It's long.

437
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,530
Wait a minute.

438
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,186
I think it's hard
to see your hand.

439
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,510
Thank you.

440
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,511
Say like this.

441
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,650
Let's count.

442
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:43,651
Let's count.

443
00:19:44,480 --> 00:20:13,840
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Why are you taking it off?

444
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,520
It's falling off.

445
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
It's really falling off.

446
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
It's really falling off.

447
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,460
I don't need it.

448
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,320
That's right.

449
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,400
I don't need it.

450
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,401
I don't need it.

451
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,040
2 seconds left.

452
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
That's not good.

453
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,280
Do it if you can.

454
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,020
I can't do it if I can't do it.

455
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,860
Then do it quickly.

456
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
One, two, three.

457
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Nine.

458
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:32,945
Ten.

459
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Ten.

460
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:44,730
Ten.

461
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,370
Ten.

462
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,190
Ten.

463
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,930
Ten.

464
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:51,270
I'm going to show you how to lick it.

465
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:52,271
Everyone is licking it.

466
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,910
I'm going to show you how to lick it.

467
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,730
I'm going to show you how to lick it.

468
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:00,190
I'm going to show you how to lick it.

469
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,890
Where should I
touch? Around here.

470
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,490
I have ice.

471
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,150
You have ice.

472
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,690


473
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,450
I'm going to lick it.

474
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,830
My neck is cold.

475
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,310
Himawari, you can't do it yet.

476
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,150
I can't do it yet.

477
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,630
It's so hard.

478
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:31,631
It's so hard.

479
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,250
It's so hard.

480
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,210
Let's do it.

481
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,650
Himori, I'll teach you
how to play the piano.

482
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,110
You've never done it before.

483
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,690
It fell.

484
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,830
I'm sorry.

485
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,770
No, no.

486
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,970
No.

487
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,130
It's going to be dirty.

488
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,570
This is expensive.

489
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Next.

490
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,466
You've been looking at it all the time.

491
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,250
I've been looking at it all the time.

492
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,890
You've been looking at it all the time.

493
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,470
You're going to do it.

494
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,770
Show me.

495
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,790
Don't say that!

496
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,210
Don't say that!

497
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:33,750
It's a lie!

498
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,450
It's a lie!

499
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,590
It's a lie!

500
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,591
It's a lie!

501
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,930
It's a lie!

502
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,990
It's a lie!

503
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,250
It's a lie!

504
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:47,670
It's a lie!

505
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:47,930
It's a lie!

506
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,710
It's a lie!

507
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,570
It's a lie!

508
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:49,590
It's a lie!

509
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:49,750
It's a lie!

510
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,790
It's a lie!

511
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,090
It's a lie!

512
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,150
It's a lie!

513
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,170
It's a lie!

514
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:57,670
It's a lie!

515
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,810
Wow, something is coming out.

516
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,130
This is the biggest one.

517
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,230
Look at the boobs.

518
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,230
There is no stop.

519
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,730
Look, there are flowers on both hands.

520
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,110
Let's touch here.

521
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,910
Let's play with it a little bit.

522
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,030
Oh, no. It's coming out.

523
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,630
It's beautiful.

524
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,970
Look, it's a butt.

525
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,010
It's a butt.

526
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,530
It's a butt of my beloved sister.

527
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,950
It's a butt of my beloved sister.

528
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,390
It's a butt of my beloved sister.

529
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,391
It's so soft.

530
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,510
It's a little bit erotic.

531
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:00,890
Let's change the table.

532
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,730
I'm scared.

533
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,690
I won't let you drink alcohol.

534
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,350
Show me your butt.

535
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,290
Show me.

536
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,291
Oh my god!

537
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,910
Look! She likes butt.

538
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440


539
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Look! It feels good.

540
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
She is happy.

541
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,120
She is cute.

542
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Me, too.

543
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,170


544
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,330
Look! She is getting on the chair.

545
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,850
Hey, hey.

546
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,510
She likes butt.

547
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:08,970
Look!

548
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,530
Wow! She is happy.

549
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,690
I am happy.

550
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,250


551
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,810
My legs are getting bigger and bigger.

552
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,430
It's amazing.

553
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,920
I like legs, too.

554
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You like everything.

555
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
What's so amazing? Tell me.

556
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,060
Your balls are swimming.

557
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
They are swimming.

558
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
They are swimming.

559
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,120
We want to make you feel good.

560
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,380
We want to make you feel good.

561

00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,300
We want to make you feel good.

565
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,860
We want to make you feel good.

566
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,460
Let me out! Let me out!

567
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
Is it possible to come out like this?

568
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Wow!

569
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,150
You are so mean!

570
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,710
Stop it! Stop it!

571
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,670
Stop it!

572
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,550
You don't want to do it anymore?

573
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,220
I don't want to do it anymore!

574
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:52,421
I don't want to do it anymore!

575
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,900
I don't want to do it anymore!

576
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,920
You are so kind!

577
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,220
You are so kind! Thank you.

578
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,760


579
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,320
Did I make you dirty?

580
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,380
Asahi is full of energy.

581
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,130
What are you doing?

582
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,430
What are you doing?

583
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,770
Cheers! Let's drink.

584
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,551
Cheers!

585
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,390
Are you OK?

586
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,270
Are you drunk? Yes, I am.

587
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,591
Are you OK?

588
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,010
Are you crazy?

589
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,730
I feel like something is wrong.

590
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,170
No one is coming.

591
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,250
Let's lie down.

592
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,810
There is another room over there.

593
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,290
Let's go over there.

594
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,470
Are you OK?

595
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,770
Are you OK?

596
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:59,430
It's better for a man to go.

597
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Let's go together.

598
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,330
It's hot.

599
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:05,850
Hiyori, you go.

600
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,530
Be careful.

601
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,710
Put on your weight.

602
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,470
Sit here.

603
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:18,970
Me?

604
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:19,010
Are you ready?

605
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,750
Yes.

606
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,490
Look, look, look.

607
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,190
You are going to fall asleep.

608
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,790
Are you OK?

609
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,970
Are you going to lie down?

610
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,690
Yes.

611
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,550
Are you sleeping?

612
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,530
Can you see?

613
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,970
Are you sleeping?

614
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:40,350
Well,

615
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,130
Kimori is getting
married, isn't she?

616
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,490
Yes.

617
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,890
I'm worried about my husband.

618
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,230
I'm worried about him.

619
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:52,250
I'm worried about him.

620
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:52,270
I'm worried about him.

621
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,271
I'm worried about him.

622
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,490
I'm worried about him.

623
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,490
I'm worried about him.

624
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
I'm worried about him.

625
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,730
I'm worried about him.

626
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,030
I'm worried about him.

627
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,390
I'm worried about him.

628
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:12,391
I'm worried about him.

629
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,750
I'm worried about him.

630
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,330
I'm worried about him.

631
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:15,610
I'm worried about him.

632
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:17,550
I'm worried about him.

633
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,710
Can you see it?

634
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,230
I touched it, but I can't
touch it a little more.

635
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,190
It's all right. Come here.

636
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,230
It's hard.

637
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,890
It's very hard.

638
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,070
I want to do it.

639
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,010
I can't do it.

640
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:57,670
Here.

641
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,410
You can sit here.

642
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,890
It's OK.

643
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,790
Everyone is here.

644
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,650
It's OK.

645
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:25,470
It feels good, doesn't it?

646
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,770
What is your name?

647
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,930
My name?

648
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,390
My name?

649
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,530

My name?

653
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,330
I'm going to be a weak child.

654
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,510
Really?

655
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,470
Yes.

656
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,390
I'm drunk.

657
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,470
I'm not drunk.

658
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,610
I was just in the mood.

659
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,611
It's just a little bit.

660
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,430
We are different.

661
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,990
Don't worry. It's just glue.

662
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,970
From here.

663
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,670
Can you see it?

664
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,430
Can I put it in?

665
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,610
Wait, wait, wait.

666
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,870
Don't worry.

667
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:50,310
I'm not good at this.

668
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
I'm a little nervous.

669
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,230
I'm a little nervous.

670
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,590

I'm a little nervous.

673
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,770
I'm a little nervous.

674
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,510
I'm a little nervous.

675
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,390
I'm a little nervous.

676
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,490
I'm a little nervous.

677
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,390
I'm a little nervous.

678
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:09,870
I'm a little nervous.

679
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,150
I'm a little nervous.

680
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,190
I'm a little nervous.

681
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,750
I'm a little nervous.

682
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,550
I'm a little nervous.

683
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,350
I'm a little nervous.

684
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:18,690
I'm a little nervous.

685
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:18,750
I'm a little nervous.

686
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:19,751
I'm a little nervous.

687
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,580
Oh, it's hot.

688
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,940
Oh, it feels good.

689
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,080
Oh, it's hot.

690
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,160
Oh, it feels good.

691
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:48,060
It's so hard.

692
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
Oh, it feels good.

693
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,780
Are you doing it? I'm doing it.

694
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,340


695
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:21,970
No, I was massaging.

696
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,490
You are too fast.

697
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,230
No, no, no.

698
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,710
You are doing it.

699
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,430
You should have done it properly.

700
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,990
What are you doing?

701
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,070
Show me the massage.

702
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,270
Show me the massage.

703
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,890
It's in here.

704
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:47,870
Where is the
massage? It's in here.

705
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,250


706
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,630
You are doing it.

707
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,310
It's in here.

708
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,010
It's in there.

709
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,030
What kind of massage?

710
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,970
Hey!

711
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,050
You are doing it, aren't you?

712
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,390
You are doing it,
aren't you? No, I'm not.

713
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,990


714
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:06,990
What are you doing?

715
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,190
I'm not taking a bath.

716
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:10,970
What?

717
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,710
What?

718
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:15,490
What?

719
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:21,530
She was drunk, so I tried
to give her a massage.

720
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:22,930
Massage?

721
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,850
I'm doing it!

722
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,310
I'm doing it!

723
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:26,950
I'm doing it!

724
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,590
Komatsu, are you okay?

725
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,570
Komatsu, stop, stop, stop!

726
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
What are you doing?

727
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,370
What are you doing?

728
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,730
What are you doing?

729
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,750
I'm doing it!

730
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
We're helping Masa.

731
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,270
We're helping Masa.

732
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,590
Massage me properly.

733
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,830
But...

734
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:04,870
Don't do that to a girl.

735
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,270
You can move more.

736
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,430
Be serious.

737
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,330
I'm serious.

738
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,130
Look at this.

739
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,710
I want to take it off.

740
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,650
Let's take it off.

741
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,690
You don't have to do that.

742
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,561
You have to make her feel good.

743
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,410
It's a massage,
isn't it? She's drunk.

744
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,270
Give her a massage.

745
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,070
You said it yourself.

746
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,190
You have to move your hips more.

747
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,270
It looks good on you.

748
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:49,010
You look so good in it.

749
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,910
It's fashionable.

750
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,310
Let's show it to them.

751
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,210
What's so fashionable?

752
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,710
Let's do it in a different way.

753
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,930
Let's do it in a different way.

754
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,350
Show us more.

755
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:36,930
Show me more.

756
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:37,931
Like this.

757
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,910
Show me more.

758
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,310
I couldn't see it well.

759
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,290
Oh my god!

760
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,870
This is a special seat.

761
00:36:57,871 --> 00:36:58,871
Oh, my God!

762
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,050
Look at her!

763
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,630
Does it feel good?

764
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,990
Yes, it does!

765
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,710
Show me your boobies!

766
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:16,711
Show me your boobies!

767
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,950
I think she's used to it.

768
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,570
Look! She's moving!

769
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,450
Wow!

770
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,451
Wow!

771
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,430
Can you move like this?

772
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,510
You just have to train your body.

773
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,670
Let me see.

774
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,990
Your boobs are saying, help me.

775
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,090
I heard it.

776
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,070
That's good.

777
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,990
Let me see your butt.

778
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,410
Let me see.

779
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,570
Wait a minute.

780
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,530
Hello?

781
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,250
We are having fun!

782
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,251
I'm going to the concert.

783
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,700
Is that so?

784
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Is that so?

785
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
OK.

786
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
You know? Yes, I know.

787
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,620


788
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Bye.

789
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
More!

790
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
More!

791
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,380
More!

792
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,640
More!

793
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Come on!

794
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,176
No, no, I'm going to do it.

795
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,720
What?

796
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,820
What?

797
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,480
What?

798
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,660
What are you doing?

799
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940
What?

800
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Wow!

801
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Wow!

802
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:50,830
Wow!

803
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,570
Wow! Try licking it.

804
00:39:51,571 --> 00:40:15,650


805
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,330
It was the best.

806
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,530
It's been a while, hasn't it?

807
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,250
It's been a while, hasn't it?

808
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,550
It's been a while, hasn't it?

809
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,250
You look so energetic even
though you just took it out.

810
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,510
That's right.

811
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,770
You look like you can do it.

812
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,130
You look so energetic.

813
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:45,131
Let's do it!

814
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,490
I want to do it!

815
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,490
Which one do you like?

816
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,450
Which one do you like?

817
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,890
Which one do you like?

818
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,470
Which one do you
like? I can't choose.

819
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,490


820
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,630
Which one do you like?

821
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,430
You want to do it, don't you?

822
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,570
Let's do it!

823
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,050
I have this one, too.

824
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,330
What should I do?

825
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,870
Can't you put it in?

826
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,050
My panties!

827
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,670
Your panties are...

828
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,690
Hurry up!

829
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,330
Oh, no!

830
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,610
Hinata, how do you feel?

831
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,030
Do you feel good?

832
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,870
Hinata, do you feel good?

833
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,730
I'll give you a good one.

834
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:04,731
It's so cute.

835
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,570
Look.

836
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,550
This way.

837
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,810
Isn't it better to go that way?

838
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,620
What's going on?

839
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,490
What's going on? Go away.

840
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,490


841
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,730
It's good!

842
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:48,990
You can put it in your mouth.

843
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,690
Put it in your mouth.

844
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,210
It feels good!

845
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,140
It feels good!

846
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,580
You have a big boob!

847
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Seriously?

848
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Of course!

849
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,206
Why do you think I
called you? That's right.

850
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,520
I'll show you.

851
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,000


852
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,240
You can't do that.

853
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,140
Look.

854
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,070
Let's take it off.

855
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,250
Let's take it off.

856
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,470
Wow.

857
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,510
Wow.

858
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:34,430
Wow.

859
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,590
Are you ready? I'm waiting.

860
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:51,870
Let's do it before
everyone sees us.

861
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,330
Hurry up!

862
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,810
The order may come soon.

863
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,090
Hurry up!

864
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
We are in the way.

865
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,690
What are you wearing?

866
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,150
Show me your legs.

867
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,250
I want to see them.

868
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,730
Show me.

869
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:13,970
Great!

870
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,490
Great?

871
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:15,630
Do you feel good?

872
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:16,631
How do you feel?

873
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,290
I feel like I'm my husband.

874
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Really?

875
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,030
You did it!

876
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,370
I wanted to do it, too.

877
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,490
You did it!

878
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,510
Oh, my God!

879
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:29,270
Look!

880
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,850
Oh, my God!

881
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,830
Oh, my God!

882
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,831
Oh, my God!

883
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:44,760
You can do it!

884
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,220
Give me a kiss!

885
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,740
Oh, my God!

886
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,760
Go for it! Go for it!

887
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:01,820
I have to feel good.

888
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,140
I'm waiting for you.

889
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,720
I don't want to let you go.

890
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,740
I don't want to let you go.

891
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,640
I'm waiting for you.

892
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,120
Next.

893
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,160
I'm tired.

894
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,540
You can still do it.

895
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
Did you feel good?

896
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,780
You can still do it.

897
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,450
Who's next?

898
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,550
You don't want to do it?

899
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,040
You came here and
played rock-paper-scissors.

900
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,560
Let's change.

901
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,380
Next.

902
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,980
It's a bathing suit.

903
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,860
It's a bathing suit.

904
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,540
Take it off.

905
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,500
I'll take it off for you.

906
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,380
Look carefully.

907
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,200
Let's do it until the end.

908
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,600
Do it slowly.

909
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,680
It's not just fast.

910
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:43,640
It's not just the beginning.

911
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,060
I can't hold it anymore.

912
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,960
Wait, wait, wait!

913
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,340
You can still do
it? I'm so glad.

914
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,110
I'm so glad.

915
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:29,850


916
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,850
Where are you putting it?

917
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,310
My hair got wet.

918
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:44,600
Are you scared? I'm scared.

919
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,120
It's about time.

920
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,040
Why? I'm nervous.

921
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,460


922
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:56,070
Don't get too close.

923
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:44,400
You're trembling.

924
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,580
Who is it?

925
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,000
Komachi wants to do it, too.

926
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:53,160
She had a massage just now.

927
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,840
Do it properly.

928
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,060
You should take it off.

929
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Take it off.

930
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,900
I'll take your clothes.

931
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,020
I don't need it anymore.

932
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,240
This way.

933
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,680
Hello.

934
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,460
I can see you.

935
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,140
You are amazing.

936
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,000
Look at your butt.

937
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,340
Kimori, you should drink alcohol.

938
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,220
I feel sick.

939
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,080
You don't have to do that!

940
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,360
Oh, my God!

941
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,060
Wow!

942
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,870
It's hot!

943
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,870
It's better to take a bath now.

944
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,030
Go ahead.

945
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:34,526
Komachi said we can take a bath.

946
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,260
Good for you!

947
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,220
Can you do it
again? No, I can't.

948
00:53:48,640 --> 00:54:19,440
I can't do it anymore.

949
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,020
I can't do it.

950
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,640
I can't do it.

951
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,300
You can't do it with two hands.

952
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,720
I can do it.

953
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,460
What's wrong? I'm hungry.

954
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,440
I feel good.

955
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:17,090
Kimo-Rin, please
move this side, too.

956
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,070
What should I do? It's not good.

957
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,230


958
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:26,280
It's not good, isn't
it? Come here.

959
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,380
Come here.

960
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,040


961
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,666
You can get tired with hot water.

962
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,080
Wow, you're still standing.

963
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Look.

964
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,440
Wow, you're still standing.

965
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,080
You're standing on this side, too.

966
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:39,441
You're standing on this side, too.

967
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,000
Your balls are still tight.

968
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,440
Wow, you've taken it out three times.

969
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Wow.

970
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,610
What are you doing?

971
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,630
You're playing again.

972
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,571
You're amazing.
You haven't taken it out yet.

973
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,890
Can I go in?

974
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,290
You haven't taken it out yet. Look.

975
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,890
Wow.

976
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,670
Wow, you've done a lot.

977
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,790
Why are you standing
like this? Let's see.

978
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,210
Look at this.

979
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,530


980
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,250
Wow.

981
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,570
It's cool.

982
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:41,870
Wow.

983
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,390
It feels good.

984
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,530
Look at this.

985
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,810
Wow.

986
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,670
It's cute.

987
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:51,550
It feels good.

988
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:52,870
Really?

989
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,550
Can I hold it? Let me hold it.

990
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,170
Let me hold it.

991
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,190


992
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:05,670
What are you doing?

993
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,010
You just did it.

994
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,120
Are you still grumpy?
Look, Hikonori.

995
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
I can't do it.

996
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,881
You can't do it? It's painful.

997
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,600
Ochinchi, you are so grumpy.

998
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,240
I'm not grumpy.

999
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,980
You have double boobs.

1000
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Look at this.

1001
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,640
Oh my gosh! It's so erotic!

1002
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:44,040
Does it feel good, Himari?

1003
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,400
Does it feel good?

1004
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,220
Look at her boobs!

1005
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:53,260
Are you still
fine? I'm still fine.

1006
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,320


1007
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,020
I want to pinch you!

1008
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,480
You're good!

1009
00:58:59,481 --> 00:59:01,480
Let's put it in.

1010
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,200
Put it in.

1011
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,500
It feels so good.

1012
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,240
It's warm.

1013
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,660
Look, Himawari.

1014
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,460
I can't see your picture.

1015
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,420
It's gone.

1016
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,430
Look, Himawari's penis is gone.

1017
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:22,910
I want to see it.

1018
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,590
It's gone.

1019
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,550
Touch my butt.

1020
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:30,610
You like my butt.

1021
00:59:38,210 --> 01:00:12,630
You are still playing with Chuchu.

1022
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,770
You are not fair.

1023
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:16,870
I want you to play with Chuchu.

1024
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,270
I want you to play with Chuchu.

1025
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,010
You feel good, don't you?

1026
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:25,560
You are so cute.

1027
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,110
You are so cute.

1028
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,830
I want to make you feel better.

1029
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,041
I want to drink the water.

1030
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,390
Do you want to
drink it? I'll drink it.

1031
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,630
Drink it.

1032
01:02:19,631 --> 01:02:19,710
I'll drink it.

1033
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,151
Do you want to
drink it? I'll drink it.

1034
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,290
I'll drink it.

1035
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,310


1036
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,040
Wow!

1037
01:02:41,565 --> 01:02:42,980
Please bear with me.

1038
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:51,940
It feels good.

1039
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,460
Are you sleepy? You're tired.

1040
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:21,830
I'm glad.

1041
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:35,940
I'm not sure if
I can do it well.

1042
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,940
Here you go.

1043
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:38,941
You're so kind.

1044
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,940
You're so kind.

1045
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,580
Here you go.

1046
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,520
Let's kiss.

1047
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:52,780
What?

1048
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,580
Wow!

1049
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,960
Don't pinch our boobs!

1050
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,040
What's that? I'm sorry.

1051
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:03,041


1052
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:04,680
I was teasing you.

1053
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,680
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

1054
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
Let's go.

1055
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,390


1056
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,180
How do you feel? It's hot.

1057
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,440


1058
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,350
What?

1059
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,360
I can't hear you.

1060
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,720
I don't know what I said.

1061
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,500
She is going.

1062
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,030
Why are you all going there?

1063
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,230
She is going over there.

1064
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:12,830
She is not waving her hand.

1065
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,290
It's a baby!

1066
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,210
Do you want to lick it?

1067
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,350
Do you want to lick it?

1068
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,070
Look, I'm licking the tip of your tongue.

1069
01:06:55,950 --> 01:07:09,830
Are you still a baby?

1070
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:14,550
Why are you still a baby?

1071
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:16,490
I want to lick your tongue.

1072
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:18,670
I want to drink sake.

1073
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:22,870
Let's drink.

1074
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,190
Do you want to drink?

1075
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,330
You're standing up so much.

1076
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,170
I want it.

1077
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:50,610
I want it.

1078
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,530
I want it.

1079
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,230
I want it.

1080
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,250
It's good, isn't it? Put it in.

1081
01:07:59,110 --> 01:07:59,990
Put it in.

1082
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,110
Put it in.

1083
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,230
Put it in.

1084
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,270
Put it in.

1085
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:07,830
I want it.

1086
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:08,690
It's a bag.

1087
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,310
It's time to go to bed.

1088
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,530
Hey, Himari.

1089
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,710
Go to bed.

1090
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:26,130
I feel so good.

1091
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,820
I can't move.

1092
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I feel so good.

1093
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,290
I can't move.

1094
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:56,030
It's getting hot.

1095
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,130
It's getting hot.

1096
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:23,080
I want you to lick it because it's hot.

1097
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,220
Here you are.

1098
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,460
Lick it.

1099
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:29,940
I'll eat it.

1100
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,450
Okay, let's go.

1101
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,140
Don't make noise.

1102
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,720
Don't make noise.

1103
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:45,280
Don't make noise,
okay? It's gross.

1104
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,640
Look at her.

1105
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,580
It's gross.

1106
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,020
It's a monster.

1107
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,720


1108
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:53,520
It's going to go in.

1109
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:54,521
I'm going to cry.

1110
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,880
Don't you want to
lose? Do your best.

1111
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,940
You should go.

1112
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,660
I'll go first.

1113
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,340
Show me.

1114
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:57,670


1115
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,330
My baby is going to be born.

1116
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:09,070
Who wants a baby?

1117
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,071
Who wants a t-shirt?

1118
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,070
Look, look!

1119
01:15:18,925 --> 01:15:25,770
I'm going to put it in.

1120
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,970
I'm going to put it in.

1121
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:40,960
I wore it once.

1122
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:41,020
I was surprised.

1123
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:41,640
Really?

1124
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,860
Yes.

1125
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,180
But you are doing well.

1126
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,880
I want to get on the car.

1127
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,800
It's good, isn't it? Oh, my.

1128
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,680
I'm glad.

1129
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,480


1130
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,140
Can I try? Oh, my.

1131
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,600
Oh, my.

1132
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,360
Oh, my.

1133
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,480


1134
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:36,980
You are so energetic.

1135
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,940
You like boobs.

1136
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:41,790
Oh, my.

1137
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,140
Oh, my.

1138
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,560
Oh, my.

1139
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,690
Oh, my.

1140
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:45,691
Oh, my.

1141
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,230
Thank you.

1142
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:48,290
I'm sorry.

1143
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:50,570
You should go to bed.

1144
01:17:57,795 --> 01:17:58,800
Hang in there.

1145
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,340
I'm going to sleep.

1146
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,680
I'm going to sleep.

1147
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,160
I'm going to sleep.

1148
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,580
I'm going to sleep.

1149
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,180
Oh, no!

1150
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
Did you see that?

1151
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,041
Are you going to show me your back?

1152
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:18,440
Do you feel good?

1153
01:19:19,130 --> 01:20:07,850
Get comfortable.

1154
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:11,510
I want to do a lot.

1155
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,690
Mirai-chan and Yui-chan, get comfortable.

1156
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:29,210
Look at this.

1157
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:39,550
Where is she?

1158
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,220
She's very excited and
is drinking hot water.

1159
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:38,120
I'll pour it for you.

1160
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:47,190
Wow, it's delicious!

1161
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,510
Really?

1162
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:53,130
It's delicious, isn't it?

1163
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:56,190
What are you eating?

1164
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:58,610
Are you still talking?
You're amazing.

1165
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,170


1166
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:02,930
I'm still talking.

1167
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:03,931
You are still talking?

1168
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,970
It's impossible.

1169
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,890
Wait a minute.

1170
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,370
Break time?

1171
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:22,420
I'm already full.

1172
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,140
It was delicious.

1173
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
It was the best.

1174
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,996
There are a lot of things to talk about.

1175
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,020
That was delicious.

1176
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,300
It was very delicious.

1177
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,560
What's this?

1178
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,360
Oh, I have a good one.

1179
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:40,940
What's that? That is.

1180
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
..

1181
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:44,501
This.

1182
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,860
What's that?

1183
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:47,700
What's that?

1184
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,760
No, it's popular overseas.

1185
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,300
It's like a supplement.

1186
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,660
Supplement?

1187
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:54,980
Isn't it popular today?

1188
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,040
What's that? It's fun.

1189
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,270


1190
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,840
It's fun?

1191
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,860
It's not dangerous at all.

1192
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,480
It's quite popular overseas.

1193
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,540
I want to try it.

1194
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,400
I want to try it.

1195
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,760
It's delicious.

1196
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:21,740
It's delicious, isn't it?

1197
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,960
It's very delicious.

1198
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,780
Look, Suzaki-san.

1199
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,500
Let me see.

1200
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,040
Look, it's staring at each other.

1201
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,280
Do you want it?

1202
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,460
But it's really warm.

1203
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,900
It's warm.

1204
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,721
You can tell the difference.

1205
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,960
It's quick.

1206
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,320
How is it?

1207
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,536
It looks like it's going to blow up.

1208
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,560
It's going to blow up.

1209
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,800
It's so warm.

1210
01:23:49,801 --> 01:23:50,940
Yes, that's right.

1211
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,020
Here you are.

1212
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,700
Here you are.

1213
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,260
Here you are.

1214
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:57,840
Here you are.

1215
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,620
I'm getting sleepy.

1216
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,940
I'm sleepy.

1217
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,540
I'm sleepy.

1218
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,140
I don't need it.

1219
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,740
Here you are.

1220
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,420
I'm sleepy.

1221
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,780
You can do it here.

1222
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,260
I want you to get used to it.

1223
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,280
I want you to get used to it.

1224
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:16,321
What do you want
me to do? Everyone.

1225
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,440
Everyone.

1226
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:19,740


1227
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,100
She wants you to do it.

1228
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,600
Yes.

1229
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,120
Do it.

1230
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,420
No.

1231
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:28,060
No.

1232
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,220
No.

1233
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:30,500
No.

1234
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:31,040
No.

1235
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:31,840
No.

1236
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,360
No.

1237
01:24:32,361 --> 01:24:33,361
No.

1238
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,040
No.

1239
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,200
No.

1240
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,480
No.

1241
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,140
No.

1242
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:41,670
No.

1243
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:42,860
No.

1244
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:43,420
No.

1245
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,540
No.

1246
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,660
It's so hot.

1247
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,200
This is not good.

1248
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,380
It's on my nipples.

1249
01:24:52,905 --> 01:24:54,240
It's getting hot.

1250
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,080
Is it hot?

1251
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,620
I can't do it anymore.

1252
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:05,140
It's getting hot, isn't
it? Wait a minute.

1253
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,480


1254
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,020
What's wrong with you?

1255
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,940
You are sweating a lot.

1256
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,440
You are sweating a lot.

1257
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,080
You are weak.

1258
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,420
You are weak.

1259
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,890
I'm sorry.

1260
01:26:57,270 --> 01:28:51,730
I feel great.

1261
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:33,030
Let's open it.

1262
01:33:43,110 --> 01:35:56,510
I'm sorry.

1263
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,050
Wait.

1264
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,860
I think it's better to put it together.

1265
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:13,350
Be careful.

1266
01:37:13,850 --> 01:38:35,180
Oh, no.

1267
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,380
Oh, no. I can't stand it.

1268
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:10,730
Open it more.

1269
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:12,770
More, more.

1270
01:41:12,771 --> 01:41:38,280
What's wrong?

1271
01:57:30,290 --> 01:58:03,930
You are so cute.

1272
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:09,070
You are so cute, aren't you?

1273
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:23,080
You are so beautiful.

1274
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:30,990
You are so cute.

1275
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:34,150
You are so cute.

1276
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:37,070
Thank you for watching!
