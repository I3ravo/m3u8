1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,820
How do you feel? I was bullied.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,670


3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,350
Is it your first time to come here?

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,130
It's your first time.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
Are you nervous? Don't bully me.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,510


7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,550
Do you drink alcohol?

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,530
Have you drunk?

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,050
I want you to bully me.

10
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:29,830
I'm so shy.

11
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:30,831
You are shy, aren't you?

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,110
Surprisingly, they are normal.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm normal, too.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,190
Are you excited?

15
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,191
Do you want to kiss?

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,670
Let's have a lot of fun today.

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,230
What kind of things do
you like? You came again.

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,590
I'm so tired.

19
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,591
I'm fine.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm so tired.

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,550
I'm so tired.

22
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,590
I feel dizzy.

23
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,270


24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,190
Can I take it out?

25
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,360
Can you open the white one?

26
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,361
Can you open it?

27
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:55,260
This is a serious situation.

28
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,090
Stretch your arms.

29
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,770
Yesterday? You did a lot.

30
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,890
I'm scared.

31
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,090


32
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,420
What does it feel like to have a dream?

33
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:45,380
That's what it feels like.

34
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,360
Does it feel good because it hurts?

35
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,980
It doesn't hurt, does
it? No, it doesn't.

36
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260


37
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,060
It's funny, though.

38
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
How about this?

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
It's funny, isn't it?

40
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm taking a lot today.

41
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
It's funny, isn't it?

42
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,420
Hey, what are you doing?

43
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,140
What are you doing?

44
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,940
It's funny, isn't it?

45
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
What are you doing?

46
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,280
What are you doing?

47
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,060
Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,640
Kojo is a pervert,
isn't he? It hurts.

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,150


50
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,510
It hurts, doesn't it?

51
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,690
It's better to be touched.

52
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:08,420
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

53
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,980
The baby's crying is so cute.

54
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,720
The baby's crying is so cute.

55
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,180
Let me know when you
want me to pet your boobies.

56
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,300
I don't like it.

57
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,720
You don't like it, do you?

58
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,620
You don't like it, do you?

59
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:58,460
You don't like it,
do you? I'm sorry.

60
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320


61
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,340
I can see a lot.

62
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:22,790
I can see a lot.

63
00:09:46,930 --> 00:10:24,040
I can see a lot.

64
00:10:33,140 --> 00:11:02,320
I'm sorry.

65
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:16,020
Mom, I'm hungry.

66
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,180
I'm hungry.

67
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I'm hungry.

68
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I'm hungry.

69
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm hungry.

70
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,340
I'm hungry.

71
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,820
What should I do?

72
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Please don't change.

73
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,920
That's right. I have no choice
but to change. I have to do my best.

74
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,800
Do I have to do my best?

75
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Yes.

76
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,650
It's disgusting.

77
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,610
I wonder if I can touch it.

78
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:20,540
I wonder if I can touch it.

79
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,530
I'm going to do my best.

80
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,790
I'm going to do my best.

81
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,350
I'm going to do my best.

82
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:00,351
I'm going to do my best.

83
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,710
You are so kind.

84
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,050
I'm a pervert.

85
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,870
I got a key.

86
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,970
I'm going.

87
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,280
Oh, my!

88
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,340
Wow!

89
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
What is this? I can't do it.

90
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:03,860


91
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,360
Oh, my!

92
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Great! It's so fast.

93
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,280
It's on the screen.

94
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
It's on the screen.

95
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Hey, hey.

96
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,020
Are you recording already?

97
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Isn't it fast? Hey, it's fast.

98
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,720
Hey, stop it.

99
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:47,970
I'm sorry.

100
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,130
I'm greedy.

101
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:54,131
I'm sorry.

102
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,270
I'm sorry.

103
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
I'm sorry.

104
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,110
It's very hard.

105
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,830


106
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,130
I want to sleep there, but I can't.

107
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,870
Can you sleep there?

108
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,050
She is sleeping.

109
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,330
She looks sleepy.

110
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
She looks sleepy.

111
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,760
I'm scared.

112
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm scared.

113
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,870
I'm not good at this.

114
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,150
I'm not good at this.

115
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:22,330
I'm not good at this.

116
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:29,290
I can't do it.

117
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:42,530
I can't do it.

118
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:53,910
I can't do it.

119
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,415
Crying

120
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:01,590
Crying Crying Crying Crying I have to
go somewhere, but I can't go anywhere.

121
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,940
I love you.

122
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,100
I love you so much.

123
00:19:40,080 --> 00:20:19,350
I love you so much.

124
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,380
I'm so tired.

125
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,381
Do it from behind.

126
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,300
It's dangerous.

127
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm so tired.

128
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,890
Did you do it again?

129
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:12,070
Did you take a
shower? Yes, I did.

130
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,730


131
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,490
Did you take a
shower? Yes, I did.

132
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,230
Did you feel refreshed?

133
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,750
Yes.
