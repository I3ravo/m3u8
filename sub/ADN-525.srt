1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Hello, Mew?

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,910
What are you doing?

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,541
You said you would
come back this afternoon.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,690
Hey, hello?

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,130
Hey, honey.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
I...

7
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,870
I can't go back to you anymore.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,810
Because... I...

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,810
With my colleagues...

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,316
This summer, I came to a
one-night trip with the men of a

11
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:46,950
small IT equipment sales
company that I work as a dispatcher.

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,877
The department we belong
to seems to be making a lot

13
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:01,710
of money in this area, and
the head office paid for it.

14
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,711
That's how it is.

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm so tired.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,660
Really?

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
Then,

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,500
do you want to do it today?

19
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:25,200
Huh? What?

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,090
What do you mean?

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,660
Making a baby?

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
Ah...

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,420
I think my back hurts a little.

24
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,830
Well... It's about time
for me to have a baby.

25
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,871
It's only a few days away.

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,010
You don't have to rush.

27
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,245
I'll do it by the time you're 35.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,490
I'm going to bed.

29
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,310
3 years after marriage.

30
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,350
My husband's salary was good.

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,750
I didn't have any problems with my life.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,970
But my desire to have a
child was against my will.

33
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:15,570
My husband couldn't take it, and I
was embarrassed, but I was full of desire.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,970
I started working as a dispatcher a
year ago, hoping to change my mood.

35
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,910
Thank you very much.

36
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,110
This is the dispatcher's office.

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,070
Please come in.

38
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,230
It's nice.

39
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,970
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,530
It's great.

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,650
It's amazing.

42
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,350
I'm going to kill my parents-in-law.

43
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,290
This is a good one.

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,510
Then I'll put the tea in.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
I'll help you.

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,750
You don't have to do that.

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,870
It's a trip, so make it easy.

48
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,010
But Miyu-San is a good woman who
is serious and thoughtful, isn't she?

49
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,610
No, I don't think so.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,350
Mr. Takemoto, that kind
of thing is like Morahara.

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,550
What? Is it harassment just by praising?

52
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,130
Well, I'm sorry to invite
you on a trip all of a sudden.

53
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:32,131
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,870
No.

55
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,351
It's a trip with people
who are taking care of me.

56
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,240
I'm glad to hear that.

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,670
That's good.

58
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,971
Take your time as your husband says.

59
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,010
Yes.

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,330
Then, it's time for dinner.

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,650
Would you like to come
to this room at 19 o'clock?

62
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,690
Yes.

63
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,310
Then, it's time to use the open-air bath.

64
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,930
From now until 19 o'clock, women.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,541
After that, men are
allowed to stay until 10 P.M.

66
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,790
After that, you are allowed to
have sex, so please be careful.

67
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,450
Sex?

68
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,981
Are there any other customers?

69
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,050
No, today, only you
are allowed to have sex.

70
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,390
Oh, I see.

71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
Shiromine-San,

72
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,350
why don't you go take a bath?

73
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,746
You must be tired to come all the way here.

74
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,130
Is it okay?

75
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,350
Of course.

76
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,351
Of course.

77
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,130
Then, I'll prepare your yukata right away.

78
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,190
I'll do as you say.

79
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,950
This way, please.

80
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,030
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

81
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,530
Chief, the reception
from the office is bad.

82
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,910
Chief, are you listening?

83
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,890
Shut up!

84
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:02,891
I can't believe it.

85
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,710
It was terrible, wasn't it?

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,601
We were all in the company's debt.

87
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,570
But you stole the company's
money and ran away.

88
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Shut up!

89
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,810
We've been working hard.

90
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,350
That's how we were treated.

91
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,070
It's only 5 million bucks. It's cheap.

92
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,406
What the hell are you talking about?

93
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,130
But if we don't do
anything, we'll be arrested.

94
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,990
Shut up!

95
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,950
You'll feel better if you drink alcohol.

96
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,550
Are you sure about Miyu?

97
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,170
Yes, you said you like her.

98
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,350
Yes, but she's not a bad person.

99
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:57,470
You guys don't know anything, do you?

100
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,350
That woman is...

101
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:06,560
That woman is...

102
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,080
She's not the kind of woman who does
delivery oil at home with a cheap salary.

103
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,180
Her husband is a famous businessman
in the city and an elite who works hard.

104
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:23,660
He's an elite, beautiful,
and he's got a lot of money.

105
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:29,080
But why do you think he's
working with a cheap guy like us?

106
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,920
It's to look down on us
and be enthralled by us.

107
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:48,540
Besides, a woman who lives such a
wealthy life is greedy and unhappy.

108
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,720
That's why...
Hehehehehehehehehehe.

109
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,500
Ahhhhh.

110
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,180
Oh, Shiromine-San
You took a long time.

111
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Sorry, but I started earlier I'm
sorry, the hot water was really good.

112
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Oh, I see.

113
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,220
How about a drink, Shiromine-San?

114
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,440
I don't drink alcohol A little.

115
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Really?

116
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,260
But it's easy to drink.

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,640
Take a sip.

118
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,540
Well, thank you.

119
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:50,190
It's good.

120
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,310
Right?

121
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,950
More, more.

122
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
A little.

123
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,230
Thank you.

124
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,930
Oh, that's good.

125
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,460
No, no.

126
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
You're happy, right?

127
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,070
Yes.

128
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Hiromine,

129
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
you're quite a talker.

130
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,400
No, I'm not.

131
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,400
Director,

132
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
since we're so lucky,

133
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,880
let's play a game.

134
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Ta-da!

135
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
The King's Game.

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
You!

137
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,940
The King's Game?

138
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
That's not good.

139
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,340
But you've done it before, haven't you?

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,561
Kissing someone you don't like.

141
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
That's nice.

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
I want you to kiss me, Miyu.

143
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,940
Well...

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
If it's just a cheek...

145
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
That's nice.

146
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
Let's get started.

147
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
Let's do it.

148
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Who wants to go first?

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Miyu?

150
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Go ahead.

151
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,210
Who is the king?

152
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,520
Who is the king?

153
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Yes.

154
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:23,060
Well, it's the first time, so
let's go lightly for the first time.

155
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,020
Let's go easy on this one, shall we?

156
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,480
Okay, number one...

157
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,920
...will massage number three's shoulders.

158
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,920
Who's number one?

159
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,680
It's me.

160
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh!

161
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
Number three is me!

162
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm so jealous of you, boss!

163
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,580
Okay, I'll massage your shoulders.

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,020
Oh, that's good.

165
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,021
Good, good.

166
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,730
It feels good.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is this okay?

168
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,140
Yes, it is.

169
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,630
Is it done?

170
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,760
Yes, it is.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,020
Isn't it too early?

172
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,260
Let's eat.

173
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,760
Let's eat.

174
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:20,500
Who is the king?

175
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,230
It's me.

176
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,440
What should I do?

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,160
Should I say my name?

178
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Shiromine-San.

179
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Kiss Takimoto-kun.

180
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,570
Is it okay?

181
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
It's okay.

182
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,420
Kiss him.

183
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,080
On the cheek?

184
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm scared.

185
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,560
Hurry up and kiss me.

186
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,500
That's nice.

187
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,400
Who's the king?

188
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,880
It's me again.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,260
I'm going to be a master of war.

190
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm going to be a master of war.

191
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,020
I'm going to be a king forever.

192
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,780
Okay.

193
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,160
I have an idea.

194
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
What?

195
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,960
Usagi-kun.

196
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,100
Usagi-kun, kiss Shiomine-San.

197
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,860
What?

198
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,320
Listen to me.

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll never do that.

200
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Deep kiss.

201
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
No.

202
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,980
Deep kiss.

203
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,340
Show me your tongue.

204
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Show me your tongue.

205
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,060
Let's move on to the next one.

206
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,900
Sachi-kun and Tanimoto-kun.

207
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,900
Both of you have to suck
on Shiromine-San's breasts.

208
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
Me?

209
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,540
The king will say it.

210
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,660
The king will say it.

211
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,760
The king will say it.

212
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:30,160
Please don't.

213
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,980
King, can I kiss you while watching?

214
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
No, I won't.

215
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
The king will say it.

216
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,380
The king will say it.

217
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
The king will say it.

218
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,420
No, I won't.

219
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:49,740
I'll make him drink sake.

220
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Good.

221
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll do it.

222
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
You do it.

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,520
Come on.

224
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,260
Come on.

225
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,261
Hiromiya.

226
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Open your mouth.

227
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,940
Good boy.

228
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:15,840
Good boy.

229
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
You are so colorful.

230
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
Next,

231
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,800
I'll make Tanimoto drink sake.

232
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
I'll make Tanimoto drink sake.

233
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:30,200
You are... You are...
How do you feel?

234
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,360
Here you are.

235
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:34,620
Here you are.

236
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
Because there are low-ranking officials.

237
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,580
Next, Saki-kun.

238
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Time-bending boobs.

239
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,120
Akimoto-kun is stepping.

240
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,540
Please don't do it.

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I'll take it off.

242
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Please don't do it.

243
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
The king is the first one to do it.

244
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,880
I'll take it off.

245
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,820
My husband is here.

247
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,400
My husband told you to grow your hair.

248
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
The king will cut your nipples.

250
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,680
I'll take it off.

251
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:32,900
Give me your neck.

252
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Give me your neck.

253
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Give me your neck.

254
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Wait.

255
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,520
Wait.

256
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
Open your legs.

257
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm thinking about the people.

258
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:11,380
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, I know.

260
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Let's drink Wakame sake.

261
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Wakame sake?

262
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,260
I'll make you sleep.

263
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Wait.

264
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
Please stop.

265
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,720
Where are you going?

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,060
The king's order.

267
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
He's a good man.

268
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,401
It's good, isn't it?

269
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,140
I'll show you the king's butt.

270
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,340
Stop it.

271
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
I'll show you the king's butt.

272
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,920
Show me your butt.

273
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,520
It's the king's order.

274
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,660
I'll help you.

275
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:47,740
I'll help you.

276
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,480
Listen to the king's order.

277
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,860
Lie down.

278
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:58,080
It smells good.

279
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,980
The king is going to smell it.

280
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,140
It smells good.

281
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
It's strange.

282
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,200
I feel like I'm in a hot
spring and my skin is smooth.

283
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,060
I'll allow you to sit on the king.

284
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,560
You can sit on the king's throne.

285
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,940
You can sit on the king's throne.

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,180
Rub it on the king.

287
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,100
Don't lie to me.

288
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
How do you feel?

289
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Hiromine.

290
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't lie to me.

291
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,820
Or I'll move.

292
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,320
Sachi.

293
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,660
Give her a kiss.

294
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:06,661
Give him a kiss.

295
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,760
Akimoto, give him a kiss.

296
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes.

297
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,040
The king has been captured.

298
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
Put your legs together.

299
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Good.

300
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,620
Rub the king's face.

301
00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:00,460
Good boy.

302
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:05,000
Good boy.

303
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:05,020
Good boy.

304
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:07,000
Next, face the front.

305
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Keep your yukata on.

306
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,720
Why are you so shy?

307
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,380
You got wet in the bath, didn't you?

308
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,600
Take off your sleeves.

309
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:35,780
Take it out and cut it again.

310
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,320
This is the right style of our people.

311
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,440
Let's lick together.

312
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,420
Come on, drink it!

313
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:07,421
It's okay.

314
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Drink it, Reiko.

315
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,180
I'm going to drink it, too.

316
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,640
I wonder how much it feels.

317
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,260
No, wait!

318
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,560
Stop it!

319
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,980
Do you like it sweet or bitter?

320
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,620
I don't know.

321
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:37,140
No, I don't want to.

322
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,680
You still don't know?

323
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,020
Tachibana, put on your underwear.

324
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,940
It's the king's order.

325
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
It's an order.

326
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,040
No, I don't want to.

327
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,960
I'll take care of you.

328
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,040
No, no, no.

329
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,840
Sajimoto, Saji.

330
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,360
I'll give you a big beer.

331
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,000
No, no, no.

332
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Tell me the color and condition.

333
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,160
The color is already pink.

334
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,800
It's beautiful pink.

335
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:29,801
You're so cute.

336
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
You're so cute.

337
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
You're so cute.

338
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,120
Next, tell me how it tastes.

339
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
How does it taste?

340
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,260
I'll give you some water.

341
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,160
Stop it.

342
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,920
It's delicious.

343
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Stop it.

344
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,700
I'll see how you lick it.

345
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Look at me.

346
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,840
You can't say that.

347
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:59,300
I can't say that.

348
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,580
I'll tell you where you are licking.

349
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,820
I can't say that.

350
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,440
I can't say that.

351
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:10,780
It's an order from the king.

352
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,150
Why can't you say that?

353
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,380
You can't say that.

354
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,780
I'll bite your mouth.

355
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
What?

356
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,600
What did you say?

357
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,460
We want to see Shilomune-San's face.

358
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,100
Okay, let's see his face.

359
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Boso-San, please.

360
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,280
I want to look at his face.

361
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,580
You want to look at his face?

362
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,220
Oh, you want to look at his back?

363
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,640
Yes.

364
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:46,280
Oh, Shilomune-San, please.

365
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Please give me away.

366
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:54,080
Please let me look at his face from here.

367
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,320
Can I spit it out?

368
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
I don't want to.

369
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,840
You don't want to, do you?

370
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,980
You can lick the king's nipples.

371
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,380
Lick his nipples.

372
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,200
You can lick more, can't you?

373
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
You are the best.

374
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
You are the best.

375
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,980
You are the best.

376
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:46,310
You are a girl.

377
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,690
You are cute.

378
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:55,090
You are so cute.

379
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,710
How do you feel?

380
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,550
Do you feel warm?

381
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,010
I'm so excited.

382
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,030
Shiromine, look at this.

383
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,570
I'm so excited.

384
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,870
What is this?

385
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,350
What is this?

386
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,330
I'm so excited.

387
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,750
Hiromine-San will eat the meat of Kaji-kun.

388
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,770
I don't want to.

389
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,630
I won't.

390
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:30,631
I don't want to.

391
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,270
What are you saying?

392
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,850
Please talk more.

393
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,030
Open your mouth.

394
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,330
Are you ready?

395
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Open your mouth.

396
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,730
Sashiko, open your mouth.

397
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
Here we go.

398
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,870
It's okay.

399
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,850
Let's take your tongue out.

400
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,050
Take your tongue out.

401
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,120
Do you want me to fix it?

402
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,460
I'll fix it.

403
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,660
What are you doing?

404
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,540
It's okay.

405
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,120
Let me see your tongue.

406
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,660
Okay.

407
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Let me see your tongue.

408
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,640
Let me taste it.

409
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:58,921
I can feel the taste of the cat.

410
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,280
This beautiful woman touched the cat.

411
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,580
Come on.

412
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Hey, you guys.

413
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,800
It's time for the king to go.

414
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,040
It's time for the king to go.

415
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Come on.

416
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,180
I'm making good use of the new microphone.

417
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:13,300
Dad, where are you going?

418
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,980
Here, here, here.

419
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,500
I was told to lie down here.

420
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,680
That's so gross.

421
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,760
You're so gross.

422
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:47,761
I know.

423
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm so pissed off.

424
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,220
I'm so pissed off.

425
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,440
Look, it's in your cheek.

426
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,400
Ok, Tachiboto-kun.

427
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,640
Sachi-kun, you sleep here.

428
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,540
You two sleep side by side.

429
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,640
Ok, Shiromine-kun.

430
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,020
You sleep between the two of them.

431
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Ok.

432
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,900
You have to shower them one by one.

433
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Ok, this hand, this hand.

434
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,860
It's a good thing.

435
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:39,861
It's a good thing.

436
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
It's really good.

437
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,120
This massage is the best.

438
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Let's do it alternately.

440
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Let's do it alternately.

441
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,400
Let's do it alternately.

442
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,060
You're right.

443
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Let's go.

444
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,160
You're right.

445
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
You're right.

446
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:20,640
Let's go home.

447
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,640
You're right.

448
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,660
Let's go home.

449
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:30,661
It's a little hard.

450
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
It's a little hard.

451
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,190
Don't stop.

452
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,590
Don't stop.

453
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,630
Don't stop.

454
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,590
I'll give you a little more.

455
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,680
I'll give you a little more.

456
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:49,450
I'll take it.

457
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:55,590
First of all, you have to
drink sake while you do it.

458
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,950
Swallow it while it's still in your mouth.

459
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:32,950
That's it.

460
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:33,951
Oh, my God.

461
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,560
That's it, that's it.

462
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:04,040
Ok, ok.

463
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,820
It's ok, it's ok.

464
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:07,860
It's ok, it's ok.

465
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,000
It's ok.

466
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:33,980
It feels good.

467
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,260
It's not that bad.

468
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,600
It's ok, it's ok.

469
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
It's ok.

470
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Ouch!

471
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:12,060
Dad...

472
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,640
The three of us, just the two of us...

473
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm so sad.

474
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
I'm so sad and sad.

475
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,340
I'm so sad and sad.

476
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:28,421
You're getting drunk again.

477
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
You're taking a bath.

478
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,080
We'll clean it up for you.

479
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,920
It's late at night, so...
Let's go take a bath.

480
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,000
Let's go take a bath.

481
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,540
Let's go take a bath.

482
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:44,541
You're going to be okay.

483
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,240
You're going to be okay.

484
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll be back.

485
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:07,660
Hiromine-San, the kiss I gave you
earlier, how did you feel about it?

486
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,700
Please stop.

487
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,160
Let me do it.

488
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:13,161
I see.

489
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,860
You are so beautiful.

490
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,060
I'm glad to see you again.

491
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,880
You are so cute.

492
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,140
Let's kiss.

493
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,180
I'm sorry.

494
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,660
It's okay.

495
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,680
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,120
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,570
I'm so sorry.

499
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,920
I'm not sure if I can do
it, but I'm doing my best.

500
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,540
I'm glad I was able to do it.

501
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,481
I'm glad I was able to do it.

502
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,620
I'm glad I was able to do it.

503
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,250
I'm glad I was able to do it.

504
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:46,780
No, no, no, no!

505
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:47,781
Do you feel good?

506
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,440
No, no, no, no!

507
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:50,441
Are you comfortable?

508
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,480
No, no, no, no!

509
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:55,440
No, no, no, no!

510
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,810
It's about to melt.

511
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,230
No, no, no, no!

512
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:34,910
No, no, no, no!

513
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:34,930
No, no, no, no!

514
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,150
I'm sure it's a good texture.

515
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,050
No, no, no, no!

516
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,870
Move your hand.

517
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,830
No, no, no, no!

518
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,690
I'm cold.

519
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,170
What's wrong?

520
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,110
I can't stand it.

521
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:53,090
You can't stand it at all.

522
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
What's wrong?

523
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,120
Why are you shaking?

524
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:42,620
I can't stand it.

525
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,120
Give me a kiss.

526
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,150
I'm sorry.

527
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,350
You are feeling it, right?

528
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,450
I'm sorry.

529
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,110
I'm sorry.

530
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,810
You like it, don't you?

531
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,230
I'm sorry.

532
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,650
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,450
Which one do you feel?

534
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,950
The one between your breasts?

535
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,510
I'm sorry.

536
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,171
Do you feel it on both sides?

537
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,970
Yes.

538
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,260
Then, you should also wash your face.

539
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I'm sorry.

540
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,940
You've had a lot of water, haven't you?

541
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,120
Don't say no.

542
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
Don't say no.

543
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,180
You've had a lot of water, haven't you?

544
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,410
Why are you licking me?

545
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,710
Why are you licking me?

546
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
I'm sorry.

547
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,750
Here you are.

548
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,790
Here you are.

549
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,250
You are so good girl.

550
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,500
You have a lot of hair.

551
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:13,501
You're doing great.

552
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
You're doing great.

553
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,020
Do you want me to wash you?

554
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,980
I'll wash you.

555
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
I'll wash you.

556
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,900
You, you shouldn't have done that.

557
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,820
Don't do that.

558
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,860
You shouldn't have poured the water.

559
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,880
Please don't do that.

560
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,380
Please.

561
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,640
Please.

562
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,600
That was a good bath.

563
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,470
Please, no!

564
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,920
No! No!

565
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:18,940
You're so beautiful, I
need to take this off.

566
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:33,300
You're trembling.

567
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,800
Can you feel it, Michi?

568
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,700
Let me get more.

569
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,260
It's hot!

570
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,740
You want to drink more, don't you?

571
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,540
It's hot!

572
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,600
Thank you!

573
00:49:27,330 --> 00:50:27,680
I'm going to close the lid.

574
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,140
It's hot!

575
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,200
Don't do that.

576
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,910
Don't do that.

577
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:41,911
It's not your fault.

578
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,390
It's my fault.

579
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:53,300
It's not your fault.

580
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,520
I'm sure you'll be fine.

581
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:09,330
Raise your head.

582
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,610
Give me a kiss.

583
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,470
Raise your head.

584
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:30,591
I'm going to wash your face.

585
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:36,290
Your hands are beautiful.

586
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,100
I'm going to wash your face.

587
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,420
What?

588
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:52,100
I'm going to wash your face.

589
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:53,101
Let's go.

590
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:33,180
Mr.Shiromine.

591
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,160
We can't hide it anymore.

592
00:56:38,515 --> 00:56:41,540
Our future will be gone in this summer.

593
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,480
We can't run the company anymore.

594
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,900
We were all the tail of the lizard.

595
00:56:52,025 --> 00:57:00,740
That's why I made a lot of money and thought
I'd take you with me for the last time.

596
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:09,580
As I thought, you were
a terrible evil woman.

597
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:15,240
It felt good, didn't it? It's not over yet.

598
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,920
Did you wash it well?

599
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,840
No, I didn't.

600
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,340
You don't have to wash it.

601
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,780
I'm so happy.

602
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,300
Please don't do this to me.

603
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,240
Shiroomi, you pretend to be a quiet wife.

604
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:40,120
You should be more open-minded.

605
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,780
I didn't know you were so open-minded.

606
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,900
No, I'm not.

607
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:53,240
You felt it, didn't you?

608
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,940
No, I didn't.

609
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,020
Let's find out which part of
your body you feel the most.

610
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:04,460
The one who feels the most is the winner.

611
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:05,461
How do you like it?

612
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:18,540
It's the best, isn't it?

613
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:33,100
How do you feel?

614
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:37,060
Chikubi-chan, you are groaning.

615
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,340
You have long legs.

616
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,160
Your legs are surprisingly cute.

617
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,860
You are still groaning.

618
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,110
Your legs are surprisingly comfortable.

619
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,010
You look like a model.

620
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,480
I can feel your butt.

621
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:58,081
You look like you're having a good time.

622
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:07,600
You're wearing these erotic panties again.

623
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,400
You're so erotic.

624
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,140
Let's have a good time.

625
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,780
You can do it.

626
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,121
As if you did nothing wrong.

627
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,390
I'll do it for you.

628
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,470
This is my honor.

629
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,090
I'll make a hole in your buttock.

630
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,770
Can you feel my butt?

631
01:00:55,771 --> 01:00:57,530
You, please don't.

632
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:58,910
Do you feel it?

633
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,590
Here, I made a hole in
your butt using my free hand.

634
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:02,399
There is a hole in the
buttocks that has been

635
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:04,271
used for a long time
and has become beautiful.

636
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:15,670
What does it taste like?

637
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,510
Do you feel it in your buttocks?

638
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,220
I haven't told you yet.

639
01:01:44,221 --> 01:01:44,400
I don't want to hear it.

640
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,200
I'm a woman who can
feel the hole in my butt.

641
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,520
You already said it.

642
01:01:55,445 --> 01:02:03,720
I'm a woman who can
feel the hole in my butt.

643
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,060
You shouldn't be quiet
when I'm licking your butthole.

644
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,340
Can you tell me?

645
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,500
I'll tell you.

646
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:38,430
I can't do it.

647
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,130
I'll tell you.

648
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,331
Your buttocks hurt, don't you?

649
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,790
My buttocks! It hurts!

650
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,070
Your buttocks hurt, don't you?

651
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,590
You are a pervert.

652
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:09,860
I will not let you come here anymore.

653
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,100
I put you in a hole.

654
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,600
You are a pervert.

655
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,300
I'm sorry.

656
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,551
You don't resist to be petted.

657
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,960
I'm sorry.

658
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:37,961
I'm sorry.

659
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,400
I'm sorry.

660
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,940
What's wrong with your hand?

661
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,520
Please lick me more.

662
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,960
I'm not wrong.

663
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:58,540
I'll lick you when I'm with you.

664
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,980
I'm sorry.

665
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,780
Tell me that you are a woman
who feels good when you are licked.

666
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,320
I'm sorry.

667
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,720
You are the wife of an upper-class person.

668
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,020
You feel good when
you are licked, don't you?

669
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:31,490
I'm sorry.

670
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,910
Tell me that you feel good.

671
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,830
I feel good.

672
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:36,831
Don't do it!

673
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,760
Don't do it!

674
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:05,560
Which one do you want to be licked?

675
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,190
Or touched by hand?

676
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Which one?

677
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Don't do it!

678
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,100
Or both?

679
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,040
Both?

680
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,420
Both?

681
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:16,920
You want to be licked by both?

682
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:18,220
Oh, you did it.

683
01:05:43,970 --> 01:06:00,910
You are a good girl.

684
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,710
No, I'm not.

685
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:24,300
You said shut up.

686
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,810
Why did you say shut up?

687
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,570
Why are you sweating so much?

688
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,010
Do you feel that you are
touched by a man's hand?

689
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,250
I can feel the poison in your body.

690
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,450
Stop it.

691
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,130
I can feel it all over your body.

692
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,701
Is your body all the same?

693
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:06,390
I can feel it all over your body.

694
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:08,250
I can feel it all over your body.

695
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:08,470
Stop it.

696
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:09,390
What's wrong?

697
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:11,870
My mouth...

698
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:15,610
Look at her.

699
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,370
You're already like this.

700
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,850
Your mouth is full of saliva.

701
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,590
My mouth...

702
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:25,930
It's all over your body.

703
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,090
I can see you're pulling a string.

704
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,830
Don't do it.

705
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,070
What kind of saliva is this?

706
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,770
You're pulling a string
from your salivary gland.

707
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,230
It hurts.

708
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,450
Let's go.

709
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,450
Do you want to go with Manko?

710
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:30,760
It's a terrible pleasure, isn't it?

711
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,140
It's a terrible pleasure to
be touched by a man, isn't it?

712
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:42,380
You move your waist
without moving your hands.

713
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
No!

714
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,530
You've been in a lot of pain.

715
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:34,110
I hope you feel better.

716
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,090
I wonder how far you can go.

717
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:39,890
I'm sure you're in a good mood.

718
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,970
You're in a good mood.

719
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:45,410
No!

720
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,110
No!

721
01:09:49,111 --> 01:09:49,430
No!

722
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:52,250
Massage! Massage!

723
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,370
What? Massage?

724
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:33,420
Why? You don't want a massage?

725
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:34,501
Why are you feeling better?

726
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,040
Because you're a tosukebe, right?

727
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:51,190
Say, I'm a tosukebe woman
who feels better by massaging.

728
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,390
Say it.

729
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:03,770
I'm a tosukebe woman who
feels better by massaging.

730
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,690
Oh...

731
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,830
You look so tired.

732
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,110
Please stop...

733
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,710
I'm not going to stop.

734
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,990
Please stop...

735
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,730
What's wrong?

736
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:41,950
You have sweat on your back.

737
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:48,060
You're a girl.

738
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,340
You're a woman.

739
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,520
You have a good voice, don't you?

740
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,610
What's wrong with you?

741
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,370
You can't feel it, can you?

742
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,810
Oh, you look happy.

743
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,630
You look like you're in a good mood.

744
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,440
You look so happy.

745
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:11,670
You can't stop crying.

746
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,850
He's still sleeping.

747
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:21,851
Let's go.

748
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,350
Can you do it?

749
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,870
Can you do it?

750
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,310
I can do it.

751
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:37,520
oh, my god.

752
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,880
What's wrong?

753
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,140
What's wrong?

754
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,540
It's not a break yet.

755
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,540
Really?

756
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,200
It's not a break yet.

757
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:55,201
I'm sorry.

758
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,280
I'm sorry.

759
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:39,990
I'm sorry.

760
01:14:50,400 --> 01:15:05,440
I'm sorry.

761
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:07,440
Good girl.

762
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,920
You've been so quiet.

763
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,260
What's going on?

764
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,600
You were so quiet.

765
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,080
What's going on?

766
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,460
Why are you so quiet?

767
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,760
You're so funny.

768
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,280
We're going to get a cold again.

769
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,740
I'm sorry.

770
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:37,450
You shouldn't be out of
breath even if you're funny.

771
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,250
Oh?

772
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:47,390
Oh!

773
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,210
Oh!

774
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,490
Oh!

775
01:16:58,990 --> 01:16:59,270
Oh!

776
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:00,690
You're all wet.

777
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:02,530
Oh!

778
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,550
Help me!

779
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,590
Oh!

780
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,140
Help me!

781
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:12,770
Oh!

782
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:22,440
You are so cute.

783
01:17:22,441 --> 01:17:23,441
You are so cute.

784
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,670
You are so cute.

785
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:50,750
You like it, don't you?

786
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,870
I'm sorry.

787
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:30,200
You don't resist at all.

788
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,360
You want to do it yourself.

789
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:54,410
You can do it You can do it.

790
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,610
Good, good.

791
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:03,030
What are you doing?

792
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:03,650
What are you doing?

793
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:05,650
I'm going to put it in.

794
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,730
You are a clumsy woman.

795
01:21:38,740 --> 01:22:01,220
I'm going to put it in.

796
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,920
I was bullied by my boyfriend.

797
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,880
You are a good girl.

798
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:16,270
You are a good girl.

799
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:23,060
You are a good girl.

800
01:23:23,061 --> 01:23:24,261
I was bullied by my boyfriend.

801
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,160
Don't cry.

802
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:33,100
His upper and lower mouth are being combed.

803
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,040
His upper and lower mouth are being combed.

804
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,060
He is being combed.

805
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,760
It feels good, right?

806
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,770
I'm not going to let you go.

807
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:52,310
You're in a bad mood again.

808
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:55,711
You're in a bad mood again.

809
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:01,450
You're in a bad mood, aren't you?

810
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:08,730
It's hot.

811
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:16,450
It's hot.

812
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,120
It's hot.

813
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:19,470
It's hot.

814
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:50,610
I'll give you a kiss.

815
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,980
Are you leaving?

816
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,140
Are you going to go to
the doctor's clinic again?

817
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,820
I'm going to the clinic again.

818
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:31,920
You are eating the cat food.

819
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,000
You are eating the cat food.

820
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:42,680
You are eating the cat food.

821
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,300
Raise your hand.

822
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,060
Raise your hand.

823
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,140
I'm fine.

824
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,120
I'm sorry.

825
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:57,240
I'm going to be late.

826
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:47,920
I'm going to go.

827
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:50,480
I might be late today.

828
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,400
I see.

829
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,980
So, you're not going
to make it today either.

830
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,580
Don't rush.

831
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:01,180
Kids take their time to think.

832
01:31:01,181 --> 01:31:02,181
No, I'm not.

833
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,120
What's wrong?

834
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:08,780
Hey, honey.

835
01:31:09,945 --> 01:31:11,466
What would you do if I cheated on you?

836
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,600
What are you talking about?

837
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:17,361
If I did that...
I'm just kidding.

838
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,080
Well, have a nice day.

839
01:31:24,575 --> 01:31:27,630
I thought I was kidding
when I said I cheated on you.

840
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:36,490
But maybe I was looking for someone
other than him somewhere in my heart.

841
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:39,870
If not...

842
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:10,110
After all, hot Springs are
only in the morning bath.

843
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:16,230
I've been sweating all night, so
it doesn't feel particularly good.

844
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,010
Oh, Miyu-San, you're awake.

845
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,210
How many shots did I shoot?

846
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,470
I don't think you'll be
able to get pregnant.

847
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:35,940
Listen, Miyu.

848
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,560
I'm sure you know this.

849
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:46,800
You've become our
captive in just one night.

850
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:53,480
I'll tell you this, but we have
no place to go back to Tokyo.

851
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,480
Why don't we go somewhere together?

852
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,460
That's a good idea.

853
01:33:05,461 --> 01:33:05,960
I can't believe it.

854
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,480
What?

855
01:33:10,665 --> 01:33:12,940
Even if I go home,

856
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:17,100
I can't leave my husband.

857
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:20,440
I can't.

858
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,260
What?

859
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,220
You're the same.

860
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,381
You've been betrayed by someone important.

861
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,300
We're friends, aren't we?

862
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:39,560
Me, too.

863
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:47,420
Then, let's fall together.

864
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:51,180
Let's go all the way down to the
bottom of the mountain, shall we?

865
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:17,730
Then we'll go all the way down to
the bottom of the mountain, shall we?

866
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,600
We've been doing it all night,
but we're still not good enough.

867
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,250
Yeah.

868
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,140
There, now you can do it.

869
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:58,790
You can hold my face and rub it in.

870
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:00,150
Rub, rub, my child.

871
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:01,650
I'll make you pretty.

872
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,330
You're so witty.

873
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:06,550
What are you doing?

874
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:33,780
You and I have a good relationship.

875
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:35,980
You are a mess.

876
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:41,300
You and I have a good relationship.

877
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:43,061
You two look like
you've been through a lot.

878
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:49,240
Does it feel good?

879
01:35:51,780 --> 01:36:02,590
It's enough, isn't it?

880
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:08,630
Tell me that.

881
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,250
You don't have to cry.

882
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:14,670
I don't have to cry.

883
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:19,890
I'm so happy that I
don't have to do anything.

884
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:20,910
I know, right?

885
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,760
I can hear the sound of
your stomach rumbling.

886
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:10,990
Don't forget your stomach.

887
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,680
Thank you.

888
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,800
Where did you get your finger?

889
01:37:33,455 --> 01:37:37,660
I got my finger in Dosuke's hand.

890
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,560
You are so mean to Dosuke.

891
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,840
I'm sorry.

892
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:50,260
I'm sorry.

893
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,900
(*´∀ゝ∀ゝ∀ゝ∀*).

894
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:35,730
You're so cute, but you're just talking.

895
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:49,170
(*´∀ゝ∀ゝ∀ゝ∀*)

896
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:50,030
Oh...

897
01:38:50,155 --> 01:38:51,970
Oh...

898
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:54,050
Oh...

899
01:38:58,225 --> 01:38:59,225
Oh...

900
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:02,090
I can't believe we've been this together...

901
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:05,070
Oh...

902
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:11,710
Oh... Oh... Oh...

903
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:15,050
I wonder if we still have the last shot.

904
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:39,090
You have a lot of hair.

905
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:45,610
You have a lot of hair.

906
01:39:45,611 --> 01:39:46,611
You have a lot of hair.

907
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:48,710
You have a lot of hair.

908
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,820
Do you like this side better?

909
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:21,030
It's so hot.

910
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:31,170
You look good.

911
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:34,050
Is it good?

912
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,890
Yes.

913
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:37,870
It's good.

914
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:39,551
It's good for your husband, isn't it?

915
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,610
Yes.

916
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:45,050
It's good for your upper and lower mouth.

917
01:40:51,020 --> 01:41:07,420
It's all over your face.

918
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:21,830
Look at the other
person's face and lick it.

919
01:41:29,105 --> 01:41:30,105
Is it good?

920
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:32,850
It's good.

921
01:41:32,851 --> 01:41:35,220
It's better than your father-in-law's.

922
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:38,450
It's better than your father-in-law's.

923
01:41:58,555 --> 01:42:00,970
Don't make me lick your feet.

924
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:18,380
I'm sorry.

925
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,040
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

926
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,930
I'm sorry.

927
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:47,750
You're drooling so deliciously.

928
01:42:49,135 --> 01:42:50,630
Is it delicious?

929
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,110
A little more.

930
01:43:00,111 --> 01:43:03,670
Ms. Mari, don't you know?

931
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:08,710
Here, here, here, here.

932
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:09,910
Here, here, here.

933
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:11,010
Oh, dear.

934
01:43:11,011 --> 01:43:12,011
Oh, dear.

935
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:17,450
Ah!

936
01:43:17,451 --> 01:43:18,970
Ah...

937
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,670
I miss you so much.

938
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:29,291
Tell me, where are you licking?

939
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:32,190
Please say it loudly.

940
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,070
My butt...

941
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,200
He's licking my butt.

942
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,630
I'm touching your butt,
and you're licking mine.

943
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,710
He's licking my butt.

944
01:43:45,711 --> 01:43:47,110
I'm still licking it.

945
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,890
Have you ever licked something like this?

946
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:52,630
I'm still licking it.

947
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:19,270
Let's have a good bath.

948
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:32,870
Let's have a good bath.

949
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:54,051
the other is alas.

950
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:57,110
as this good

951
01:44:57,330 --> 01:44:59,090
hard.

952
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:09,950
for.

953
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:13,830
the.

954
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,120
Steaming struggling

955
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,000
Ah... felt terrible.

956
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:33,280
Ah... super...
Ah... felt terrible.

957
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,340
feels really bad.

958
01:45:40,230 --> 01:45:42,061
Ah... Ah...

959
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,140
I'm sorry.

960
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,060
I'm sorry.

961
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,860
I'm so sorry.

962
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:16,540
I'm so sorry.

963
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,780
Oh, it feels good.

964
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,840
Look at me.

965
01:46:52,841 --> 01:46:54,060
Look at me.

966
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:04,400
I'm taking a picture of us.

967
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,960
Look at me.

968
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:16,040
It feels good.

969
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,820
I'm sorry.

970
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:51,610
You have to sleep.

971
01:47:51,611 --> 01:47:52,611
She is going to sleep.

972
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:46,610
You are doing great.

973
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:50,150
You are doing great.

974
01:48:50,151 --> 01:48:52,010
If your husband knows
this, he will be surprised.

975
01:48:52,011 --> 01:48:53,011
You must be tired.

976
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:03,910
Let's go to the manager's room again.

977
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:13,010
That's right.

978
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:21,490
This side, too.

979
01:50:37,230 --> 01:51:00,540
You'll get better.

980
01:51:40,670 --> 01:52:06,220
I don't know what to do with this.

981
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:19,370
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

982
01:52:19,371 --> 01:52:20,371
What's wrong?

983
01:53:58,370 --> 01:53:59,910
You love Kimpo, don't you?

984
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:01,350
Yes.

985
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,430
Do you love Kimpo?

986
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:05,270
Yes, I love Kimpo.

987
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:10,470
You love your husband's Kimpo, don't you?

988
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:11,710
Yes.

989
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:13,370
I don't want to die.

990
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:15,790
I don't want to die.

991
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:13,320
I'm going to give it to you as it is.

992
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:25,900
Let's go.

993
01:56:25,901 --> 01:56:26,901
I'm scared.

994
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:37,650
It's okay, it's okay.

995
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:38,651
Are you alright?

996
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,190
It's OK, it's OK.

997
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:46,210
I'm sorry.

998
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:49,970
I'm sorry.

999
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,430
I'm sorry.

1000
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:52,140
Do you feel good?

1001
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,900
I feel good.

1002
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,440
I feel good, too.

1003
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:58,800
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:58:58,801 --> 01:58:59,801
What's wrong?

1005
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:10,180
I'm so sorry.

1006
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:27,530
Hello, Miyu?

1007
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,310
What are you doing?

1008
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:31,406
You said you'd be back this afternoon.

1009
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:34,050
Hey! Hello?

1010
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:36,650
Hey, honey.

1011
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:41,550
I can't go back to you anymore.

1012
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:49,690
Because I had a lot of sex
with the guys at the company.

1013
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:54,729
I've had a lot of sex, so
I've been reminded of the

1014
01:59:54,741 --> 01:59:59,790
joy of being a woman by
these people more than you.
