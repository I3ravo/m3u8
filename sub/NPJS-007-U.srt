1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,900
Kanna-san Kanna-san
You are Kanna-san, right?

2
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Yes.

3
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,530
Who are you?

4
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,990
I'm Sana-san's junior.

5
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,510
Today, Sana-san will...

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,130
Kanna-san will come.

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,710
So...

8
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,486
She said she wanted to start first.

9
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,110
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,450
You know...

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,030
Wait a minute.

12
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,650
I've heard that you have an erotic wife.

13
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,830
No, no, no.

14
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:15,210
I've heard that you like her.

15
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,010
You haven't heard
that? No, I haven't.

16
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,390


17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,350
What?

18
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,630
What?

19
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,350
What do you mean?

20
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,850
Me?

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,070
Yes.

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,130
Sada-san proposed to me.

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,690
What? I haven't heard about it.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,640
Sada-san said she would come later.

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,350
Really?

26
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,450
She said she wanted me to be the first one.

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,450
That's strange.

28
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,970
You are beautiful.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,130
Do you like erotic things?

30
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:57,131
Do you like it?

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,670
No, I don't like it.

32
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,710
I heard you are very erotic.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
I didn't know that.

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,830
You started to like it at the entrance
of the hotel, didn't you? Yes, I did.

35
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:17,571
You said you were
happy at the drinking party.

36
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,130
I'm touching it now.

37
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,730
Do you like it? I don't know.

38
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,050
Look at me.

39
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,990


40
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,410
No.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,350
Why not? It's a promise.

42
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,150
But it's okay.

43
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,030


44
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,770
No.

45
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,170
What should I do?

46
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,270
Sada-san told me to take care of you.

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,650
I have to take care of you.

48
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,510
No.

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,121
Did you ask me to take care of you?

50
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,110
Yes.

51
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Why?

52
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,751
She said she wanted
to see something erotic.

53
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,930
Something erotic?

54
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,730
It seems to excite her.

55
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,450
It's erotic, isn't it?

56
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,010
I don't want to touch it.

57
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,260
But you don't look like
you don't like it, do you?

58
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,120
I don't know what to do.

59
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,280
Suddenly...

60
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,780
You have a very erotic face.

61
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:25,781
You look so happy.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,740
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

63
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,380


64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Wow.

65
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,025
You look so happy.

66
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,880
I'm so excited.

67
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,366
Do it like you did the other day.

68
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,700
Do it.

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I showed you the video
I took the other day.

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,220
Did you see it?

71
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:04,580
What are you doing?

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
I was showing off.

73
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,981
I was showing off my happiness by drinking.

74
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
Why do you do that?

75
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,011
I didn't think I would
show it to this person.

76
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,131
I was saying that I had a sexy wife.

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
What are you doing?

78
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,880
I was showing off my happiness.

79
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,021
I didn't expect you to touch me like that.

80
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,700
How can I touch you?

81
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,690
I just had a nosebleed.

82
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,890
I didn't expect you to touch me like that.

83
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:28,470
I didn't expect you to touch me like that.

84
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:29,471
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,480
She is purring.

86
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,150
She is crouching.

87
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,650
Wait a minute.

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,170
Can I contact you once?

89
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,390
Can I contact you?

90
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,050
What?

91
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,730
To whom?

92
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,230
Who are you going to contact?

93
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,050
You.

94
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,130
Why are you going to contact me?

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,510
Because you didn't ask me.

96
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,650
I didn't ask you?

97
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,011
You said you would be happy.

98
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,350
I was surprised.

99
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:27,610
I'm sorry. Can I call
you just once? Sure.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,630
I'll call you.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,590
Oh, excuse me. Kanna-san came to see me.

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,430
Really? That was fast.

103
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,450
He said he couldn't hear
me. Can I talk to him? Sure.

104
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,110


105
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,470
What's going on?

106
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,890
He's a really nice guy.

107
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,491
You should get along with him.

108
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,690
Really?

109
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,470
You should get along with him.

110
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,490
What do you mean?
I understand what you mean.

111
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:25,615
He's not a bad guy.

112
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,790
He's not a bad guy.

113
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,730
He's my junior.

114
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:39,050
I'm sorry, but I think it's
more erotic to be non-daily.

115
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,670
What?
Are you going to do it with such a person?

116
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,390
I've been thinking about it for a while
because it might be better than that.

117
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,810
I've been thinking about it for a while.

118
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,110
Is that so? Why? It's okay.

119
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,890
Just a little.

120
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,330


121
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,610
Will you be happy
if I do that? Yeah.

122
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,930


123
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,010
What?

124
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,770
Is that so?

125
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,510
I'm counting on you. Just a little.

126
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,690
If you don't mind, I'll go later.

127
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,270
Come on.

128
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,310
Come on.

129
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,670
I'm listening.

130
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,490
Come on.

131
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,890
Do you understand? I don't know.

132
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,950


133
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,470
He's been rejected a lot.

134
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,110
Is it my fault? I think so.

135
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,790


136
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,290
Oh, that's what it is, isn't it?

137
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,570
What?

138
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,750
Is it a lie? Well, then.

139
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,490
..

140
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,491
Lily?

141
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,230
Yes, there was something.

142
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,730
Come quickly.

143
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,870
See you.

144
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,990
Yes.

145
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
That's what it is,
isn't it? Wait a minute.

146
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,390


147
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,790
It's definitely strange.

148
00:09:45,240 --> 00:10:02,613
I'm embarrassed

149
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:20,220
sure I'm embarrassed

150
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
You like it, don't you?

151
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,010
It's not that I like it.

152
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
You are so cute.

153
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,900
Why are you making that face?

154
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,180
I don't feel good.

155
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
You don't feel
good? I feel sick.

156
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,260
Sit down.

157
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,720
I feel sick.

158
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,050


159
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:34,980
Don't you feel better?

160
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:35,981
Don't you feel pain?

161
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,540
I don't feel pain at all.

162
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
Why don't you feel pain?

163
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,440
I don't feel pain.

164
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,480
I don't feel pain at all.

165
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:55,940
I feel pain a little bit.

166
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,850
I don't feel pain.

167
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,610
I borrowed this for a while.

168
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:39,211
This is the first time I've heard of it.

169
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,520
No, it's fine.

171
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I've heard of it.

172
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,090
I can't do this anymore.

173
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,510
I can't do this anymore.

174
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,300
I'll give you a shot.

175
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:47,128
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's been

176
00:19:47,140 --> 00:20:11,340
a long time since I've seen a
cat like this, so I'm a little worried.

177
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,083
I'm not sure if it's because it's
been a long time since I've seen a cat

178
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,476
like this, but it's been a long
time since I've seen a cat like this.

179
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
You want it, don't you?

180
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,640
I want you to tell me that you want it.

181
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,790
I want you to tell me that
you want to have a puppy.

182
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,140
I'll call my dad.

183
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,540
I want to have a puppy.

184
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
You want a puppy?

185
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,880
Yes.

186
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:40,881
That's right.

187
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,610
Because I massage
your back, I feel good.

188
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,410


189
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,810
Wow, that's great.

190
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
It feels so good.

191
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:15,930
You have a nice face.

192
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,120
Oh, it's scary!

193
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,100
Oh, I feel good!

194
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,200
Oh, no, no, no, no!

195
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,700
This feels really good!

196
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Huh?

197
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,260
Can I go to bed?

198
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah!

199
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,310
Kana-san, are you going to
move like that by yourself?

200
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:50,090
If you want to move like that,
you have to live, Kana-san.

201
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,350
You really like penis,
don't you? No, I don't.

202
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,990


203
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,610
You didn't like it at first, but I
think it was good for everyone.

204
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,070
I don't like it at all now.

205
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,570
You like it, don't you?

206
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:19,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!!!

207
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,090
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!!!

208
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:23,091
What are you doing?

209
00:25:47,340 --> 00:26:19,040
You can't even see me as I go in.

210
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh!!!

211
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:23,741
Oh!!

212
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh, oh!!!

213
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:53,840
Don't go backward.

214
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,870
Ah...

215
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Ah...

216
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,390
Ah, that feels good...

217
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,730
Yeah, stick out your butt.

218
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,270
Yes, yes, yes...

219
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,600
Sada-san said she'll look at it later, so I
have to take a lot of pictures of Ecchan's.

220
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,340
Is she really going to look at it?

221
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
I won't pick it up.

222
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,760
I'll take a video of you taking a bath.

223
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,770
You are amazing.

224
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
What's wrong?

225
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,700
Tell me what's wrong.

226
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Oh, I see.

227
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
I see.

228
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,020
Do you want me to
kiss you? What? No.

229
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm sorry.

230
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,980


231
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:37,450
Hey, don't do that.

232
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:47,150
I told you.

233
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,570
Put your legs up.

234
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,110
I can't do that.

235
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,390
It hurts.

236
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,570
Oh, no.

237
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:09,705
It feels terrible.

238
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,660
Look at me.

239
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:54,610
Wow, wow, wow. It's very tight.

240
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,300
Oh, no, no, no.

241
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
I'm in trouble, too.

242
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,000
If you keep doing this, I'll be in trouble.

243
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Can I take it out?

244
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
No.

245
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
What?

246
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,920
Do you want to
take it out? Yes, I do.

247
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,360


248
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,260
Can I take it out?

249
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
Yes.

250
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,180
Look forward.

251
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,140
You can do like this.

252
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,700
I can do whatever I want.

253
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,740
You can do whatever you want.

254
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,340
I'm so excited to see your face.

255
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,740
Have you ever seen your erotic face?

256
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:46,695
You have a very erotic face.

257
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,990
Kana-san is crying.

258
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:24,991
I feel so bad.

259
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,050
Kana-san, I'm so sorry.

260
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,650
Are you all right?

261
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,890
Can I cry?

262
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,490
Can I cry for you?

263
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:42,491
Are you okay?

264
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,650
Hurry up! Oh, no.

265
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,670


266
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,790
I screamed so much.

267
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,100
Please try to do it.

268
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,000
It's so ticklish.

269
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
I'm tired.

270
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Do you feel better?

271
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Yes.

272
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,410
I saw your message on LINE.

273
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm in a hurry.

274
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,200
Are you coming?

275
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,440
Yes, about 5 minutes ago.

276
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,500
I heard you were drinking tea.

277
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
No, I'm not.

278
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,571
I sent you a message
saying it was the best.

279
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
What?

280
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,620
I sent you a message
saying it was the best.

281
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:32,621
No, I didn't.

282
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,151
I'm going to send this to
Sada-san, so I'll spread it out a little.

283
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,471
If Sada-san comes, will you stop it again?

284
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,210
No, I don't know.

285
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,780
I have to get in the way a little,
so I'll take a shower and go out.

286
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,620
Then let's do everything.

287
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:27,820
What are you doing?

288
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,260
I'm in such a state.

289
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm in such a mess.

290
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:38,235
I'm in a big trouble.

291
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,960
You're too excited.

292
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,380
I don't want to.

293
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,470
I was changing.

294
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,920
What? I was changing.

295
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180


296
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:49,395
Were you all right?

297
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,220
I wasn't all right.

298
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Why?

299
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,820
What are you doing?

300
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,900
What did you do?

301
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:07,901
What did you do?

302
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,680
Why are you asking me such a question?

303
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,781
I don't want you to ask me such a question.

304
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

305
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,340
Did you take a
video? Yes, I did.

306
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,801
I'll watch it later.

307
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,220
Don't look at me. I'm angry.

308
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,620
Was he mean?

309
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,980
I don't know if he was mean.

310
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Did you feel good?

311
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,860
Which one? It wasn't bad.

312
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,660


313
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
What? I'm jealous.

314
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,900


315
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,540
I want to be jealous.

316
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:52,140
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

317
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,440
Did you feel good?

318
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,700
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

319
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:05,560


320
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

321
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,700


322
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

323
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,140
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

324
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,420
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

325
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,160


326
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:29,840
I'm going to show you something erotic.

327
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,640
Oh, my God.

328
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,620
I'm going to show you something erotic.

329
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,520
I'm going to show you something erotic.

330
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:47,800
So, what's in the box?

331
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,760
I don't think it's all out.

332
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
There was a little bit.

333
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
What? Because.

334
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,160
..

335
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:57,620
What?

336
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,120
I didn't have time to clean it up.

337
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Really? That's right.

338
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520


339
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
You didn't like this?

340
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,080
No.

341
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,300
Were you a little
surprised? I was nervous.

342
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,460


343
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,160
Because I didn't know.

344
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:16,700
It's not bad, is it?

345
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,620
Your face and so on.

346
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,060
My face?

347
00:42:20,675 --> 00:42:21,720
I was a good person.

348
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,360
Right?

349
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes.

350
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:26,700
But, suddenly...

351
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,651
Next time, let's do something different.

352
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,850
Something different?

353
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Yes.

354
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm sorry.

355
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,850
No problem.

356
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,000
You're blushing.

357
00:42:48,001 --> 00:43:02,450
I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

358
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,466
I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

359
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,571
I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

360
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,926
I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

361
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,600
I'm scared.

362
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,730
Which one do you like?

363
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
Which one do you like?

364
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,420
This one?

365
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,400
Yes.

366
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,220
Do you like this one?

367
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
No.

368
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,240
What?

369
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
I like this one.

370
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,090
It's coming out a little.

371
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,530
I don't think so.

372
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,710
It's dry.

373
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,750
It's a mess.

374
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,730
Yes.

375
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,060
It's no good. Wait a minute.

376
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
It came out.

377
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Really? Tissue.

378
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,580
It's true.

379
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
Look at it.

380
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,110


381
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,620
Hey.

382
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Hey.

383
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Tissue came out.

384
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
It's true.

385
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,380
I didn't have time to bathe you.

386
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,300
I want to take a bath there.

387
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,171
Do you want to take a
bath now? No, I don't.

388
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,620


389
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,300
What did he do? It's normal.

390
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,300


391
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,080
What do you mean by normal?

392
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,821
I touched him a little
and put him in the bath.

393
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,570
But he did it with a toy.

394
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:26,990
Did he?

395
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,090
Yes.

396
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:36,590
I'm getting excited.

397
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,730
I'm starting to sweat.

398
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,850
I'm sure you're wet.

399
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,940
Do you want to increase
the number of people?

400
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
What?

401
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,020
Do you mean the number of people?

402
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Yes.

403
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,756
It's better to call two people.

404
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,740
No, it's better to call only two people.

405
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,630
Which one is better? This one.

406
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,960


407
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:51,950
Which one? This one.

408
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm jealous.

409
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,090
I'm jealous.

410
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,070


411
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,670
What is it?

412
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,440
Because you called me.

413
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,820
Me? I'm jealous.

414
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,640


415
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,220
Why?

416
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,800
Why did you call me?

417
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,600
Me?

418
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
Is this okay?

419
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,480
Did you want to be jealous?

420
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,760
Yes.

421
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,360
It's not good to be a very old man, is it?

422
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,700
If it's good, it's good.

423
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,761
It's not good to be a very
old man, is it? Wait a minute.

424
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,120
I'm a little nervous.

425
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,120
What kind of person
are you? I'm sorry.

426
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
I'm sorry.

427
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760


428
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,980
It's been a while since
I've been to the vet.

429
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:34,260
I will try to get the vet's approval.

430
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:34,340
But I will not be able to see the vet.

431
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:35,341
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

432
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,490


433
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:53,190
She is very excited.

434
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,380
I was saved by you.

435
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,320
What?

436
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,720
I was saved by you.

437
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,300
I can hear her voice.

438
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,930
Her spirit is also mixed.

439
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:15,130
I don't know which one is which.

440
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,950
Oh, it spilled.

441
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,110
Here is the tissue.

442
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,770
Oh, it spilled.

443
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,450
What did you do?

444
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,950
I did?

445
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
Did you play
with it? Yes, I did.

446
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,050


447
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,070
I was left alone on the phone.

448
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,610
Really? I don't know.

449
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:57,710


450
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,290
Does it hurt?

451
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:05,610
No.

452
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,510
Does it feel good?

453
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,350
Yes.

454
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,600
Do you feel
better? Just a little.

455
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,460


456
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,920
What? Just a little.

457
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,300


458
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,251
Because it's called sleeping.

459
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,460
I see.

460
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,860
Did you lick my
penis? No, I didn't.

461
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,340


462
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,931
You told me to take erotic pictures.

463
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,740
But that's not what I meant.

464
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:15,150
I thought you'd be happy
if I took those pictures.

465
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,830
I don't want to bother you any more.

466
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,710
Why?

467
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,950
I don't want to bother you.

468
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,290
Why? That's fine.

469
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,550


470
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,630
That's why I get excited.

471
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Don't get excited.

472
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,250
I don't want to.

473
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,341
You don't want to meet me
suddenly, do you? No, I don't.

474
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,160
Right? No, I don't.

475
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,200
Then do something
that makes me excited.

476
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,680
Then what do you want to do next?

477
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,860
Can I?

478
00:51:58,861 --> 00:51:59,260
Yes.

479
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
I might overdo it.

480
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,940
You can.

481
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:02,620
Really?

482
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,840
Yes.

483
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,450
I'm getting sleepy.

484
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,470
Yes.

485
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:10,730
I want to go to bed.

486
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:16,850
Show me.

487
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,540
You keep doing that.

488
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,171
Do you want to wipe your face again?

489
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,120
I have to wipe it.

490
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Wipe it.

491
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:35,000
If it's too wet, I don't want to put it in.

492
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,020
I want to see it.

493
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,370
Do you hate it? No, I don't.

494
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,590
Don't you drink it?

495
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:50,590
Which one? The blue one.

496
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,350
Don't you drink
it? The blue one.

497
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,810


498
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:54,230
When will you drink it?

499
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:54,270
Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready.

500
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,590


501
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,210
Are you comfortable?

502
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,661
Which side do you feel better?

503
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,950
I can't breathe.

504
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,573
This is the first time
I've ever seen a cat like

505
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:24,540
this, and I've never
seen a cat like this before.

506
00:54:27,895 --> 00:54:36,320
I've never seen a cat like this before,
and I've never seen a cat like this before.

507
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,320
I'm sorry.

508
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:47,321
I'm sorry.

509
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,700
I'm going to go again.

510
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,660
Are you OK?

511
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:54,040
I'm going to go again.

512
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,980
I'm worried about you.

513
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,200
I'm going to go again.

514
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,000
You are eating a lot.

515
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,180
Your skirt is dirty.

516
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,860
It's okay.

517
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,160
Are you okay?

518
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,380
I can do it later.

519
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,730
Does it mean that you have felt good?

520
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,010
No, it's not like that.

521
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,291
Isn't it embarrassing to
wear a skirt? No, it's not.

522
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,430


523
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,550
What should I do?

524
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,570
Is it OK? I'm hungry.

525
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,440


526
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:32,980
But you ate a lot.

527
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:50,620
I knew it.

528
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,440
What were you doing?

529
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,920
What were you doing just now?

530
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,740
Just now? Tell me.

531
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,640
Look at the camera.

532
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:27,680
I didn't do anything.

533
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,800
Look at the camera.
Tell me what you were doing just now.

534
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:39,580
Just now, I was having a
date with one of my juniors.

535
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:48,200
I told you I'd do it for you.

536
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,020
I told you I'd do it for you.

537
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,780
I did it because you told me to.

538
00:57:57,781 --> 00:57:59,880
Where did you
poop? In my stomach.

539
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,680


540
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,660
What?

541
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,040
I pooped in my stomach.

542
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
In your bag? Yes, in my bag.

543
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,780


544
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,540
Why didn't you tell me
you pooped in your bag?

545
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,140
I was cleaning my bottom.

546
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,620
You didn't poop in your stomach.

547
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,420
Did you want to be pooped?

548
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,760
No.

549
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,820
Which one? This one.

550
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,240


551
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,900
Are you sure?

552
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,320
Was it a little too early?

553
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
No.

554
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,280
What?

555
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,880
It's not like that.

556
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,480
Do you remember that? I'm sorry.

557
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,980


558
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,011
Do you want to hear
what I'm going to say next?

559
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,140
Yes.

560
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,410
Let's go.

561
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,071
You don't have to be angry.

562
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
I'll give you a massage.

563
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:02,660
I'll give you a massage.

564
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:34,240
I'm going to take a nap.

565
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:34,440
Are you crying? No, I'm not.

566
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,420


567
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,960
Do you want to take a nap anywhere?

568
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,120
Let's take a nap.

569
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,121
Here.

570
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,980
No?

571
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,150
No.

572
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,250
Closer.

573
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:50,370
Is he there?

574
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:51,250
No.

575
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,970
But I can hear his voice.

576
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,290
There is a mirror.

577
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,010
I can hear his voice.

578
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,586
Do you want to look
in the mirror? Yes, I do.

579
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,610


580
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:06,010
I want to look at his back.

581
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,350
I want to see you doing it.

582
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:09,830
Yes.

583
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:29,490
Does it feel good?

584
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:30,491
Yes.

585
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:38,370
I'll send you my cell phone later.

586
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,630
Don't look at it at home.

587
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,130
OK.

588
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,340
You can look at it next
to your husband's bed.

589
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,080
Do you feel good?

590
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,000
Yes.

591
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,760
Do you feel good?

592
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:34,820
Do you feel good?

593
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,460
Yes.

594
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,460
Please let me sleep.

595
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:02,461
You shouldn't kiss me.

596
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:12,260
You want to be kissed a lot.

597
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,410
Let's get started.

598
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:43,770
Look, it's called ferrous.

599
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:49,190
Yes, ferrous.

600
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:54,950
It's hot.

601
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,420
It's hot.

602
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:18,630
It's hot.

603
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,680
What did you do in front of him?

604
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,350
You didn't do anything?

605
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,760
I didn't tell him.

606
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:43,761
That's good.

607
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:45,940
I want to see it.

608
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
What is it? I don't know.

609
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000


610
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,760
Here?

611
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,880
Yes.

612
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,460
How do you do it?

613
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:00,780
By hand?

614
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,740
With a toy?

615
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,436
Do you want me to bring it to you?

616
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,460
Let's do it by hand.

617
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:05,320
Yes.

618
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,040
Are you filming?

619
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,070
I'm so excited to be filmed.

620
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,450
Are you okay?

621
01:05:18,975 --> 01:05:20,296
I'm starting to like it a little.

622
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,150
Let's take a lot more.

623
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:25,330
Did you use this earlier?

624
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,590
Yes.

625
01:05:48,000 --> 01:06:10,890
This is the first time I've ever seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little worried.

626
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,800
I'm worried about the cat's health.

627
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,811
I'm worried about the cat's health.

628
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:28,700
I'm worried about the cat's health.

629
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:31,960
It's heavy.

630
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:26,870
What are you doing?

631
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:28,950
I'm massaging your belly.

632
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:30,350
I'm massaging your belly.

633
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:33,110
I'm going to put you in a
place where you can go.

634
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,170
You can't go yet.

635
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:41,250
I can't?

636
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,270
You should keep it.

637
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,530
I'm glad.

638
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,870
You can go as soon as I say yes.

639
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,650
I'm glad.

640
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:18,620
You should keep it.

641
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,400
I can't do it.

642
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,480
It's OK.

643
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,560
You can do it.

644
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,920
OK.

645
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,580
I can do it.

646
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:34,860
I can't do it.

647
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,130
I am going to take a bath.

648
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,160
It's so hot.

649
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:54,880
What? It feels good.

650
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,430


651
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,000
I am going to take a bath.

652
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,860
It hurts.

653
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,040
I'm going to wipe the tissue.

654
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:18,041
What is this
tissue? It's a towel.

655
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,460


656
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,180
What? It's a towel.

657
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:20,980


658
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:21,580
Is it his? No, it's not.

659
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,780


660
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:23,620
I'm going to make breakfast
again when I get home.

661
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,550
How do you feel?

662
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:50,020
Do you feel good? I feel good.

663
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,720


664
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,830
You are full of sense.

665
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:28,390
You are full of sense.

666
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,570
Yes, I am.

667
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,550
I was breathing.

668
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:35,551
I was sleeping.

669
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:39,870
Honey.

670
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,280
Are you going to sleep?

671
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,160
I'm going to sleep.

672
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,620
OK.

673
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,670
What's wrong? Show me.

674
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:07,730
I can't get up.

675
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800


676
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:29,640
I'll give you a massage.

677
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,070
Aiko, do you feel good?

678
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:48,630
Yes, I feel good.

679
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:50,590
You are a pervert.

680
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:52,950
You are a pervert.

681
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:53,951
You are a pervert.

682
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,310
Who is making such
a noise? I don't know.

683
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:00,630


684
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,641
There was a different Jinko earlier.

685
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,520
I don't feel so good.

686
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:10,521
It's not working.

687
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,920
It's working. I told you.

688
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:14,040
I cheated a little.

689
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,200
I'll check it later.

690
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,080
I'm sorry.

691
01:14:19,215 --> 01:14:20,720
I'm sorry.

692
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:23,150
Which one do you like?

693
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,100
I like this one.

694
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,640
Is it obvious?

695
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,680
Yes.

696
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:31,630
You know that,
don't you? I know.

697
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,140


698
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:44,170
I wonder if I should
bother him more this time.

699
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:44,430
What?

700
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:46,311
I wonder if I should
bother him more this time.

701
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,230
What are you going to do this time?

702
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:51,950
What?

703
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,000
I want to bother him more.

704
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
Why? Are you tired?

705
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,460
Because you had sex with him.

706
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:00,740
I feel good.

707
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,020
I'm enjoying it.

708
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,040
Are you enjoying it?

709
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,460
Yes.

710
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,270
Is that okay?

711
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:14,990
What?

712
01:15:14,991 --> 01:15:15,490
Is that okay?

713
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,630
Yes.

714
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:49,140
Do you feel it? Do you want me
to take your eyes off? It feels good.

715
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,800


716
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,730
My nose is itchy.

717
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:26,880
Are you done?

718
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,380
Yes.

719
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,420
Are you done? I'm sorry.

720
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,480
I'm sorry.

721
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:52,630
What? I'm sorry.

722
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,090


723
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:59,790
You have gone somewhere.

724
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,410
I'm sorry.

725
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,290
I'm so sorry.

726
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:05,830
I'm sorry.

727
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,590
You have gone somewhere.

728
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,890
I'm conscious.

729
01:18:11,891 --> 01:18:13,011
Where is your
consciousness? It's gone.

730
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,690
Give me more.

731
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:53,960


732
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:57,066
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's been

733
01:19:57,078 --> 01:20:07,690
a long time since I've seen a
cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

734
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:30,944
I'm not sure if it's because it's
been a long time since I've seen a cat

735
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:37,420
like this, but it's been a long
time since I've seen a cat like this.

736
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:41,170
It may come out again.

737
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,510
Is that so?

738
01:20:44,395 --> 01:20:46,970
I haven't taken it out
yet, so I can't do it yet.

739
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,030
I'm sad.

740
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,070
You are sleeping.

741
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,240
I'm not.

742
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,220
You are sleeping.

743
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:20,290
You like it suddenly, don't you?

744
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:24,490
I have a lot of surprises today.

745
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,530
What is it? Open your legs.

746
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:27,070
Hurry up.

747
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,390


748
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:32,010
What is it? Open your legs.

749
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,050


750
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,650
I can't open my legs.

751
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:36,210
What?

752
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:41,610
I can't open my legs today.

753
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:44,290
You can't?

754
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,291
No.

755
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,440
Ah, I'm sleepy.

756
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:25,700
Ah, I'm sleepy.

757
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,130
Ah, I'm sleepy.

758
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:35,331
When are you going to wake up?

759
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,030
I'm going to sleep.

760
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,910
I'm going to sleep.

761
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,270
Are you going to
hug me? Of course.

762
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:43,550


763
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,260
What?

764
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:20,670
Are you doing it right?

765
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:22,450
Yes.

766
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,610
Don't you want to take it off?

767
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:26,150
No.

768
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,730
You have sprained your ankle.

769
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:39,390
Yes.

770
01:23:40,435 --> 01:23:42,075
Is it easier to walk with sprained ankle?

771
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,830
I'm going to give you a shot.

772
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,610
I'm going to give you a shot.

773
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:55,500
I'm going to give you a shot.

774

781
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,070
Yui-chan, let me see your face.

782
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:38,211
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

783
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,250
Do you want to go again?

784
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,190
I want to go again.

785
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:48,990
I'm sorry.

786
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:53,650
Ouch! I can't do it.

787
01:26:53,651 --> 01:26:54,651
I can't do it.

788
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:57,210
I can't do it.

789
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,410
Wait a minute.

790
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:58,411
I can't do it.

791
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,070
I can't do it.

792
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:04,230


793
01:27:26,715 --> 01:27:31,060
Let's do a test!

794
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:31,200
A moment of bliss!

795
01:27:31,201 --> 01:27:32,201
Why do I want to sleep?

796
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:44,030
Every time I meet you, I
gradually become a pervert.

797
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:48,520
No no no.

798
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,200
It's a good thing.

799
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,080
I took the tissue.

800
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:13,210
I thought it was his sperm.

801
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,630
There's no way it's left.

802
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:18,850
If you let it out like this.

803
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,570
There's a resistance.

804
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:23,430
Do you want me to do it?

805
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:26,550
I want you to do it.

806
01:28:37,720 --> 01:29:17,120
Good morning, baby.

807
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:19,540
I can't get out.

808
01:29:21,765 --> 01:29:22,876
You can't get out until
your body is not moving.

809
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,400
I want to get out...
Get out? Give me more.

810
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,401


811
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,060
Do you want more?

812
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:27,940
Yes.

813
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,320
Will it come out?

814
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,800
Yes.

815
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,820
But...

816
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,140
Really?

817
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,360
Even if it gets hard, it
won't come out, right?

818
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,720
It will come out.

819
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,731
Even if it's just a
little, it will come out.

820
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,100
Yes.

821
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,360
Yes.

822
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:15,310
I want to see your butt.

823
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:16,850
I can see it.

824
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:39,610
I want to put it in a little more.

825
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,401
If you don't put it in a little
more, it won't come out.

826
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,460
What?

827
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:50,860
Do you want to put it out again?

828
01:31:50,861 --> 01:31:52,141
Do you want me to tie
your hair? Yes, please.

829
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:52,980
Where? Inside.

830
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:54,310


831
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:55,660


832
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:01,860
I want you to tie my hair more.

833
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,211
I have to tie your hair inside.

834
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,640
Please tie my hair more inside.

835
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,380
Look at me.

836
01:32:19,381 --> 01:32:20,381
What are you doing?

837
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:25,760
I want you to put a
lot of it in my stomach.

838
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,050
Oh, no.

839
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,080
What are you
saying? I don't know.

840
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,780


841
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:41,020
It doesn't matter who you are.

842
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:43,940
I don't know.

843
01:32:43,941 --> 01:32:44,360
It doesn't matter who you are.

844
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,020
I don't know.

845
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,640
It's up to you.

846
01:32:47,641 --> 01:32:48,820
I'm not a doctor.

847
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,440
You're not a doctor.

848
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:51,940
I'm not.

849
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,080
I'm not a doctor.

850
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:11,140
Let me see.

851
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,390
That's definitely her.

852
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,930
No, it's not.

853
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:27,530
I'm not touching you.

854
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,770
I'm touching him.

855
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:32,010
I wiped him with a tissue.

856
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,800
Is this the best?

857
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,400
Yes.

858
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,580
Is this the best?

859
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,600
Yes.

860
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:18,870
It feels good.

861
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:20,130
Can't you do it
anymore? I can do it.

862
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:21,750


863
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:23,030
Can you do it?

864
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,251
How many times do I have to do it?

865
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,970
I have to wipe it properly.

866
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,810
Wait a minute.

867
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:35,950
Wait a minute.

868
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:37,590
Is it coming out now? It's gone.

869
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:38,750


870
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:43,830
What are you going
to do? Help me.

871
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:45,750


872
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,070
It's always coming out.

873
01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:51,936
You'll be found out when you get home.

874
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,730
It's likely to be found out.

875
01:34:56,731 --> 01:34:57,731
As expected.

876
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:06,740
Huh?

877
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:07,360
Yes.

878
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,580
Look at me.

879
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:41,750
Really?

880
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:43,130
Yes.

881
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,050
Yes.

882
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:08,870
Wow.

883
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:10,070
Really.

884
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,280
You have more people.

885
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,780
Right? I'm fine.

886
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,020
I'm fine.

887
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:30,580
You're fine.

888
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:31,740


889
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,120
Yes.

890
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:43,600
When I was there, you were in front of
me, and there were two people around you.

891
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:49,740
I was just looking at you.

892
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,620
You were looking at
me, and you were peeing.

893
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:59,070
I can't do it.

894
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:01,990
If you want, I can do it.

895
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:03,490
How is it?

896
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:04,550
What is it? I just said it.

897
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,530
I said it.

898
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:17,130


899
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:56,820
Anyway, it's still daytime.

900
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:10,570
When I was called to the hotel, I
thought something was going to happen.

901
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:13,790
What is it?

902
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,130
What?

903
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,910
Can you sleep?

904
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,590
Yes.

905
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,920
I love you.

906
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:23,340
I love you.

907
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,740
I love you.

908
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:53,140
Let's take a closer look at your tomorrow.

909
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,780
Your stomach is grumbling.

910
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:17,811
...there's a lot of stomach grumbling.

911
01:40:18,145 --> 01:40:19,320
a lot of stomach grumbling.

912
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,161
...I have no idea how
many times this happened.

913
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,180
It's not enough, has it?

914
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,880
I'm going to get tired.

915
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:32,500
I'm going to get tired.

916
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:33,620
I'm going to get tired.

917
01:40:33,645 --> 01:40:48,470
It feels good.

918
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:17,840
What are you doing?

919
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:19,840
What is this?

920
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,060
I'm going to give you a vibration.

921
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:34,550
I feel good.

922
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:39,950
I feel good.

923
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:41,730
No, I can't.

924
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:56,630
No, I can't.

925
01:41:57,470 --> 01:42:04,570
It feels so good.

926
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,460
It feels good.

927
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,380
What do you feel
like? I feel so sick.

928
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:37,960


929
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:41,880
What kind of face you have.

930
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:48,920
This face... I don't know...

931
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,430
What? What are you holding
in your hand? It's so hot.

932
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,700
My stomach is growling.

933
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:08,520
Oh, wow.

934
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:10,760
Thank you.

935
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,200
I like this.

936
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:31,950
Do you want to do more?

937
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:53,800
Do you want to do more?

938
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:55,770
Yes.

939
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:12,300
It's amazing.

940
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:52,640
Is it heavy?

941
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:54,110
Yes.

942
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:40,260
I'm so happy.

943
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,720
My heart is beating so fast.

944
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,680
Really?

945
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,240
Yes.

946
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,660
I'm so tired.

947
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:56,720
Let's do it here.

948
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:57,840
What?

949
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:02,000
There is no tissue.

950
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:03,980
That's right.

951
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:04,260
What?

952
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,820
There is no tissue.

953
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:21,920
Chocolate.

954
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:50,950
The same.

955
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:53,270
The same.

956
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:25,830
Are you OK? It feels good.

957
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:38,190
It's fine.

958
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:06,130
I'm sorry.

959
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:14,740
It's okay.

960
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:15,741
It's okay.

961
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,310
It's cold.

962
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:42,800


963
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:43,920
You've got a bump.

964
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,500
It doesn't hurt much.

965
01:51:48,580 --> 01:52:07,040
I'm happy about that.

966
01:52:07,041 --> 01:52:08,041
It's okay.

967
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:20,430
This tissue is dangerous.

968
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:22,170
I have to clean it up.

969
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:29,560
I want to do something perverted.

970
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:36,830
I want to do more.

971
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:41,491
I can do it as much as I want.

972
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:01,751
But it's better on weekdays, isn't it?

973
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:03,190
Yes.

974
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,840
If you're going to meet him.

975
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:07,711
There's someone I think I can meet.

976
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:13,400
Did you cover your eyes this time?

977
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:14,910
Yes.

978
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:16,800
I'm covering my eyes.

979
01:53:19,255 --> 01:53:21,476
If you're covering your eyes, I don't
know who you're having sex with.

980
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,760
No, I'm not.

981
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:36,670
I don't have a tissue.

982
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:38,590
I don't have a tissue.

983
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:40,210
You don't have a
tissue? No, I don't.

984
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:41,410
Tissue paper.

985
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:45,250


986
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,700
We still have this.

987
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,870
We still have this.

988
01:53:49,871 --> 01:53:50,871
Oh, really?

989
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:57,240
I have to get a tissue.

990
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,221
You might be asked,
Do you lose that much?

991
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,420
Don't you think so?

992
01:54:06,045 --> 01:54:08,780
I'm worried if you say that.

993
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:22,100
Do you want to take a nap?

994
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,040
Yes.

995
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:25,870
Let's do it again later.

996
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:26,340
Yes.

997
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,200
Really?

998
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,400
If you take a rest.

999
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:29,860
No.

1000
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,660
Are you still standing?

1001
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,320
Yes.
