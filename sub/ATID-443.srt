1
32.37 --> 35.37
 You can do it, you still have a long way to go.

2
37.37 --> 38.37
 I'm back.

3
38.37 --> 40.37
 Welcome back.

4
42.37 --> 44.37
 I was talking to Emi about her job.

5
44.37 --> 46.37
 I met Yuto.

6
46.37 --> 49.37
 We were drinking and talking.

7
49.37 --> 51.37
 Introduce me to Emi.

8
51.37 --> 53.37
 Welcome back, brother.

9
53.37 --> 56.37
 He is Tashiro, Sakurano's senior.

10
57.37 --> 58.37
 Nice to meet you.

11
58.37 --> 64.37
 I'm Yuto Tashiro, majoring in film culture.

12
65.37 --> 66.37
 I'm sorry.

13
66.37 --> 72.19
 I'm going out with Emi.

14
72.19 --> 74.19
 You are so beautiful.

15
76.19 --> 78.19
 You don't look like you.

16
78.19 --> 81.19
 Yuto, you are so good.

17
83.19 --> 85.19
 Emi is younger than you.

18
86.19 --> 87.19
 She is young.

19
90.19 --> 95.19
 Since we are here, can you tell us about your relationship?

20
95.19 --> 96.19
 It's embarrassing.

21
96.19 --> 98.19
 Please tell us.

22
99.19 --> 103.19
 He was a junior in the club.

23
103.19 --> 105.19
 He just graduated.

24
105.19 --> 107.19
 He was unreliable.

25
107.19 --> 113.19
 While I was following him, he asked me to marry him.

26
114.19 --> 117.19
 Your charm made him do that.

27
118.19 --> 122.19
 I wanted to be successful.

28
122.19 --> 125.19
 I thought Dinkus would be good.

29
125.19 --> 128.19
 I lost to his charm.

30
129.19 --> 133.19
 But now I'm a project leader.

31
133.19 --> 135.19
 I'm a different person now.

32
135.19 --> 136.19
 I see.

33
136.19 --> 138.19
 Congratulations.

34
139.19 --> 141.19
 Let's drink.

35
141.19 --> 143.19
 Emi, is the champagne cold?

36
143.19 --> 144.19
 I'll get it.

37
144.19 --> 150.14
 Emi, Yuto is so handsome.

38
150.14 --> 153.14
 He is good at talking.

39
155.14 --> 158.14
 Tatsuya is not good at talking.

40
158.14 --> 160.14
 He is like a country boy.

41
161.14 --> 164.14
 It's good to be a college student.

42
164.14 --> 166.14
 It's cold.

43
166.14 --> 167.14
 Is it cold?

44
167.14 --> 169.14
 That's good.

45
169.14 --> 170.14
 I bought a good one.

46
170.14 --> 172.14
 Let's open it.

47
172.14 --> 174.14
 I'll leave my bag here.

48
174.14 --> 177.58
 I'll open it first.

49
177.58 --> 179.58
 Let's open it.

50
183.62 --> 185.62
 You bought it for me.

51
185.62 --> 186.62
 Yes.

52
186.62 --> 188.62
 Did you choose it by yourself?

53
188.62 --> 189.62
 Yes.

54
189.62 --> 191.62
 I'm glad.

55
207.82 --> 209.82
 She has been married for 3 years.

56
209.82 --> 211.82
 She has a wife who is 3 years older than her.

57
211.82 --> 213.82
 She used to be a boss.

58
213.82 --> 216.82
 She has a new project.

59
216.82 --> 218.82
 She has a lot of work.

60
219.82 --> 222.82
 She is good-looking.

61
222.82 --> 225.82
 But, I want a child.

62
235.88 --> 238.88
 Emi, did you forget this?

63
239.88 --> 241.88
 I don't know.

64
242.88 --> 244.88
 I think you can run.

65
244.88 --> 245.88
 I'll bring it to you.

66
245.88 --> 246.88
 Okay.

67
246.88 --> 247.88
 Be careful.

68
247.88 --> 249.88
 I'll be back soon.

69
249.88 --> 250.88
 Okay.

70
250.88 --> 266.75
 Your sister is so beautiful.

71
266.75 --> 269.75
 She will react to me.

72
269.75 --> 273.75
 She has a lot of money.

73
273.75 --> 277.75
 I want an adult woman to look at me.

74
277.75 --> 279.75
 I have an idea.

75
279.75 --> 282.75
 I want to be a mom.

76
283.75 --> 284.75
 I have an idea.

77
284.75 --> 285.75
 Emi.

78
285.75 --> 290.75
 Ask your sister if she can introduce me to a sponsor.

79
297.54 --> 299.54
 What are you talking about?

80
299.54 --> 302.54
 Don't look at her like that.

81
304.54 --> 309.54
 It's not good for a man to ask a woman for money.

82
309.54 --> 311.54
 Shut up.

83
311.54 --> 313.54
 This is what Emi told me.

84
313.54 --> 314.54
 What?

85
314.54 --> 318.05
 She is a jealous woman.

86
318.05 --> 320.05
 Do you have that?

87
321.05 --> 322.05
 She is good-looking.

88
322.05 --> 323.05
 Give it back.

89
323.05 --> 324.05
 Stop it.

90
324.05 --> 325.05
 Give it back.

91
325.05 --> 332.74
 She is good-looking.

92
332.74 --> 334.74
 Can you ask her?

93
334.74 --> 335.74
 What?

94
335.74 --> 337.34
 Wait a minute.

95
337.34 --> 339.98
 Emi, what's wrong?

96
339.98 --> 341.68
 Hey, brother.

97
341.68 --> 343.18
 You're not in a good mood.

98
343.18 --> 344.94
 No, I'm not.

99
344.94 --> 348.34
 Emi got drunk and I was helping her out.

100
348.34 --> 351.78
 Oh, I forgot this.

101
351.78 --> 353.44
 Thank you.

102
353.44 --> 354.94
 Thank you.

103
354.94 --> 358.38
 I'll go take care of Emi.

104
358.38 --> 360.04
 Thank you for the food.

105
360.04 --> 360.88
 Take care.

106
360.88 --> 362.24
 I'll go.

107
363.28 --> 364.50
 Are you okay?

108
365.34 --> 376.53
 I'm fine.

109
376.53 --> 378.73
 I'll be back soon.

110
378.73 --> 406.96
 Hey, Mirei.

111
406.96 --> 409.96
 How are you doing today?

112
409.96 --> 412.26
 You don't look like it.

113
412.26 --> 416.46
 Well, I'm tired.

114
416.46 --> 421.76
 I've been busy since the project leader kicked me out.

115
421.76 --> 424.36
 It's okay if I wear a rubber band,

116
424.36 --> 429.61
 but I don't want to have a baby yet.

117
429.71 --> 433.21
 I want to have a baby.

118
433.21 --> 436.01
 Mirei is already 33 years old.

119
436.01 --> 439.11
 I think it's a good time.

120
439.11 --> 440.91
 What?

121
440.91 --> 443.11
 Do you mean I'm a virgin?

122
443.11 --> 446.11
 Do you mean it's hard to give birth?

123
446.11 --> 449.61
 You should be careful between a husband and a wife.

124
449.61 --> 454.11
 You shouldn't say anything that denies feminism.

125
454.11 --> 456.51
 It's always like this lately.

126
456.51 --> 460.51
 When I invite Mirei, she refuses.

127
460.51 --> 464.51
 At work, she's in a better position than me.

128
464.51 --> 466.71
 After being kicked out of the project,

129
466.71 --> 470.71
 she's busy with her business trips.

130
470.71 --> 473.51
 I can understand that,

131
473.51 --> 478.01
 but I have doubts about being a couple with Mirei.

132
478.01 --> 481.21
 My wife probably...

133
481.21 --> 570.97
 No, I expect her to doubt it.

134
570.97 --> 576.58
 Hey, you're back.

135
576.58 --> 578.78
 Where's Mirei?

136
578.78 --> 583.78
 She went shopping.

137
583.78 --> 590.58
 I fell asleep because I stayed up all night at the airport last night.

138
590.58 --> 592.58
 Can I borrow your shower?

139
592.58 --> 613.62
 Of course.

140
682.38 --> 684.28
 My wife's sister.

141
684.28 --> 687.78
 I was fascinated by her.

142
687.88 --> 691.58
 She was young and beautiful.

143
691.58 --> 735.14
 By the way, I haven't been a wife for a long time.

144
735.14 --> 737.54
 Emi-chan.

145
737.54 --> 789.92
 I'll leave the towel here.

146
789.92 --> 793.12
 Emi-chan, what's wrong?

147
793.12 --> 799.37
 I have something to talk to you.

148
799.37 --> 801.67
 You're wearing a guerrilla uniform.

149
801.67 --> 805.56
 I haven't seen you for a while.

150
805.56 --> 808.06
 You're wet. Go home.

151
838.31 --> 842.01
 Emi-chan, use this.

152
842.01 --> 845.52
 Thank you.

153
845.52 --> 877.16
 I'll give you a hot drink.

154
877.16 --> 879.96
 It might be hot. Be careful.

155
879.96 --> 890.87
 Thank you.

156
890.87 --> 897.77
 I heard something about Mirei.

157
897.77 --> 903.52
 Is it about Yuto?

158
903.52 --> 912.27
 Can a man be with another woman even if he has a girlfriend?

159
912.37 --> 919.91
 Is it okay to hurt a girl you like?

160
919.91 --> 926.87
 Why do you do something bad to a girl you like?

161
926.87 --> 932.57
 I think it's because she's selfish.

162
932.57 --> 938.38
 She can only think about herself.

163
938.38 --> 943.68
 Adults don't do bad things to their loved ones.

164
943.68 --> 947.68
 Some people are mean to their loved ones.

165
947.68 --> 951.98
 They're just kids.

166
951.98 --> 957.88
 Adults don't do bad things.

167
957.88 --> 960.18
 Emi-chan.

168
960.18 --> 964.88
 If you don't like it, you should say it.

169
964.88 --> 993.44
 Because you're an adult.

170
993.44 --> 997.44
 You're kind.

171
1000.07 --> 1005.46
 Emi-chan.

172
1006.76 --> 1064.18
 What happened?

173
1068.18 --> 1087.56
 I'm sorry.

174
1117.56 --> 1178.16
 What's wrong?

175
1178.16 --> 1224.42
 Emi-chan.

176
1227.42 --> 1229.92
 I'm sorry.

177
1229.92 --> 1258.52
 What happened?

178
1258.52 --> 1260.52
 Ebi-chan

179
1265.52 --> 1267.52
 Ebi-chan

180
1269.52 --> 1271.52
 Ebi-chan

181
1274.52 --> 1285.13
 Ebi-chan

182
1286.13 --> 1287.13
 Takuya

183
1287.13 --> 1288.13
 Tatsuya

184
1288.13 --> 1290.13
 Are you coming back?

185
1290.13 --> 1292.13
 I'm sorry

186
1292.13 --> 1293.13
 Come back

187
1293.13 --> 1299.92
 Ebi-chan

188
1299.92 --> 1322.05
 Ebi, what's wrong?

189
1322.05 --> 1324.05
 Ebi-chan, I'm back

190
1324.05 --> 1326.05
 Oh, I see

191
1326.05 --> 1328.05
 Oh, it's the worst

192
1328.05 --> 1336.29
 I'm sorry

193
1336.29 --> 1338.29
 Oh, I see

194
1338.29 --> 1342.05
 Ebi hasn't eaten yet

195
1342.05 --> 1346.07
 Let's take a delivery and drink

196
1346.07 --> 1348.07
 Oh, that's right

197
1348.07 --> 1350.07
 Ebi is also in a bad mood, right?

198
1350.07 --> 1352.07
 Oh, it's the worst

199
1352.07 --> 1354.07
 I'm sorry

200
1367.68 --> 1383.28
 I'm contacting you

201
1383.28 --> 1385.28
 You're blocking me

202
1386.28 --> 1388.28
 Hey, don't talk to me

203
1389.28 --> 1391.28
 I told you not to see me anymore

204
1391.28 --> 1395.28
 I'm not your lover anymore

205
1398.79 --> 1400.79
 Is it okay?

206
1400.79 --> 1401.79
 What?

207
1401.79 --> 1407.37
 This photo

208
1407.37 --> 1414.84
 Hey

209
1414.84 --> 1416.84
 I'm in trouble

210
1416.84 --> 1418.84
 Can you help me?

211
1418.84 --> 1421.84
 If you don't give me that photo, I'll call the police

212
1422.84 --> 1424.84
 You're so rude

213
1424.84 --> 1426.84
 Wait

214
1426.84 --> 1428.84
 Hey

215
1428.84 --> 1430.84
 Remember, I told you I'd introduce you to Ebi

216
1430.84 --> 1432.84
 I told you not to

217
1432.84 --> 1435.84
 Ebi, what are you doing?

218
1435.84 --> 1437.84
 Don't follow me

219
1437.84 --> 1439.84
 You're so noisy

220
1446.84 --> 1449.84
 Hey, stop it

221
1451.84 --> 1453.84
 I'm in trouble

222
1454.84 --> 1458.28
 Are you okay?

223
1458.28 --> 1461.92
 Are you hurt?

224
1461.92 --> 1462.92
 I'm fine, thank you

225
1462.92 --> 1504.47
 It'll be over soon

226
1504.47 --> 1506.47
 Are you okay?

227
1506.47 --> 1508.47
 I'm fine

228
1508.47 --> 1510.47
 Ouch

229
1510.47 --> 1514.10
 I

230
1514.10 --> 1516.10
 Yuto

231
1516.10 --> 1518.10
 He took a picture of me

232
1518.10 --> 1521.10
 Yuto took it without my permission

233
1521.10 --> 1525.95
 He spread it

234
1525.95 --> 1527.95
 Oh, I see

235
1527.95 --> 1529.95
 That's why you're in trouble

236
1529.95 --> 1538.04
 I'll take care of it

237
1539.04 --> 1541.04
 I have a lawyer friend

238
1541.04 --> 1543.04
 I'll talk to him

239
1543.04 --> 1547.04
 You should deal with Revenge Porno legally

240
1547.04 --> 1549.04
 Leave Emi alone

241
1549.04 --> 1551.04
 Leave it to us

242
1551.04 --> 1563.87
 You shouldn't see Yuto anymore

243
1563.87 --> 1572.88
 I wish you weren't my husband

244
1775.45 --> 1777.45
 I'm sorry

245
1777.45 --> 1779.45
 It'll be over soon

246
1779.45 --> 1786.17
 Emi, It's okay

247
1786.17 --> 1788.17
 I'm so sorry

248
1788.17 --> 1803.77
 I'm sorry

249
1806.77 --> 1824.94
 Don't be like this

250
1825.94 --> 1872.58
 I'm sorry

251
1873.58 --> 1875.58
 I'm sorry

252
1875.58 --> 1899.73
 ⚡Manzai girl's cry⚡

253
1906.69 --> 1921.24
 In the middle...

254
1921.24 --> 1924.06
 Because it's Umi...

255
1924.06 --> 1950.93
 Umi...

256
1950.93 --> 1954.29
 You musn't do this...

257
1954.29 --> 1957.91
 You mustn't touch me...

258
1957.91 --> 2000.23
 It's not that place.

259
2000.23 --> 2002.23
 You're so wet.

260
2002.23 --> 2012.26
 My underwear is coming off.

261
2012.26 --> 2076.05
 It's strange.

262
2076.05 --> 2081.05
 Let me see your eyes.

263
2088.96 --> 2099.67
 Your underwear is coming off.

264
2099.67 --> 2113.92
 No, no.

265
2152.45 --> 2153.95
 Nii-chan.

266
2153.95 --> 2177.51
 Nii-chan.

267
2178.01 --> 2206.23
 It's so gross.

268
2310.26 --> 2312.26
 Nii-chan's fingers are in there.

269
2313.26 --> 2317.64
 It's so hot inside here.

270
2318.64 --> 2321.64
 Nii-chan's fingers are in there.

271
2331.24 --> 2333.24
 It's so gross, Nii-chan.

272
2372.92 --> 2374.92
 Nii-chan.

273
2377.92 --> 2379.92
 It's so gross.

274
2380.92 --> 2388.48
 It's so hot.

275
2389.48 --> 2392.48
 Nii-chan, don't do that.

276
2492.42 --> 2504.31
 Nii-chan.

277
2504.31 --> 2506.31
 It feels so good.

278
2507.31 --> 2509.31
 It feels so good.

279
2509.31 --> 2511.31
 It feels so good, Nii-chan.

280
2522.96 --> 2524.96
 It feels so good.

281
2524.96 --> 2526.96
 It feels so good, Nii-chan.

282
2543.96 --> 2545.96
 It feels so good.

283
2548.96 --> 2551.96
 I don't know why I'm so excited.

284
2594.54 --> 2596.54
 It feels so good.

285
2596.54 --> 2598.54
 It feels so good, Nii-chan.

286
2598.54 --> 2602.62
 It feels so good.

287
2608.56 --> 2623.64
 It feels so good.

288
2660.36 --> 2749.69
 That's all I have.

289
2749.69 --> 2751.69
 Nii-chan.

290
2753.69 --> 2755.69
 Nii-chan.

291
2757.69 --> 2784.49
 I don't know what to do.

292
2784.49 --> 2786.49
 I don't know what to do.

293
2794.57 --> 2796.57
 She's so cute.

294
2826.84 --> 2837.90
 It feels so good.

295
2837.90 --> 2839.90
 It feels so good.

296
2839.90 --> 2844.62
 It feels so good.

297
2844.62 --> 2849.66
 It feels so good.

298
2895.50 --> 2897.50
 It feels so good.

299
3003.24 --> 3005.24
 It feels so good.

300
3005.24 --> 3011.17
 It feels so good.

301
3011.17 --> 3200.56
 It feels so good.

302
3200.56 --> 3202.56
 It feels so good.

303
3203.56 --> 3205.56
 It feels so good.

304
3436.32 --> 3438.32
 It feels so good.

305
3507.36 --> 3509.36
 It feels so good.

306
3509.36 --> 3534.04
 It feels so good.

307
3645.77 --> 3725.05
 It must be hard to get a job.

308
3726.05 --> 3729.05
 Did you hear about the entrance exam?

309
3729.05 --> 3731.05
 I wonder if I should ask.

310
3731.05 --> 3733.05
 I don't know at all.

311
3733.05 --> 3734.05
 I'm home.

312
3734.05 --> 3736.05
 Welcome home.

313
3736.05 --> 3738.05
 Emi is here.

314
3738.05 --> 3740.05
 I'm here to see you.

315
3745.76 --> 3746.76
 I'm sorry.

316
3746.76 --> 3748.76
 I asked for a delivery again tonight.

317
3748.76 --> 3750.76
 Why don't you eat something?

318
3750.76 --> 3752.76
 I'll eat.

319
3752.76 --> 3754.76
 Do you want some alcohol?

320
3754.76 --> 3755.76
 Do you?

321
3755.76 --> 3756.76
 I'll have some.

322
3756.76 --> 3757.76
 Okay.

323
3758.76 --> 3760.76
 Don't hesitate to eat.

324
3761.76 --> 3764.97
 It's quite good.

325
3764.97 --> 3765.97
 I know.

326
3765.97 --> 3767.97
 This looks good, doesn't it?

327
3767.97 --> 3768.97
 It's a delivery.

328
3768.97 --> 3779.58
 I have a refill.

329
3781.58 --> 3783.58
 Where did you buy this?

330
3783.58 --> 3785.58
 It looks great.

331
3785.58 --> 3787.58
 I found this at a department store.

332
3787.58 --> 3788.58
 Here?

333
3788.58 --> 3789.58
 Yes.

334
3790.58 --> 3792.58
 I was confused.

335
3792.58 --> 3796.58
 They were so confused the other day.

336
3796.58 --> 3800.58
 Emi acted as if nothing had happened.

337
3801.58 --> 3804.58
 I was fascinated by her.

338
3805.58 --> 3811.81
 I fell in love with her.

339
3817.00 --> 3820.00
 You're going home late, aren't you?

340
3820.00 --> 3822.00
 You know I'm busy with work, don't you?

341
3822.00 --> 3824.00
 You have a lot of work.

342
3824.00 --> 3826.00
 I have no choice.

343
3826.00 --> 3828.00
 I have a lot of time.

344
3828.00 --> 3832.15
 Are you doing your best for the new year?

345
3832.15 --> 3834.15
 Me?

346
3834.15 --> 3839.78
 I'm trying, but it's hard.

347
3839.78 --> 3840.78
 It's hard.

348
3840.78 --> 3842.78
 Drink it.

349
3842.78 --> 3844.78
 It's better than that.

350
3844.78 --> 3849.20
 I don't think so.

351
3849.20 --> 3851.20
 Why?

352
3851.20 --> 3853.20
 It's fun.

353
3853.20 --> 3856.20
 It's fun, but...

354
3857.20 --> 3859.20
 I'm going to fall asleep.

355
3859.20 --> 3861.20
 Are you okay?

356
3861.20 --> 3863.20
 Are you okay?

357
3863.20 --> 3865.20
 I'm going to take a bath.

358
3889.73 --> 3892.94
 Are you okay?

359
3892.94 --> 3894.94
 I'm sorry.

360
3894.94 --> 3896.94
 I think I'm drunk.

361
3896.94 --> 3897.94
 It's okay.

362
4035.48 --> 4051.66
 Brother.

363
4051.66 --> 4053.66
 I...

364
4053.66 --> 4056.66
 I made you do something wrong.

365
4059.66 --> 4061.66
 Sister.

366
4062.66 --> 4064.66
 Sister.

367
4064.66 --> 4067.66
 I've done something terrible.

368
4177.86 --> 4179.86
 I'm sorry.

369
4191.69 --> 4193.69
 I feel good.

370
4236.80 --> 4257.10
 I feel good.

371
4284.07 --> 4404.44
 I feel good.

372
4435.99 --> 4441.73
 Sister.

373
4454.45 --> 4457.96
 Sister.

374
4464.84 --> 4466.84
 I feel good.

375
4469.84 --> 4471.84
 I feel good.

376
4476.84 --> 4478.84
 I feel good.

377
4479.84 --> 4481.84
 I feel bad.

378
4487.01 --> 4489.01
 Sister.

379
4490.01 --> 4493.64
 I feel good.

380
4501.12 --> 4503.12
 I'm getting a scar.

381
4505.12 --> 4507.12
 I feel good.

382
4512.12 --> 4514.12
 I feel bad.

383
4514.12 --> 4518.71
 Honey.

384
4518.71 --> 4520.71
 I don't have a scar.

385
4520.71 --> 4522.71
 I'm sorry, but bring it to me.

386
4524.71 --> 4525.71
 Okay.

387
4525.71 --> 4636.03
 I'll be right there.

388
4636.03 --> 4638.03
 Sister.

389
4638.03 --> 4642.79
 I'm sorry about that.

390
4642.79 --> 4644.79
 Brother.

391
4644.79 --> 4646.79
 I wanted to feel better.

392
4646.79 --> 4729.27
 It was hard.

393
4938.90 --> 4940.90
 I feel good.

394
4945.90 --> 4964.76
 It's hot.

395
4964.76 --> 4985.64
 I feel bad.

396
5044.48 --> 5046.48
 I was going to have a good meal.

397
5046.48 --> 5048.48
 But you're in a hurry.

398
5048.48 --> 5050.48
 I have no choice.

399
5050.48 --> 5052.48
 I'm in a hurry.

400
5054.48 --> 5057.48
 What happened to your boyfriend?

401
5057.48 --> 5059.48
 My boyfriend?

402
5060.48 --> 5062.48
 He broke up with me.

403
5062.48 --> 5064.48
 Really?

404
5066.48 --> 5068.48
 He's not as reliable as I thought.

405
5069.48 --> 5072.48
 He's young and handsome.

406
5074.99 --> 5079.99
 I wanted a man who was kind and reliable.

407
5079.99 --> 5081.99
 Like my brother.

408
5081.99 --> 5083.99
 Tatsuya?

409
5083.99 --> 5085.99
 I don't know.

410
5085.99 --> 5087.99
 I don't know yet.

411
5088.99 --> 5093.88
 I think he's a good brother.

412
5104.03 --> 5106.03
 It's hot.

413
5107.03 --> 5109.03
 I'm getting ready.

414
5114.17 --> 5116.17
 I'm ready.

415
5119.17 --> 5121.17
 Hey.

416
5121.17 --> 5123.17
 That's not true.

417
5127.25 --> 5129.25
 It's hard work.

418
5130.25 --> 5132.25
 I'm fine.

419
5133.25 --> 5135.25
 Really?

420
5135.25 --> 5138.63
 I'm glad.

421
5146.96 --> 5147.96
 Emi.

422
5147.96 --> 5149.96
 What's wrong?

423
5149.96 --> 5170.55
 Where's Mirei?

424
5170.55 --> 5200.04
 I'm sorry.

425
5200.04 --> 5201.04
 Hello.

426
5201.04 --> 5203.04
 Mirei.

427
5203.04 --> 5205.04
 I didn't ask you to go on a business trip.

428
5205.04 --> 5207.04
 I'm sorry.

429
5207.04 --> 5216.81
 Why are you always like this?

430
5217.81 --> 5219.81
 You should have told me in advance.

431
5220.81 --> 5222.81
 We're a couple.

432
5223.81 --> 5225.81
 We're a couple.

433
5225.81 --> 5238.08
 We have a history.

434
5238.08 --> 5241.59
 A history?

435
5241.59 --> 5242.59
 Yes.

436
5242.59 --> 5247.59
 That's a very old idea.

437
5247.59 --> 5248.59
 What?

438
5248.59 --> 5251.59
 Women have the right to work.

439
5251.59 --> 5254.59
 Women have the right to work.

440
5254.59 --> 5255.59
 But...

441
5255.59 --> 5257.59
 I work.

442
5257.59 --> 5260.59
 So I can rent a big apartment in Tokyo.

443
5260.59 --> 5262.59
 We have money.

444
5262.59 --> 5265.59
 So we can go on a business trip regularly.

445
5265.59 --> 5267.59
 Do you understand that?

446
5267.59 --> 5270.59
 I'm grateful for that.

447
5270.59 --> 5272.59
 Right?

448
5272.59 --> 5276.59
 We have to have a baby soon.

449
5276.59 --> 5279.59
 It's a man's idea.

450
5279.59 --> 5281.59
 Do you understand that?

451
5281.59 --> 5291.52
 No.

452
5291.52 --> 5293.52
 What's the story?

453
5293.52 --> 5294.52
 What?

454
5294.52 --> 5301.52
 I heard rumors about you.

455
5301.52 --> 5302.52
 No...

456
5302.52 --> 5304.52
 I think so.

457
5304.52 --> 5306.52
 I think so.

458
5306.52 --> 5311.52
 You're not a good man.

459
5311.52 --> 5312.52
 I'm not...

460
5312.52 --> 5314.52
 You'll get a scolding.

461
5314.52 --> 5316.52
 No.

462
5316.52 --> 5324.15
 Am I the one who's cheating more often?

463
5324.15 --> 5332.84
 We're both working.

464
5332.84 --> 5333.84
 I'm sorry.

465
5333.84 --> 5340.35
 Hey, it's okay.

466
5340.35 --> 5341.35
 Yes.

467
5341.35 --> 5349.67
 But I thought I'd try a little harder.

468
5349.67 --> 5352.67
 You were so cute when you were a freshman.

469
5355.75 --> 5357.75
 Emi, what are you doing?

470
5357.75 --> 5361.75
 I think you're cheating.

471
5362.75 --> 5365.75
 I think that's cheating.

472
5365.75 --> 5366.75
 What?

473
5367.55 --> 5379.00
 Can you forgive me?

474
5379.00 --> 5395.62
 I can't forgive you.

475
5395.62 --> 5398.06
 Emi.

476
5398.06 --> 5401.06
 You're an actor.

477
5401.06 --> 5407.42
 I don't know how good you are.

478
5407.42 --> 5412.42
 I know a lot of good things about you.

479
5429.56 --> 5437.10
 Do you love me?

480
5437.10 --> 5441.50
 That's...

481
5443.50 --> 5447.90
 Ah.

482
5453.28 --> 5455.28
 Do you love me?

483
5455.28 --> 5457.28
 I love you.

484
5458.28 --> 5461.28
 If you love me, love me.

485
5461.28 --> 5463.28
 Emi.

486
5469.28 --> 5480.34
 This feels good.

487
5496.39 --> 5501.49
 Do you love me?

488
5501.49 --> 5502.49
 I love you.

489
5502.49 --> 5517.07
 I'm glad.

490
5517.87 --> 5519.87
 Ah.

491
5519.87 --> 5521.87
 I'm sorry, but...

492
5521.87 --> 5525.87
 I'm more confident in loving you than you are.

493
5526.87 --> 5528.87
 Emi.

494
5528.87 --> 5529.87
 Ah.

495
5529.87 --> 5534.01
 This feels good.

496
5535.01 --> 5543.36
 You didn't do anything for me.

497
5544.36 --> 5546.36
 That's right.

498
5546.36 --> 5547.36
 That's right.

499
5547.36 --> 5549.36
 That's right.

500
5549.36 --> 5551.36
 Emi.

501
5555.36 --> 5557.36
 Ah.

502
5557.36 --> 5559.36
 Ah.

503
5559.36 --> 5561.36
 Ah.

504
5562.36 --> 5568.36
 If you don't like it, I'll let you touch me.

505
5570.36 --> 5572.36
 Emi.

506
5574.36 --> 5576.36
 Ah.

507
5578.36 --> 5588.04
 Where do you like it now?

508
5599.19 --> 5600.19
 Emi.

509
5604.41 --> 5606.41
 It's so sweet.

510
5606.41 --> 5662.50
 I want to feel better.

511
5662.50 --> 5670.87
 Me too.

512
5671.87 --> 5681.43
 I can only think about you.

513
5683.43 --> 5700.81
 When I think about you, I feel hot.

514
5720.98 --> 5721.98
 Ah.

515
5721.98 --> 5724.36
 Ah.

516
5724.36 --> 5725.36
 Ah.

517
5725.36 --> 5726.36
 Ah.

518
5726.36 --> 5727.36
 Ah.

519
5727.36 --> 5739.82
 It feels good.

520
5739.82 --> 5742.20
 Ah.

521
5742.20 --> 5743.20
 Ah.

522
5743.20 --> 5744.20
 Ah.

523
5745.20 --> 5746.20
 Ah.

524
5746.20 --> 5747.20
 No.

525
5747.20 --> 5751.70
 You can't slap your big brother.

526
5775.93 --> 5778.93
 You are a mess.

527
5815.08 --> 5823.36
 Remember this is about me.

528
5823.36 --> 5825.36
 Emi.

529
5825.36 --> 5826.36
 Emi.

530
5830.65 --> 5831.65
 Enchi.

531
5831.65 --> 5833.65
 Hahaha.

532
5833.65 --> 5835.65
 What a mess...

533
5837.63 --> 5839.63
 There's too much in there...

534
5839.85 --> 5841.85
 I can't get it out...

535
5842.09 --> 5843.57
 Uwaaa

536
5843.83 --> 5845.83
 Aw...

537
5847.05 --> 5849.05
 Check it out...

538
5849.59 --> 5891.69
 How can I eat this...?

539
5892.17 --> 5914.52
 OMG...

540
5915.06 --> 5917.06
 It's so good...

541
5917.90 --> 5919.90
 Oh, come on...

542
5921.20 --> 5923.20
 Should I...

543
5923.20 --> 5925.20
 It's so good.

544
5958.62 --> 5961.62
 It feels so good.

545
5966.62 --> 5967.62
 It's so good.

546
6002.05 --> 6005.05
 I'm so glad you like it.

547
6005.05 --> 6007.05
 Did it hurt?

548
6012.05 --> 6014.05
 It feels so good.

549
6018.05 --> 6029.34
 You don't have to worry about me.

550
6030.34 --> 6031.34
 I'm fine.

551
6043.34 --> 6052.34
 I'll support you a lot.

552
6073.34 --> 6089.10
 Show me how you feel.

553
6116.75 --> 6118.75
 Let's do a lot of good things.

554
6124.75 --> 6125.75
 It feels so good.

555
6179.15 --> 6180.15
 It's hot.

556
6224.98 --> 6237.27
 It's so good.

557
6245.27 --> 6260.19
 I'm so proud of you.

558
6267.63 --> 6271.63
 I want to make you happy.

559
6292.35 --> 6293.35
 It's hot.

560
6304.78 --> 6306.78
 It feels so good.

561
6310.78 --> 6313.78
 I'm full of you.

562
6338.69 --> 6339.69
 It feels so good.

563
6404.26 --> 6405.26
 It's hot.

564
6515.64 --> 6516.64
 It's in the water.

565
6578.70 --> 6586.52
 I can't see it.

566
6588.52 --> 6589.52
 I can't see it.

567
6591.52 --> 6592.52
 I can't see it.

568
6692.11 --> 6693.11
 It's so good.

569
6695.11 --> 6696.11
 It's hot.

570
6701.09 --> 6702.09
 It's hot.

571
6706.09 --> 6707.09
 I love you.

572
6711.09 --> 6713.09
 I want to be with you forever.

573
6759.98 --> 6760.98
 It's hot.

574
6764.98 --> 6765.98
 It's hot.

575
6804.43 --> 6805.43
 It's too hot.

576
6808.43 --> 6809.43
 It's hot.

577
6814.43 --> 6815.43
 It's hot.

578
6831.01 --> 6832.01
 It's so good.

579
6833.01 --> 6834.01
 I can't see it.

580
6836.01 --> 6837.01
 It's hot.

581
6918.38 --> 6919.38
 It's hot.

582
6921.38 --> 6944.81
 I love you.

583
6968.10 --> 6969.10
 It's hot.

584
6972.10 --> 6977.03
 It's hot.

585
6994.98 --> 6995.98
 It's so good.

586
7002.06 --> 7003.06
 It's hot.

587
7004.06 --> 7005.06
 It's hot.

588
7006.06 --> 7007.06
 It's hot.

589
7051.58 --> 7052.58
 Why?

590
7063.69 --> 7065.69
 You wanted to let it out, didn't you?

591
7068.69 --> 7069.69
 Sister.

592
7076.69 --> 7078.69
 I'm a selfish person.

593
7080.69 --> 7084.69
 I don't want to work.

594
7087.69 --> 7093.06
 Then, I'll do it for you.

595
7095.06 --> 7096.06
 Ebichu.

596
7097.06 --> 7098.06
 Ebichu.

597
7114.39 --> 7117.39
 I'm so happy to have you.

598
7122.39 --> 7123.39
 You're so cool.

599
7124.39 --> 7134.07
 You're still in my ears.

600
7165.23 --> 7171.21
 I'm so happy to have you.
