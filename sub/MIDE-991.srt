1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, then let's sit here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's been a while since we've met like this.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, that's right.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, it's been a while since I saw a guy with you two.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, really?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How's your college life going recently?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey, did you make a boyfriend with a circle?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, I didn't.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, I see.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have a crush on someone.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's a secret. What about you, Shin-chan?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I...

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I wanted to end the days that I regret.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nana-chan!

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What is it?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're childhood friends, so we might be in trouble if we suddenly say something like this, but I like Nana-chan.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please go out with me.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait for me!

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's okay.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The person I like is Shin-chan.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,060
Shingen!

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,460
Shien!

27
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,380
I'm sorry, lyrics were a little strange.

28
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,680
Did I do something wrong?

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,380
No, you didn't.

30
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,180
Oh...

31
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,080
Then,

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,580
will you take me home, my boyfriend?

33
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,080
Oh, yeah. Of course.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Come on.

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
She was the first girlfriend I had.

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
I've been with Nana since I was in elementary school.

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
We went to different schools at the university.

38
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,080
I've been thinking about Nana all the time.

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
All the time.

40
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
All the time...

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Nana-chan...

42
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
The day when there was no class in the morning

43
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
I looked at the SNS like this

44
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
The next day, it was the third day that I was going to tell a story about a woman.

45
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm going to tell a story about a woman?

46
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
That's good.

47
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,080
That's good. I'm not going to tell a story about her.

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
It's a good memory.

49
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
This voice...

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,080
I will never forget this voice.

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Hey, come here!

52
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Stop it!

53
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Shinji, you may be familiar with her.

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
But she is my girl.

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm your girlfriend, and I'm your boyfriend.

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Don't act like you don't know.

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Okay.

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Stop it.

59
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
You were just talking to Sen-chan.

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Let's go.

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Sen-chan.

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Sen-chan.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm sorry, Sen-chan.

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Sen-chan.

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:57,300
The

66
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
It's close.

67
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
It's good.

68
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
It's so close.

69
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
It's good.

70
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,300
I'm going to stand up a little more.

71
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
I feel good.

72
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Do this.

73
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Ok

74
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,080
Feels good.

75
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,300
She is really cute.

76
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,300
I am eating...

77
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,980
Are you imitating me?

78
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
You feel good now?

79
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Yes.

80
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
You really feel like a human being.

81
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Yes.

82
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
You're already wet, aren't you?

83
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
You're already wet, aren't you?

84
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,980
You're already wet, aren't you?

85
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,980
I'm going to take a deep breath.

86
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Are you getting tired?

87
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
No, I'm not.

88
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Don't say that.

89
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Raise your hips.

90
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
Move your hands.

91
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,980
Your hips are running away.

92
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Are you okay?

93
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
I feel good.

94
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
You don't have to run away.

95
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
What is that?

96
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Don't lick it.

97
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Why?

98
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
You haven't taken a shower yet, have you?

99
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Oh, I see.

100
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Do you want to take a bath?

101
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Stop it.

102
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Can I put it in?

103
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Do you feel good?

104
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,980
I don't feel good

105
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,980
Do you feel good?

106
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,980
No

107
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Look over there

108
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,980
No, no

109
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Do you feel like giving up?

110
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Stay here

111
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
I feel like giving up

112
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Then let's take it as it is

113
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Show it to me.

114
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Show me your face.

115
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
Show me your eyes.

116
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm scared.

117
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
I'm scared.

118
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,980
I'm scared.

119
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,980
What's the next one?

120
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
You can do it, right?

121
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
It's so cold.

122
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
It's so cold.

123
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
It hurts.

124
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm sorry.

125
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm sorry.

126
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
I'm sorry.

127
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
I'm sorry.

128
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Wait

129
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,580
No

130
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,080
What?

131
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,280
No, no, no

132
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,120
Why?

133
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,380
I'll do it

134
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Nana, look at me.

135
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Show me your face.

136
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
You're so cute.

137
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
You're so cute.

138
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
You're so cute.

139
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
You're so cute.

140
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
You're so cute.

141
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
It hurts!

142
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
It hurts!

143
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
I feel good.

144
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,380
I feel good.

145
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,380
I feel good too.

146
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
I feel good.

147
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
You scared me.

148
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
You scared me so much.

149
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
I'll give it to you.

150
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,380
Go to sleep.

151
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,380
You're still young, aren't you?

152
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,840
I can't do this anymore.

153
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,300
I can't do this anymore.

154
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Are you okay?

155
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
I can't do this anymore.

156
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,100
I can't do this anymore.

157
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Stop it.

158
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,380
Just a little more.

159
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,380
It feels good, doesn't it?

160
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
What is this?

161
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
I'm sorry.

162
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,080
Please give me that!

163
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,100
YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

164
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,160
YES!! YES! YES!

165
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,760
So cute.

166
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,020
See?

167
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,580
Aww!

168
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,140
It was IV residue.

169
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,320
I need to drink water...

170
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,120
What?

171
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
Don't drink too much.

172
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,940
Goodbye.

173
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
But take...

174
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,780
Let's go.

175
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,900
You want to drink too?

176
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,720
Why are you drinking mouthwash?

177
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,700
It's hot!

178
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,680
You should breathe less.

179
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,140
It's okay, I can handle it.

180
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm...

181
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
How did it feel?

182
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Huh?

183
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Hey, Soso, show me your hand.

184
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Hurry, hurry.

185
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Give me a kiss.

186
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Huh?

187
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
What's wrong?

188
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Stop it.

189
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Why?

190
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Aika...

191
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Nana.

192
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Hey, isn't it boring to be with me?

193
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry.

194
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,400
It's our first date.

195
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Oh, yeah.

196
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm so nervous.

197
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,400
That video makes me lose my mind.

198
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
I see.

199
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
It's been a long time since I've seen her.

200
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
What's going on?

201
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
It's been a long time.

202
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Huh?

203
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
There's also Mr. Motokano.

204
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I haven't found out yet that she'd react like that.

205
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
What?

206
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
What are you talking about?

207
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
What are you talking about?

208
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
What are you talking about?

209
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
What are you talking about?

210
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,120
What are you talking about?

211
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,360
Hey, let's take him there.

212
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
Sounds good.

213
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Let's go.

214
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
What?

215
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Come on.

216
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Come on.

217
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
I'm sorry.

218
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Let me go.

219
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm sorry.

220
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Let me go.

221
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I'm sorry.

222
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,280
That was close...

223
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,880
You guys...

224
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,860
I see that you're dating

225
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,440
but are you dating?

226
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,220
Huh?

227
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,720
Are you serious?

228
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,880
That had nothing to do with it...

229
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,360
What?

230
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,260
Cut it out, and tell Shin-chan what happened!

231
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,320
Okay, okay.

232
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,140
I'm not telling you anything.

233
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm gonna go work with his istiyorum.

234
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,040
Sorry, sorry.

235
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
What are you doing?

236
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
What are you doing?

237
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Be quiet.

238
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Yuzu!

239
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Stop it.

240
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Shin-chan!

241
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Be quiet.

242
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Shin-chan, are you okay?

243
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I can't help you.

244
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Let me go.

245
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
I'm going home.

246
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Wait a minute.

247
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Don't look at me.

248
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Look at this video.

249
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
What are you doing?

250
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
You remember, don't you?

251
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,040
I posted this on social media, and people liked it.

252
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Do you understand what I'm saying?

253
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Why are you doing this to me?

254
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
What?

255
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
You're a jerk.

256
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
I see.

257
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
I heard they want to do it with you.

258
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
What?

259
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Hey, Shinji.

260
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Look closely.

261
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Shin-chan.

262
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Stop it.

263
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Stop it.

264
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Shin-chan.

265
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Nana-chan!

266
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Nana-chan!

267
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Stop it!

268
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Stop it!

269
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Hey, hey, where are you going?

270
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Stop it!

271
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

272
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Hey!

273
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
No, no!

274
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
What is it?

275
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Nana-chan!

276
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Nana-chan!

277
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Why?

278
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Give me a kiss.

279
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,040
No! Don't touch me!

280
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
No!

281
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
What are you doing?

282
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Shin-chan!

283
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Shin-chan!

284
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
What are you doing?

285
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I don't want to do it.

286
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
I don't want to do it.

287
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
I don't want to do it.

288
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Come on.

289
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Come on.

290
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Come on.

291
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Hey, what are you doing?

292
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Oh, no.

293
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Are you crying?

294
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
I'm not.

295
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Are you crying?

296
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm not.

297
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm not.

298
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm not.

299
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm not.

300
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm not.

301
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
I'm not.

302
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Wait a minute.

303
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Hey, what's wrong?

304
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Stop it! Stop it!

305
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
What is it?

306
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
What is it?

307
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I'm a loser, so I can't see anything.

308
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Teacher, please help me.

309
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Teacher, please help me.

310
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Did you think I could help you in that situation?

311
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Oh, my God.

312
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Oh, my God.

313
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Stop it.

314
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
I'm in the way.

315
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I'm in the way.

316
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Okay.

317
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
I'm so scared.

318
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Okay.

319
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Look.

320
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
You can do it like this.

321
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
You can do it like this.

322
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
You can do it like this.

323
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
No.

324
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Can you see it clearly?

325
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Don't look at me.

326
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Don't look at me.

327
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Stop it.

328
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
Don't look at me.

329
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Don't look at me.

330
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Stop it.

331
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Really.

332
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Stop it.

333
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Stop it.

334
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Hey, let me go!

335
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Let me go!

336
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't look at me!

337
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Let me go!

338
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Jin-chan!

339
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I'm so sorry!

340
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Jin-chan!

341
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Stop it!

342
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
It's over!

343
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,040
You're so mean.

344
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Show me more.

345
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
No, I don't want to.

346
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Let go of my hand.

347
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Stop it.

348
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,040
You're in the way.

349
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I don't want to do it.

350
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Don't look around.

351
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Don't do it.

352
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Hey, Nana.

353
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Don't do it.

354
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Listen to me. Did you guys do it?

355
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,040
What? It has nothing to do with it!

356
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
What? What did you say?

357
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
You're as sensitive as ever.

358
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
What? You really don't want to?

359
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
No, no, no.

360
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
No?

361
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Hey, let's do it again.

362
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
What is it?

363
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
What is it?

364
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
What is it?

365
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
What is it?

366
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
What is it?

367
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
I'm scared. Stop it.

368
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
You'll understand if you use it.

369
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
What is it?

370
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
You'll understand if you use it.

371
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I'll tell you.

372
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Okay.

373
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Stop it.

374
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
What is it?

375
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
What is this?

376
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
What is this?

377
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Help me!

378
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
You said you would understand if you don't use it.

379
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
What is this?

380
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
What is this?

381
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
It makes me nervous.

382
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Don't do that.

383
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Don't do that.

384
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Wait.

385
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I'll take it right away.

386
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Yuzuru...

387
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
It's okay.

388
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
You're becoming more sensitive.

389
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Don't cry.

390
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
This is amazing, isn't it?

391
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Stop it.

392
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Your skin is just like this.

393
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Don't touch me.

394
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Stop it.

395
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Don't touch me.

396
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Don't touch me anymore.

397
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
It feels good, isn't it?

398
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,040
I won't lose. Forgive me.

399
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Here too, right?

400
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Does it feel good?

401
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
No!

402
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
Shin-chan!

403
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Shin-chan!

404
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
Shin-chan.

405
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Don't do that anymore.

406
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
You can put this on.

407
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I don't like it. Stop it.

408
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
Please be quiet.

409
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Please be quiet.

410
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Please be quiet.

411
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
It doesn't make any sense, does it?

412
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Oh, I see.

413
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Stop it, stop it.

414
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,040
You just said it, didn't you?

415
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
I told you, didn't I?

416
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Ouch!

417
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
It's hot!

418
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Are you okay?

419
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Come on, let's go.

420
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Stop it!

421
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Stop it!

422
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
Stop it!

423
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,640
If you take the medicine, you'll lose your strength.

424
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:17,040
Hey, Shinji, it feels good to be hit by Chimpanzee's nipple.

425
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I can't stop, I can't stop.

426
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,040
She is happy.

427
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
I'm sorry.

428
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
I'm sorry.

429
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
I'm sorry.

430
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,040
It's getting better.

431
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,040
This way, this way.

432
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Hush.

433
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Stop it.

434
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
You're so annoying.

435
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Stop it.

436
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
I told you to stop it.

437
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
I can't do it anymore.

438
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
Let's do it again.

439
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Open your mouth.

440
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
Oh, right.

441
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,040
When you're eating, make sure to use a rubber band.

442
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
It's easier for me.

443
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,040
Right.

444
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
Come on, eat.

445
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Give it to me.

446
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
It's not heavy at all.

447
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Do you want to use this?

448
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
Yes, let's use it.

449
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
It's heavy.

450
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,460
Don't do something like that to my daughter!

451
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,420
Hey hey hey.

452
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,420
What are you doing?

453
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,420
Get on the chair.

454
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,420
I can't do it anymore.

455
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,420
I feel so good.

456
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,420
Stop it.

457
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,420
I'll let you do it normally.

458
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,420
Come on, let's go.

459
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,420
That feels good.

460
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,420
You're reacting, aren't you?

461
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,420
Stop it.

462
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,420
Don't panic.

463
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,420
This is amazing.

464
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,420
It's so tight.

465
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,420
Is the room closed?

466
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,420
This guy is going.

467
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,420
What's wrong?

468
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,420
I told you, didn't I?

469
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,420
Shinji, I told you again!

470
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,420
What? What?

471
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,760
Kaede, come.

472
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,520
Thank you.

473
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,080
No.

474
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,180
Okay.

475
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,880
Why no one wants to debut?

476
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,760
Hey, wait.

477
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,000
Even if you do this...

478
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Shin-chan, can you help me?

479
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Stand up, stand up.

480
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Shin-chan, don't sleep.

481
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Shin-chan, don't sleep.

482
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Shin-chan, don't sleep.

483
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Shin-chan, don't sleep.

484
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Please don't hurt me!

485
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm going to get angry.

486
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Do it.

487
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Don't look at me.

488
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Please don't hurt my head.

489
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I'll show you how it's done.

490
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's big.

491
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's big.

492
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's big.

493
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's big.

494
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's big.

495
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's big.

496
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's big.

497
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's too big.

498
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's too big.

499
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's too big.

500
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
It's too big.

501
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's too small.

502
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
What is it?

503
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Here you go.

504
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Beautiful.

505
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Here you go.

506
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
He doesn't move at all.

507
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
What's wrong with you?

510
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
What's wrong with you?

512
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Oh, I feel it too much.

514
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm so surprised.

515
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
What?

517
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Stop it.

518
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Are you sure you want to stop?

519
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

520
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You look happy.

521
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Are you okay?

522
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

523
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I can't do it.

524
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I can't do it.

525
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I'll get you out of here.

526
01:02:37,000 --> 01:03:04,000
The thirty years have come and the

527
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,160
Oh...

528
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:42,160
Oh...

529
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,160
Oh...

530
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,160
Oh...

531
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,160
Oh...

532
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,160
Oh...

533
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,160
Oh...

534
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,160
Why are you crying?

535
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,160
What?

536
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,160
Are you crying?

537
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,160
Look.

538
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,160
It's been a while since we've seen each other.

539
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,160
I'm sorry.

540
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,160
I'm sorry.

541
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,160
I'm sorry.

542
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,160
I'm so tired.

543
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,160
Open your mouth.

544
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,320
You're about to faint, ZO-Sensei.

545
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,800
Seisuke...

546
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:51,320
I'm sorry, sis.

547
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,160
I'm sorry, sis.

548
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,620
I couldn't get in touch with Nana for a while.

549
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:15,620
I got a call from her just two weeks later.

550
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,620
I'm sorry.

551
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,620
Come on in.

552
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:48,620
I'm sorry for not being able to do anything, Nana-chan.

553
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:55,620
What should I do?

554
01:08:55,620 --> 01:09:01,620
What should I do?

555
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:30,620
I'll protect you, I'll always protect you.

556
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,620
Thank you.

557
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,620
It's been a while.

558
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:47,620
I wish everyone around me was like you.

559
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:52,620
I wish all the men were like you, Sen-chan.

560
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,620
I love you.

561
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,620
Can I take it off?

562
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,860
I put on my underwear and shorts.

563
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,240
How was that?

564
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,000
It was comfortable.

565
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,500
Really?

566
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,500
What are you doing?

567
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,500
You're good friend.

568
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,940
It feel good

569
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,540
It feel good

570
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,540
My heart...

571
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,540
I'll do it for you, too.

572
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:26,680
Nez

573
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,600
I'm sorry. I was nervous.

574
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:27,760
Nana-chan...

575
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,760
It hurts, doesn't it?

576
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,520
Feel good.

577
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,760
...

578
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,980
He's gone.

579
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,980
Don't worry about it.

580
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,980
Shin-chan?

581
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,980
Just like that.

582
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:06,980
Shin-chan?

583
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:10,680
Wait, Aiku, Aiku!

584
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,600
What's wrong, Shin-chan?

585
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,940
I'm sorry, Nana-chan.

586
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:38,840
The pillow is too tight.

587
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,940
Neko...

588
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,320
I'm really sorry.

589
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:22,320
I just wanted to see it with my erotic eyes.

590
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,320
I just wanted to see it with my erotic eyes.

591
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:34,320
I really wanted to taste the excitement of that moment again.

592
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,320
Hey.

593
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,320
Hey.

594
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,320
You're here.

595
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:20,320
Are you sure you're going to delete the video?

596
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,320
I want to ask you something.

597
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,320
What is it?

598
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,320
I remember.

599
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:46,320
Are you going to use that again?

600
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,320
Stop it! Stop it!

601
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,320
I'm sorry, Yuna-chan.

602
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,320
I'm sorry.

603
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,320
I'm sorry.

604
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,320
You're not going to leave again?

605
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,320
I'm sorry.

606
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:23,320
This is the 7th try, isn't it?

607
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,320
That's right.

608
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,320
I can't believe it's the 5th try.

609
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,320
That's too much.

610
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,320
What's the matter?

611
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,320
What's the matter?

612
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,320
I'm sorry.

613
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,320
I'll make sure you get hit.

614
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,320
I'll make sure you get hit.

615
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,320
I'll make sure you get hit.

616
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,320
I'm going to hit you on the head too.

617
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
Come on, come on, come on.

618
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,320
Come on, come on.

619
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,320
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

620
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,320
Hello?

621
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,320
I did what you wanted.

622
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,320
Come here tonight with the money.

623
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,320
I'll show you the best of me.

624
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:38,740
Let's look at the

625
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,260
Where are you, Nana?

626
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:11,740
You're the best, Nana.

627
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.

628
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,740
Nana,

629
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,740
do you have something to tell us?

630
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:39,740
How many times have you been kicked out by us?

631
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,740
I don't know.

632
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,740
I don't know.

633
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:50,740
Please be nice to me today.

634
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,740
I want you to be nice to me.

635
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,740
Please be nice to me.

636
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:59,740
I'll do it for you today.

637
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,740
Are you okay?

638
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:03,940
I will.

639
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,940
Open the door again.

640
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:35,940
It hasn't started yet.

641
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,940
You want to rest, don't you?

642
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:49,940
Come here.

643
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,940
No, no.

644
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,940
Come here, come here.

645
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,940
Come on, come on.

646
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:57,940
No, not that way.

647
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:02,940
I want to go home.

648
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,940
I want to go home.

649
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,940
Are you still kissing?

650
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:42,560
Okay, I know now

651
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,640
How was Iroha's eating?

652
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,520
He always screams

653
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:03,520
Oh, you did it again.

654
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,520
What's wrong with you?

655
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,520
I'm having fun.

656
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,520
What are you having fun?

657
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,520
I can't do it.

658
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,520
What is it?

659
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,520
I can't do it.

660
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,520
You're fast.

661
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
What is it?

662
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,520
It feels so good.

663
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,520
Do you love me?

664
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,520
I love you.

665
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,520
I can see it clearly.

666
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,520
What is it?

667
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,520
Do you want me to kiss you?

668
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,520
Do you want me to kiss you?

669
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,520
Not yet.

670
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,520
You only think about your baby.

671
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,520
You can kiss me with your mouth.

672
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,520
What's going on here?

673
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,520
Oh, my God.

674
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,520
Oh, my God.

675
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,520
Oh, my God.

676
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,520
I can't help but want to see you.

677
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,520
I'm sorry.

678
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,520
It feels good.

679
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,520
You should feel better.

680
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:29,520
Let's get up.

681
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,520
Let's get up.

682
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,520
Let's take a bath together.

683
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,520
It's the same as taking a bath together, isn't it?

684
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,520
It's cold.

685
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:57,520
One more here.

686
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,520
I'll put a handkerchief.

687
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,520
I'll put a handkerchief.

688
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,520
I'm glad you put it in.

689
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,520
I'll put it in.

690
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,520
I'll put it in.

691
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,520
I'm so tired.

692
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,520
Sit down.

693
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,520
Sit down.

694
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,520
Are you okay?

695
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520
Are you okay?

696
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,520
You're feeling good, aren't you?

697
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,520
Yes, I am.

698
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:37,520
Don't go. It's not over yet.

699
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,520
This is the third one.

700
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,520
Can you get up, Nana?

701
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,520
Come here.

702
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,520
Come here.

703
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,520
Come here.

704
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,520
Stand up.

705
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,520
You want me to put you down, don't you?

706
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,520
I'll put you down.

707
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,520
I feel good.

708
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,520
Touch your waist.

709
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,520
I feel good.

710
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,520
I feel good.

711
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,520
Oh, my God.

712
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,520
Oh, my God.

713
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,520
That's how you get out of here.

714
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,520
Oh, my God.

715
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,520
Oh, my God.

716
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,520
Shhh!

717
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,520
Shhh!

718
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,520
Shhh!

719
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,520
Shhh!

720
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,520
Look at her legs.

721
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,520
I'm so tired.

722
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,520
I'm so tired.

723
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,520
Ah!

724
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,520
Ouch!

725
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,520
Ouch!

726
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,520
Ouch!

727
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,520
Ouch!

728
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,520
Ouch!

729
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,520
Ouch!

730
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,520
Come on.

731
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:01,520
Come on.

732
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,520
Come on.

733
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,520
Oh, it's hard.

734
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,520
How many times do I have to tell you this?

735
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,520
Wow.

736
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,520
I'm sorry.

737
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,520
I'm sorry.

738
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,520
I'm sorry.

739
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,520
I'm sorry.

740
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
Come on.

741
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
Get up.

742
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,520
I'm sorry.

743
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,520
Look at the way she's turning around.

744
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,520
She's got blood in her eyes.

745
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,520
I love you, Nemo.

746
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:42,160
I can't breathe

747
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,460
You can see he's shaking

748
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:54,100
It hurts

749
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,100
Are you sure?

750
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:00,100
Will she give another one?

751
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,100
It's moving very fast, like crazy.

752
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,100
Does it feel good?

753
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,100
It hurts.

754
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,100
I can feel it.

755
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,100
It's okay.

756
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:25,100
I'll do another one.

757
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:27,100
It's my butt.

758
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:29,100
Thank you very much.

759
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,100
I can't do it anymore.

760
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:05,100
You can do it.

761
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,100
I can do it.

762
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,100
I can do it.

763
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,100
I can do it.

764
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:17,100
I'm sorry.

765
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,100
I'm sorry.

766
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:25,100
Ouch!

767
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:29,100
Ouch!

768
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,100
I can't do it.

769
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:41,100
I can't do it.

770
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,100
What?

771
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:43,100
I can't do it.

772
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:45,100
Why? Do you want to die?

773
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:48,100
Let's go.

774
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:47,100
I think I can do it.

775
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,100
Huh?

776
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,100
N-N-Nana-chan...

777
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,100
Shin-chan...

778
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,100
N-Nana-chan...

779
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:57,100
Will you come with me?

780
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,100
Yes, I will.

781
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,100
I'm about to die.

782
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,100
Thank you.

783
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:41,100
Hey, Shinji.

784
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:45,100
If you bring money again, I'll make you feel the same way.

785
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,100
Come on, let's go home.

786
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:59,100
I wish all men were like you.

787
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:02,100
I'm sorry, Nana-chan.

788
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:08,100
I am the worst scumbag in the world.

789
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:38,100
Thank you for watching.
