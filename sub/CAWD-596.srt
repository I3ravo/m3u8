1
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,770
Hello?

2
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,190
How is Tokyo?

3
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:41,015
How is your job? Yeah.

4
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,910


5
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,870
You don't have money,
and the hotel is expensive.

6
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,590
I asked Sora's mother to stay
at the hotel, so let me stay there.

7
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,490
No, I'll take the hotel by myself.

8
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,030
You don't have to spend so much money.

9
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,970
But it's okay.
We were good friends when we were little.

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,110
I want you to stop it.

11
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,970
What? No.

12
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,730
Mom? Mom? Come in.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640


14
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,010


15
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:48,855
Long time no see.

16
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,630
Long time no see.

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,380
Long time no see, Aoi.

18
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,300
Long time no see.

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,940
Long time no see.

20
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,580
I haven't seen you for a while.
Are you nervous? No, I'm not.

21
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,970
I'm so happy.

22
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,220
Come in.

23
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,810
Excuse me.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,540
Come in.

25
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940


26
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,000
It's hard to get a job.

27
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:42,380
I have to do it in two years.

28
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,940
I wonder if I should join the
same company as Aoi-kun.

29
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,580
Oh, Suzu, don't be so clingy to Aoi-kun.

30
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,740
It's okay.
It's been a long time since we met.

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,980
You see, Aoi-kun is in trouble, right?

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,620
Oh, my sister was next to
Aoi-kun, so I'm jealous. I'm scared.

33
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
That's not true.

34
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,240
Oh, I'm angry. Aoi-kun, help me.

35
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm really angry.

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Aoi, you say something.

37
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,550
Aoi.

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,310
Where are you going tomorrow?

39
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,650
I'm going to Shinbashi tomorrow.

40
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,870
Shinbashi?

41
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,310
It's a little far from here.

42
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,690
There are a lot of subways
in Tokyo, so it won't take long.

43
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,030
Will you come to Tokyo
when you get a job? I think so.

44
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,770
I see.

45
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,610


46
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,210
What's wrong? Nothing.

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,590


48
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,830
Do you still like my
sister? I don't know.

49
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,610


50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,990
I haven't met her at all.

51
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,570
I didn't like you, and I
don't think I like you, Sora.

52
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,410
Yes, you're a liar.

53
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Today, I'm going to have a
barbeque to celebrate Aoi's new job!

54
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Yay!

55
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,520
Hey, you used to cook
a lot, didn't you? Yeah.

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,020
Let's eat.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's eat.

58
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,080
Itadakimasu.

59
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,560
It's hot.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,160
It's delicious.

61
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
It's delicious.

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880


63
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,180
You'll be fine if you eat vegetables.

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Don't you eat
vegetables? Don't worry.

65
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,720
I have vegetables.

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
I have vegetables.

67
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,740
I'm eating vegetables.

68
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,600
Thank you.

69
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,420
Congratulations on your graduation.

70
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Congratulations.

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,600
Don't eat meat. Eat vegetables.

72
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,040
You can eat grilled meat.

73
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
If you eat grilled meat, it's grilled meat.

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
That's not true.

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
It's true.

76
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,351
I remembered the old days today.

77
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,790
It was fun.

78
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,050
Thank you.

79
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,650
I had fun, too.

80
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,050
Then I'll go to bed soon.

81
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,830
OK.

82
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,190
Good night.

83
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,650
Good night.

84
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,470
Do you still like
Aoi-kun? No, I don't.

85
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,510
You know we're
not dating, right?

86
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,510
So you won't complain
if I date Aoi-kun, right?

87
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,290
With Aoi-kun?

88
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,390
I won't say no, but... There's someone
better than Aoi-kun, right? I like Aoi-kun.

89
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,130
I like Aoi-kun.

90
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:27,430


91
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,750
If you like him so much, you
can confess your love to him.

92
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,170
I'll confess my love to him.

93
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,090
What's wrong?

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
What are you
doing? I like Aoi-kun.

95
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460


96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,940
It's good, isn't
it? No, it's not.

97
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,900
I like Aoi-kun.

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,660
I don't know if it's okay.

99
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,540
Do you still like my
sister? Well, that's.

100
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,580
..

101
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,320
Isn't it good for
me? It's not good.

102
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,780


103
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
But my sister doesn't like Aoi anymore.

104
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
What?

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Really?

106
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,580
I'll make you feel better.

107
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,245
Give it to me.

108
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
No, no, no.

109
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I won't give it to you.

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,680
What are you
doing? Don't do that.

111
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm fine.

112
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460


113
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
What's fine?

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
You don't like it, do you?

115
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:10,240
You don't like it, do
you? It's not good.

116
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,440
It's not good.

117
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
It's all right.

118
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840


119
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I have to tell my sister.

120
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,940
If she finds out, she'll kill me.

121
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,040
It's all right.

122
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,460
My sister doesn't like you.

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
She doesn't care.

124
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,900
It's all right.

125
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:32,901
It's hot.

126
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,240
Be calm.

127
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,850
I can make you feel better.

128
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,090
What do you mean?

129
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,220
Do you feel good?

130
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,090
Are you going to take off your clothes?

131
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:21,970
My boobs are bigger than yours.

132
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,570
You don't have to show them.

133
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,830
Why don't you take
them off? It's hot.

134
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,010


135
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,600
You like bigger boobs, don't you, Aoi?

136
00:10:47,380 --> 00:11:03,680
You are bigger than
your sister, aren't you?

137
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,940
I don't know my sister.

138
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,800
Boys like boobs,
don't they? I like boobs.

139
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,760
It's hot.

140
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,761
Don't do that.

141
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,780


142
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,980
You're standing up.

143
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,080
Don't look at me. It's embarrassing.

144
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,460
Do you want me to pinch you?

145
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:02,581
Do you want me to pinch you?

146
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,440
Pinch you?

147
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:04,760
Yes.

148
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,660
What? Pinch you.

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,660
What? Here.

150
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880


151
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300


152
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:09,920
What? Like this.

153
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240


154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,700
What?

155
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,460
You can pinch me like this.

156
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,240
What? No way.

157
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480


158
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,840
How is it? Oh, no.

159
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910


160
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Wow.

161
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,270
※This video is a derivative
work of Touhou Project.

162
00:12:53,090 --> 00:13:07,370
It's hot, so I'll take it off.

163
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,390
No, stop it.

164
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,950
I'm taking it off.

165
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:12,950
No, no, no.

166
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,491
You'll be seen by the sky...
Are you okay? No, no, no.

167
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060


168
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,650
You're misunderstanding.

169
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,250
You're already asleep, aren't you?

170
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,150
You may wake up.

171
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:25,770
I'm not going to die.

172
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,150
You'll be fine.

173
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,570
I can't do it anymore.

174
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,590
I can't breathe.

175
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,230
But it feels good, doesn't it?

176
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,730
Let's get comfortable together.

177
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:45,180
It's better to touch
you directly, isn't it?

178
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,350
Let us know if you have any questions.

179
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,290
I can't breathe.

180
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,650
Is it good?

181
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,850
I'm suffocating.

182
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,670
It's fun, isn't
it? It's not fun.

183
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,850


184
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:34,720
I'm going to sleep.

185
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,560
Are you going to
sleep? It's okay.

186
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,380
I'm going to sleep.

187
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:45,381
I'm going to sleep.

188
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:23,450
Are you really not going
to wake up? I'll be fine.

189
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,490


190
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,630
Really? I'll be fine.

191
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,670


192
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,130
Aren't you light? I'll be fine.

193
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,110


194
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,790
What will you do when you wake up?

195
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,890
I don't like waking up, so I'll be fine.

196
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm going to make a cup of coffee.

197
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,700
I'm going to make a cup of coffee.

198
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,410
I'm going to make a cup of coffee.

199
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,060
No, no, no.

200
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,840
I think my sister will scold me.

201
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,250
Please turn down the volume.

202
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,280
I'm going to faint.

203
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,450
Are you okay? I'm okay.

204
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,790


205
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,950
Can you hold your voice?

206
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,910
I'll do my best.

207
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,490
No, I can't.

208
00:21:13,120 --> 00:22:11,370
I love your voice.

209
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,950
I can't hold my voice.

210
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,490
No, you can't.

211
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:17,110
It's over.

212
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:18,111
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

213
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
It's okay.

214
00:22:39,975 --> 00:23:08,650
You're my childhood friend.

215
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,270
Why?

216
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,230
You're not?

217
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:12,231
What?

218
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,830
You don't like Aoi, I like Aoi.

219
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,190
So, I can have an affair with you.

220
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,530
What?

221
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,350
An affair?

222
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,530
Yes.

223
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,500
It's just you two.

224
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,620
Are you OK? I'll put more.

225
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,840
No, you can't.

226
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000


227
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,090
Ai-chan, you can't.

228
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:53,360
Ai-chan, you look so comfortable.

229
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,210
Ai-chan, you'll wake up.

230
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,090
Don't touch my hips.

231
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:58,970
I have your hips.

232
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,680
Then, I'll touch your hips.

233
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
Do you want to
attack me? Attack you.

234
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
I feel good.

235
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,450


236
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
Do you feel good? I feel good.

237
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Don't move.

238
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,650
Look at me.

239
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,781
What? Look at me.

240
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240


241
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,910
Can you see me?

242
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,210
Do you feel good?
I feel so good.

243
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,700


244
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,380
Do you feel good? I feel sick.

245
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
I feel sick.

246
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,720
I feel sick.

247
00:31:51,030 --> 00:32:28,540
I can't speak.

248
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:56,010


249
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,750
Shut your mouth.

250
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,480
I can't speak.

251
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,180
I feel sick.

252
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,630
It feels good.

253
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,410
I love you.

254
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,240
Hang in there.

255
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:01,040
I love you.

256
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,240
It feels so good.

257
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:58,340
I'm going to cry.

258
00:38:24,430 --> 00:39:03,560
It's true that I like you, Aoi.

259
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,430
Let's eat.

260
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:24,710
Thank you for the meal.

261
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,990
Thank you for the meal.

262
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,790
Oh, I forgot that I have a class today.

263
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
I'll take this.

264
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,610
OK.

265
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,290
Now I'm motivated.

266
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,110
See you.

267
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,290
See you.

268
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,400
You get along well with Suzu.

269
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:54,041
You two get along pretty well, don't you?

270
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,620
What do you mean?

271
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,080
You're bold, aren't you?

272
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,600
You didn't say anything to me.

273
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,341
Don't be silent and say something.

274
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,880
You didn't say anything to me, either.

275
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,460
You know that, don't you?

276
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,280
I know, but I don't know.

277
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,740
If you don't know, say it!

278
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:27,741
Come out!

279
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
I told you!

280
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,450
I've always loved you.

281
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Me too.

282
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:45,885
You're so cute.

283
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,430
You too.

284
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,770
You hurt me a lot.

285
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,910
You too, right?

286
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,630
Wait, I'm not that big.

287
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,710
Why? I'm not that big.

288
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,270
It doesn't matter.

289
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:15,200
I'm not saying that.

290
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,720
Show me.

291
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:34,205
It's difficult.

292
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,150
What are you talking about?

293
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,410
I'm taking off my shirt.

294
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,871
I'm going to take you to
the vet for your condition.

295
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,846
I'm not going to take you to the vet today.

296
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:49,780
Of course, I'll take you to
the vet for more information.

297
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:49,820
I've been taking the cat to
the vet for about a month.

298
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:54,380
It's been a month since the vet
came, and now he's coughing.

299
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:55,946
This is a video of me eating a baby's food.

300
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:51,000
It's hot, so I put it in my mouth.

301
00:48:51,100 --> 00:49:00,210
I'm sorry.

302
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:04,250
I'm sorry, but I have to eat it.

303
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,380
I'm sorry.

304
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:08,381
I love you.

305
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,920
I love you.

306
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:55,220
I don't know.

307
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,020
It smells good.

308
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
It feels good.

309
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:40,030
Do you like this?

310
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,220
It looks painful.

311
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,780
You look like you feel good.

312
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,070
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

313
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,150
My baby.

314
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,180


315
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,060
Do you want to quit? I love you.

316
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:17,310
I love you.

317
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,770


318
00:58:33,440 --> 00:59:18,500
It feels so good.

319
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,050
It's so hot.

320
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:18,550
I feel sick.

321
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,130
But I can't move.

322
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:34,940
幼稚園生徒たちのパパは、運動会にビックリした。
その時、パパは、貧血を感じている。

323
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,200
パパは、遺伝子でも、明らかに貧血を感じている。
I'm sorry.

324
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,700


325
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,380
It's painful, isn't
it? I'm sorry.

326
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,490
I'm sorry.

327
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,040
It's painful.

328
01:08:22,455 --> 01:08:47,610
I'm sorry.

329
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,020
I'm sorry.

330
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,660
I'm sorry.

331
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,700


332
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,390
What a pain!

333
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:25,810
I'm sorry that I woke you up.

334
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,500
47

335
01:11:42,390 --> 01:12:07,540
I'm going to go too.

336
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,010
Hey, Aoi, let's go to the
convenience store after this.

337
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,890
I want to go with you.

338
01:13:11,005 --> 01:13:12,670
You have a little homework, don't you?

339
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,446
Wouldn't it be better
to go with three people?

340
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,010
No, no, no, it's an important time.

341
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:17,670
Shopping.

342
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,530
Hey, Aoi, you want to
go with me, don't you?

343
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,930
You want to go with me,
don't you? Leave it to me.

344
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,650


345
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:24,950
Why?

346
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:26,731
Aoi-kun, do you want to eat strawberries?

347
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:27,990
Yes.

348
01:13:34,345 --> 01:13:38,360
I feel like my sister is going to do it.

349
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,920
I can't help it.

350
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,120
Did you see my condensed milk attack?

351
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,820
Is it delicious?

352
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:46,340
Yes.

353
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:51,220
Aoi-kun, I want to eat
strawberries with condensed milk.

354
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,260
Condensed milk?

355
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,520
Yes.

356
01:13:54,805 --> 01:14:13,190
It's sweet.

357
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,330
What? You can eat strawberries on your own!

358
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,430
You said you don't like strawberries
with condensed milk, didn't you, Suzu?

359
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,810
Oh, so that's what you do, Suzu.

360
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:29,830
Hey, Aoi-kun, I want to eat
strawberries with condensed milk, too.

361
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,470
Put it on, put it on.

362
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,440
Aoi-kun.

363
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:48,880
I'll give you half.

364
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:49,881
I love you.

365
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:56,040
Hey, it's great. Let me eat it too.

366
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,600
I want it too.

367
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,740
You give it to me first, right?

368
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,540
I want to eat it with condensed milk.

369
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,580
Let me eat.

370
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,010
Say ah.

371
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,160
I want it too.

372
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,500
Hey.

373
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:22,190
What's going on?
You said you didn't like Aoi.

374
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,290
I did, but I don't anymore.

375
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,930
Why? I don't get it.

376
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:30,070
You said you liked me.

377
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,570
I did, didn't I?

378
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,830
No, you said you liked me.

379
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,250
I did, didn't I?

380
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,050
Aoi?

381
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,210
What time is it?

382
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:38,810
Aoi? I'm in a hurry.

383
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,190


384
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,670
Hey!

385
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,046
I'm going to take a bath and go to bed.

386
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,070
Hey!

387
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:45,990
What's going on?

388
01:15:45,991 --> 01:15:48,470
What is that?

389
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,970
I can't believe it.

390
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,090
I don't know what it means.

391
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,410
What is that? I know.

392
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,230
It's annoying.

393
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:55,890
I know.

394
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:56,630
Let's go.

395
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,110
Let's go.

396
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,350


397
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,430
I don't like it.

398
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:02,230
I don't like it.

399
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:03,370
I don't like it.

400
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,260
Hey, what are you doing?

401
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,540
Why are you in
the bath? Get out.

402
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:13,360
Get out.

403
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,520
It's not the time
to be in the bath.

404
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:16,521
It's not like that.

405
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:24,440
Let me make it clear.

406
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,000
It's time to put on black and white.

407
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,040
It's not a little.

408
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,460
Don't choose properly.

409
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,300
Which do you choose,
me or Suzu? I can't choose.

410
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,000


411
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
Can't you choose? No, I can't.

412
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,260


413
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,620
Really?

414
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:41,920
I love both of them.

415
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,500
What? What? No way.

416
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:46,640


417
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,501
It's not like that.

418
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,320
It's not like putting them in order.

419
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:58,891
Which one do you like
better? Both are good.

420
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,680


421
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:01,880
Both are good, right?

422
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,840
Chinchin is the one you like better, right?

423
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,930
I like mine better.

424
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:29,640
It's been a while since I've had a baby, so
I'm worried about how the baby will react.

425
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,526
It's been a while since I had a baby, so
I'm worried about how the baby will react.

426
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,909
I've been taking care of
the baby since last year, and

427
01:17:36,921 --> 01:17:39,380
I'm worried about whether
I'll be able to raise my baby.

428
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:15,877
It is said that if you eat a lot of sweets, you will be able to eat a lot of sweets

429
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,720
OK!

430
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,700
I'm going to put it in a bowl.

431
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:31,940
I'm going to put it in a bowl.

432
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,040
Oh, great!

433
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,900
I'm better at it, right?

434
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm getting used to it.

435
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,280
You like it, don't
you? Yes, I do.

436
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:45,040


437
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:52,180
You're so good at it, Binbin.

438
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,200
Wait, I have a lot too.

439
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:01,100
I have a bigger one.

440
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,260
It's important to wrap it up, but
there is also a direct technique.

441
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:18,250
It was delicious.

442
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:48,688
My husband and I have been living in this house for a long time

443
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:59,950
My husband and I decided to give
him a bath for the first time in a while.

444
01:19:59,951 --> 01:19:59,990
It's a bath that is not
a bath for cats, but

445
01:19:59,255 --> 01:20:13,170
I will give him a bath, but I am
afraid he will be too scared to go out.

446
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:14,171
It's me, isn't it?

447
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:23,390
It's me when you go, isn't it?

448
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:37,830
How do you feel?

449
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:01,590
It's me, isn't it?

450
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,090
You like Suzu, don't you?

451
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,100
You can't be together.

452
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,400
We're not together.

453
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,480
I'm so nervous.

454
01:21:31,565 --> 01:21:32,760
I want to go, but I can't.

455
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:33,761
I'm not going to stop.

456
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,380
Oh no, Chikubi is also feeling sick.

457
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,160
Are you sick, Chikubi?

458
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,460
Chikubi is weak.

459
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,920
Then I'll give you a lot to drink.

460
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,600
I can't help it.

461
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,050
I can't drink at all.

462
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,830
It's fun.

463
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,390
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

464
01:22:38,391 --> 01:22:39,471
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

465
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:44,070
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

466
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:47,730
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

467
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,870
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

468
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:52,330
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

469
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,650
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

470
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:54,250
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

471
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,410
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

472
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,270
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

473
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:01,770
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

474
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:06,030
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

475
01:23:06,031 --> 01:23:06,250
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

476
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:07,810
It's a bell, isn't
it? Yes, it is.

477
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,890


478
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:10,350
Which one is it?

479
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,670
Hurry up and decide.

480
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,090
You have to decide.

481
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:18,370
It's a bell, isn't
it? Yes, it is.

482
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:19,850


483
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:21,550
Which one is it?

484
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,706
I can't decide the first one.

485
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:27,870
What are you talking
about? I'm sorry.

486
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:28,871


487
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:34,790
You're so honest, but you're so hard on me.

488
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,850
You can't do that.

489
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:39,690
I won't let you go.

490
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:44,370
It's painful.

491
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,550
It's painful, isn't it?

492
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:47,810
You have to be patient.

493
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:50,550
I'm scared.

494
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,910
You can't do that.

495
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:19,050
Mom, I'm going to the bathroom.

496
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:20,051
I told you, didn't I?

497
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,930
Well, that's a bit of a
no-no, isn't it? Yeah.

498
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:24,670


499
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,910
Because you didn't decide.

500
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,970
After all, you don't usually change.

501
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:30,670
Which one? No, really.

502
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:32,270


503
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,530
Which one?

504
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,310
Which one?

505
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:45,080
I really can't believe it.

506
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,420
Make it clear.

507
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:48,300
I'm going to ask you the answer today.

508
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,280
Answer?

509
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,380
Which one is better? Make it clear.

510
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,120
Oh.

511
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,040
Which one?

512
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:55,720
Which one?

513
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,300
Which one?

514
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,360
Both Both?

515
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,160
Both?

516
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:00,960
Which one?

517
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,661
I don't know What do you mean?

518
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,020
Which one?

519
01:25:04,021 --> 01:25:04,540
I can't choose

520
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:05,690
What is this hand?

521
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,220
What?

522
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:07,980
What is this hand?

523
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:08,880
What is this hand?

524
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:09,340
Are you turning me down?

525
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,760
Hey, wait

526
01:25:11,495 --> 01:25:14,840
Make it clear which
one you want Hey, wait

527
01:25:16,365 --> 01:25:18,140
Hey, I can't do that

528
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,590
Which one do you
like? I don't know.

529
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,920
I don't know.

530
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:23,920
Both are good.

531
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,040
Both? Both.

532
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:25,580
I got it.

533
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,100


534
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,840


535
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,560
Then, think a little more.

536
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:36,800
Which do you like better,
left or right? Right, I guess.

537
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,120


538
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,100
Right?

539
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,360
You like me better.

540
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
That's right.

541
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,520
Oh!

542
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:58,020
Are you done?

543
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,000
No, I'm not done yet.

544
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,320
Yuji is the worst.

545
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,340
You're right.

546
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,320
Oh, no.

547
01:26:19,445 --> 01:26:20,726
Which one do you like
this time? I like both.

548
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,440


549
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:28,970
Which one do you
like? I like both.

550
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,500


551
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,680
Which one do you
like? I can't decide.

552
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:41,100
I like both.

553
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,020


554
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:44,650
You like both?

555
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,060
Yes.

556
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,680
Which one is better?

557
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:55,530
Which one is better? Look.

558
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,900
Don't run away.

559
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,020
It's not me.

560
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,120


561
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,840
The bell looks good on you.

562
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,560
Show me.

563
01:27:08,561 --> 01:27:09,561
Let me see.

564
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:15,240
Both of them are great.

565
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:16,580
Which one do you like?

566
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,280
This one is a little transparent.

567
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,600
The red one is cute.

568
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,900
Which one do you
like? Both of them.

569
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:25,660


570
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,500
Why? Both of them.

571
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:27,180
Let me see.

572
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,360


573
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,160
It's me, isn't it?

574
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,960
It's soft, isn't it?

575
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:34,040
It's big, isn't it? It's big.

576
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,160


577
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,340
Sensitivity is important.

578
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:41,060
Touch me more.

579
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:11,010
Do you love me, Aoi?

580
01:28:21,265 --> 01:28:25,980
Aoi, you didn't say anything until
now, but you liked to be bullied.

581
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,500
I'll give you a lot.

582
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,160
I'll give you a lot.

583
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,320
Ah...

584
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,930
Ah...

585
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:29,930
It feels good, doesn't it?

586
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,690
Which one feels
good? Both of them.

587
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:32,890


588
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:33,790
Which one is
better? Both of them.

589
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:34,710


590
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:35,490
Why?

591
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,030
Why? Both of them
are bad? No, no.

592
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:38,550
Which one?

593
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,010
Both of them felt good.

594
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,590
I thought so, too.

595
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:43,790
Don't run away.

596
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:45,030
Why are you running away?

597
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,250
Why are you running
away? No, no, no.

598
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:47,550
You're mean.

599
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:48,770
It's not fair.

600
01:29:48,771 --> 01:29:49,771
It's not fair.

601
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,810


602
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,230
My feather is the hardest, isn't it?

603
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,210
No, mine is better.

604
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:17,750
You like it, don't
you? No, I don't.

605
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:19,571
But it's so soft.

606
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:20,650
It feels good.

607
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:21,570
No, you don't.

608
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:22,870
No, I don't.

609
01:30:23,365 --> 01:30:24,170
No, I don't.

610
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:25,090
No, I don't.

611
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:26,091
No, I don't.

612
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,810
No, I don't.

613
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:28,510
No, I don't.

614
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:29,511
No, I don't.

615
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:30,590
No, I don't.

616
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,630
No, I don't.

617
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,050
No, I don't.

618
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:34,530
No, I don't.

619
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,670
No, I don't.

620
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:37,030
No, I don't.

621
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:37,050
No, I don't.

622
01:30:37,051 --> 01:30:37,130
No, I don't.

623
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:40,870
No, I don't.

624
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:42,510
No, I don't.

625
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:47,170
No, I don't.

626
01:30:51,455 --> 01:30:58,670
I love both of them.

627
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:00,450
Do you love both of them?

628
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,530
Which one do you like?

629
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,320
Let me feel good.

630
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:10,310
If you like both of them, let me feel good.

631
01:31:10,311 --> 01:31:11,311
Touch it and decide.

632
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,160
Touch it properly.

633
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,080
It's still 40g.

634
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,940
Let me feel good.

635
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,700
It's not enough.

636
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,200
More.

637
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:38,460
Which one do you like?
Touch it and make me feel good.

638
01:31:38,461 --> 01:31:39,461
Let me kiss you.

639
01:31:46,765 --> 01:31:47,765
Which one do you like?

640
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,900
Well, both of them.

641
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,520
Why?

642
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,060
Both of them are lovely.

643
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,660
Lovely?

644
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:55,460
Which one?

645
01:31:55,461 --> 01:31:55,640
Which one?

646
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,200
What?

647
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,740
Well, Suzu and I are lovely, too.

648
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:06,720
If you say you like both of them,
I have to make you feel good.

649
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:08,900
Take responsibility.

650
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,320
What?

651
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:12,740
You don't like it?

652
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:14,620
If you don't like it, I'm going to sleep.

653
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,060
Good night.

654
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,440
I don't care anymore.

655
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:39,960
Both of you are very wet.

656
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:06,050
Thank you.

657
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:21,740
It's sweet.

658
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:33,540
Are you satisfied? Why? Not yet.

659
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:36,880


660
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,600
How can I be satisfied?

661
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:43,040
You haven't touched my boobs yet.

662
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:43,840
Boobs? Look.

663
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,340
Look.

664
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,320


665
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:52,080
Which one do you like more?

666
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:56,420
This one or this one.

667
01:33:56,421 --> 01:33:56,960
Both.

668
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:57,560
Both?

669
01:33:57,970 --> 01:33:58,970
Idiot!

670
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,720
Why don't you decide
properly? Do it harder.

671
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:03,310


672
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,300
It's not that easy.

673
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:28,580
Do you like the bigger one?

674
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,181
You've been grooming only Suzu.

675
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,740
You have a lot of energy.

676
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,340
This is why men...

677
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,680
Touch it properly.

678
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,260
I love the way you lick my boobs.

679
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,460
Please lick my boobs too.

680
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:27,610
I feel good.

681
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,540
You are satisfied with this.

682
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,540
No, I'm not.

683
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:55,691
What are you satisfied with?

684
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,180
What is this hand?

685
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,960
What are you satisfied with?

686
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:03,631
I think you both feel good enough.

687
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:09,460
If we don't feel good
together, it doesn't make sense.

688
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:12,270
Do you like both?

689
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:14,840
Do you like both?

690
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:15,841
Do you feel good?

691
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,220
Both of you are standing.

692
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,960
Oh, my legs.

693
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,920
Do this.

694
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,660
What is it?

695
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,140
It's a joint work, isn't it?

696
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:31,120
Wait, what is a joint work?

697
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:32,955
It's the first time to do a joint work.

698
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,480
It's the first time, isn't it?

699
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,180
Next, make me feel good.

700
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:40,720
It's not fair.

701
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,800
I did a joint work, so look at me.

702
01:37:45,465 --> 01:38:09,630
I have a new cat.

703
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,180
This is my first time to use the cat room.

704
01:38:23,181 --> 01:38:23,200
I'm glad there is a big cat here.

705
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:26,380
There are many cats here.

706
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:31,700
I thought they would be
small, but they are not.

707
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,440
You are so kind.

708
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:42,311
I don't want to take a rest either.

709
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:45,810
But you like both, don't you?

710
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:48,050
I take responsibility for both.

711
01:38:59,040 --> 01:40:18,740
I want more.

712
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,500
It's hard.

713
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,820
Which one do you
like better? I like both.

714
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,520


715
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:34,320
Both?

716
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,500
Which one?

717
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,520
How about my horse? It was good.

718
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,400


719
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,360
How was it? It was good.

720
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,480


721
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,320
It's mine, isn't it?

722
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,880
No, no, I like your horse better.

723
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:50,240
How was it?

724
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,800
How?

725
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:54,340
Why are you so indecisive?

726
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:13,460
My ferret is the best, isn't it?

727
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,820
No, mine is better.

728
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,680
Your mother was also pulling it.

729
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:22,720
It's hot.

730
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:28,360
I feel good, too.

731
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:30,840
Which side do you
feel good? It's hot.

732
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,240


733
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,620
You are trembling.

734
01:41:41,305 --> 01:41:42,220
Which side do you feel good?

735
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:43,221
Are you okay? Here you are.

736
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,720
Touch here.

737
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,800
Oh, my.

738
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:52,540


739
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:02,160
It feels so good.

740
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,320
I want to do it more.

741
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,340
It's hot.

742
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,560
Is it hot? Touch me.

743
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:19,840
Aoi-kun.

744
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,400
It's not fair.

745
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,260


746
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,340
It's OK, isn't
it? It's not fair.

747
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,200


748
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:33,940
Make yourself comfortable.

749
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:38,110
I'm going to put it in.

750
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,200
It's my turn next.

751
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,520
Oh, it's cold.

752
01:42:55,410 --> 01:42:59,640
Don't just scratch me.
Scratch this side, too.

753
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:04,160
It feels good, doesn't it?

754
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:10,000
How do you feel? It feels good.

755
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,420


756
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,880
How do you feel?

757
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:20,540
Mele-chan, it's my turn.

758
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,400
Wait 10 seconds.

759
01:43:23,401 --> 01:43:39,160
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

760
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:40,810
Did you eat well? Yes, I did.

761
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:42,420
I'm full.

762
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:44,630


763
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:47,380
It's my turn next.

764
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:52,591
Make yourself comfortable.

765
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:58,320
Look at me.

766
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,040
Can you see me? Yes, I can.

767
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:02,040
Smile.

768
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,420


769
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:15,940
I'm glad you're all right.

770
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,820
Don't put your hands on my eyes.

771
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:28,220
You like my pussy, right?

772
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:29,720
Which one?

773
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:32,800
You still don't
understand? I'm sorry.

774
01:44:32,801 --> 01:44:33,801


775
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,380
Don't make a mess.

776
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,640
It's time to go, isn't it?

777
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:21,580
It's not over yet.

778
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:23,840
I can't let Aoi go.

779
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:31,860
Let me go.

780
01:45:38,275 --> 01:45:41,060
Aoi, are you comfortable?

781
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,080
You shouldn't go out.

782
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:50,580
I'm ready to go out anytime.

783
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:57,700
I'm getting warmer, Aoi.

784
01:46:58,475 --> 01:47:00,120
This baby is the first child of the family
who were born in the same hospital.

785
01:47:00,121 --> 01:47:02,756
This baby is the first child of the family
who were born in the same hospital.

786
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,420
The first child is a girl in the family.

787
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,900
I'm going to give you a pacifier.

788
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:15,060
Does it feel good?

789
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:26,440
Do you want me to touch
your neck? I feel tired.

790
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,590
..

791
01:47:39,591 --> 01:47:40,591
boo-boo, you're scared.

792
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,000
Attack from behind.

793
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:05,340
From the back.

794
01:48:11,745 --> 01:48:13,520
From the back.

795
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,480
From the back.

796
01:48:21,610 --> 01:48:23,700
I feel sick.

797
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,380
I feel sick.

798
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:30,670
I feel sick.

799
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,900
I don't want to.

800
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:20,720
I don't have time to rest.

801
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:19,887
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying in front of

802
01:50:19,899 --> 01:50:25,950
me, and I'm so happy that I
can't help but cry when I see him.

803
01:50:25,970 --> 01:51:14,260
I'm so happy that I can't
help but cry when I see him.

804
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,340
This way? It's too early.

805
01:51:17,225 --> 01:51:19,060


806
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:25,780
Do you feel good? It's hard.

807
01:51:33,530 --> 01:52:23,530
It's hard.

808
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:28,250
Yabai.

809
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,180


810
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:33,350
Let's kiss a lot.

811
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:46,220
Do you like me? Yes, I do.

812
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:48,260


813
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:49,540
I like you, too.

814
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:52,680
Yabai, don't make me wait.

815
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:58,420
Do you like me, too? I love you.

816
01:52:58,421 --> 01:52:59,421


817
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:02,400
I love you, too.

818
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:13,020
I love you.

819
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,780
I love you.

820
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:40,880
I love you, too.

821
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,180
I love you.

822
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:49,660
I love you.

823
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,080
I love you.

824
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:58,380
Oh, it feels good.

825
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:01,920
I love you so much that I'm going to cry.

826
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,380
I'm going to cry.

827
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:06,580
I'm going to cry.

828
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:17,880
I'm going to cry.

829
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:23,680
I'm going to cry.

830
01:54:23,681 --> 01:54:24,681
I'm going to cry.

831
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:26,520
Don't cry.

832
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,660
Let me out.

833
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:35,890
Wow! A lot.

834
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,750


835
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:57,260
You can still get out, can't you?

836
01:54:57,730 --> 01:54:58,730
I put her inside.

837
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:00,140
What should I do? She got out.

838
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:00,960


839
01:55:01,110 --> 01:55:02,760
I'll take care of you.

840
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:06,060
I said I'll take care of you
and make you feel good.

841
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,540
Then, I'll take care of you, too.

842
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:11,860
You can still go out.

843
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:20,820
You're still a baby.

844
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,380
You just gave birth, so you
can't stand up right away.

845
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,000
But you're still a baby.

846
01:55:31,235 --> 01:55:33,640
A little while after birth, I
decided to take care of her.

847
01:55:33,641 --> 01:55:34,641
I'm sorry.

848
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,080
You're so cute.

849
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:10,960
You're so cute that I'm
going to leave you soon.

850
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:26,560
Give me a lot of candy.

851
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:56,450
Give me all of it.

852
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:16,150
Wow! There are so many!

853
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:17,330
Wow!

854
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:23,660
Is this your first time?

855
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:27,690
There are so many.

856
01:57:32,270 --> 01:57:35,900
Aoi, you are responsible for
having two kids, aren't you?

857
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,576
You are responsible for them, aren't you?

858
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:42,680
You made friends with them.

859
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,220
Let's live with three of us.

860
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,600
I did it!

861
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,820
I'm the winner!

862
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,840
You've become a man.
