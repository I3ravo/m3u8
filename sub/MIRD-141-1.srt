00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000

There are 16 people to be introduced, but

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you do something that the actress dislikes and are watched by the staff or the director,

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
you will be replaced as a back-boxer.

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
In any case, please follow the rules and get along with each other.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This time, there is a ninja in the back of the bus, so there is a spy.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The bad guys will go on a trip to training.

Let's start introducing ourselves.

133
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's start with the first one.

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm Hata-chan.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Nice to meet you.

I'm a girl today, so I'm the first one to be stolen today.

139
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Hata-chan, how many people do you have in total?

141
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,760
Of course I have 0 people in total.

142
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,260
What are the three points?

143
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,760
The three points are beautiful skin and this high nose.

144
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
High nose?

145
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,260
Then from the side.

146
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Everyone says it's straight, but it's not straight.

147
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Really?

148
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Look, look.

149
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
Really?

150
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Really?

151
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
I didn't.

152
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Then there is no difference.

153
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Yes.

154
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
Then.

155
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Is it okay?

156
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
It's okay.

157
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
It's pretty fast.

158
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
What are the charms of your skin, Hata-chan?

159
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
It's pretty.

160
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
What are the other things?

161
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,660
I have a deep skin, and I have a beautiful入.

162
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,340
You have a beautiful入.

163
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Yes!

164
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,340
You should have seen it.

165
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
You should have searched the internet.

166
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
No, I shouldn't have.

167
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Just search it later.

168
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
What is it?

169
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Is it a beauty?

170
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
What is it?

171
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
I don't know.

172
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
What is it?

173
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
It's a beauty.

174
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
What is it?

175
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
It's a beauty.

176
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Do you have a beauty?

177
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Let's take a look.

178
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,340
How much is it?

179
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,340
Please tell me the number.

180
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
From the middle.

181
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
From the middle?

182
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
59 from the middle.

183
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,340
88 from the middle.

184
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
89 from the bottom.

185
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
What's your point?

186
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Your beautiful skin.

187
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,340
Don't ask me that.

188
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,340
Please give it to me.

189
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,340
When you were a kid, you must have been happy with boys.

190
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
Do you have a point?

191
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
You were drooling, but you were Lucy.

192
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Yes, I am Lucy.

193
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,340
So, what is your name?

194
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
I'm Takkun.

195
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Takkun.

196
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,340
Thank you.

197
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Is it good?

198
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,340
It's the 10th one.

199
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
Please eat it.

200
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Thank you.

201
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,340
It's delicious.

202
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
It's delicious.

203
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
It's delicious.

204
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
It's delicious.

205
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,340
It's delicious.

206
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,340
You have 10 seconds left.

207
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
4

208
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
5

209
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
4

210
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
3

211
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
2

212
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,340
1

213
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Go!

214
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
It was a good start.

215
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Yes, it was.

216
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
But it was so close.

217
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
Yes.

218
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,340
Look.

219
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
What was your third point?

220
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,340
The down points are beautiful flowers and...

221
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Thank you very much!

222
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Thank you very much!

223
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
Let's move on to the second place.

224
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
Please tell us your name.

225
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
My name is Ichika Kamihata.

226
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
Call me Ichi.

227
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,340
It's a pretty difficult word.

228
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Look at this.

229
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
Kamihata.

230
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
They say you can't read it.

231
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I'll look it up later.

232
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
It's okay.

233
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
Let's go.

234
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Please tell us your name.

235
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
My name is Takapon.

236
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Takapon?

237
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Thank you very much. Let's get started.

238
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Let's start from the pedagogy course.

239
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Please tell me the size.

240
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
Please tell me the size.

241
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,340
The foot size is 83 from the top.

242
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
60.

243
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
84.

244
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,340
Long tongue.

245
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,340
Long tongue.

246
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
It's really long.

247
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,340
What about the skin? Is it beautiful?

248
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
The skin is white.

249
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
It's white.

250
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,340
What's your hobby?

251
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
My hobby is cooking.

252
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
What are you good at?

253
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm good at paella.

254
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
I tried it recently, but it didn't go well.

255
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
That's right.

256
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
Chocolate cake.

257
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,340
It's difficult.

258
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
I'm the best in Heian.

259
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
What's the average number of people?

260
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
The average number of people is...

261
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Six people.

262
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
Six people?

263
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
There's no reason to do that.

264
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
There's a lot.

265
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
It's getting bigger.

266
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
It's getting bigger.

267
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
It's good if you put it out.

268
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
It's good if you put it out.

269
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
Oh, it's big.

270
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
What should we do, everyone?

271
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
If you put it out now, it's a waste.

272
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
You shouldn't think about that.

273
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
I'm glad.

274
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
I'm glad.

275
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
It's like mochi rice, isn't it?

276
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
It's very juicy.

277
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
It's very crispy.

278
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
It's 10 seconds, right?

279
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
10 seconds?

280
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:25,340
3...2...1...

281
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
It's over. What a shame.

282
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
What a shame.

283
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
Was it fun?

284
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
It was fun.

285
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
It was fun.

286
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
I'm embarrassed.

287
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
What is this?

288
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Thank you very much.

289
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,560
That's it. Thank you very much.

290
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Let's move on to the third question.

291
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Please introduce yourself.

292
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
My name is Oto Hananose.

293
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Thank you very much.

294
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,360
I heard that you wanted to show your chest in an interview.

295
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
What should I do?

296
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,560
Are you confident?

297
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
No, I'm not.

298
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Cheers!

299
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Cheers!

300
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Cheers!

301
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Cheers!

302
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Cheers!

303
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Cheers!

304
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Cheers!

305
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
New version.

306
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Is this okay?

307
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
That's not it.

308
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
What is it?

309
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,560
You're not satisfied with this, are you?

310
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Can I take it out?

311
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Please.

312
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Don't look at me.

313
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Can you touch it?

315
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Can you touch it?

316
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Information.

317
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
What?

318
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
What is the size of the three?

319
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
The three sizes are

320
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
from the top,

321
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
83, 56,

322
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
83.

323
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
How do you touch it?

324
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
It's crazy.

325
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Can you introduce yourself?

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
My name is Yu.

327
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Now, please introduce yourself.

328
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Please start.

329
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Thank you.

330
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
You look like you just got out of the shower.

331
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
You look like you just got out of the shower.

332
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Now, please.

333
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Okay.

334
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,560
You look like you just got out of the shower.

335
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
You look like you just got out of the shower.

336
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
I'm not good at it.

337
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Are you a member of the Seikantai?

338
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Are you talking about me?

339
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
I'm a member of the Seikantai.

340
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm Uchimomo.

341
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
It's a rare place, isn't it?

342
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Isn't that the best place?

343
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
The best place is Kuri.

344
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Of course, I'm a big fan of you.

345
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Do you like to be licked?

346
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I like to be licked.

347
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
I see.

348
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Do you have any experience?

349
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Experience?

350
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Yes.

351
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
About three people.

352
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I don't want to be licked.

353
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Do you have any experience?

354
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Most of the time.

355
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Thank you very much.

356
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
How about you, Asafela?

357
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Asafela, thank you very much.

358
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Thank you very much.

359
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Don't look at me.

360
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Don't look at me.

361
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Don't look at me.

362
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Number 4, please.

363
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm Yuki Natsume.

364
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Thank you very much.

365
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
What's your charm point?

366
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Charm point?

367
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm a great hitter.

368
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
It's not like that.

369
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
When I sleep, I usually show my front teeth.

370
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Isn't your butt a charm point?

371
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
What?

372
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Your butt.

373
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
My butt? My butt is a charm point.

374
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Like your gums?

375
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
My gums are a charm point.

376
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Then show me.

377
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Now?

378
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Now?

379
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Can I do it now?

380
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
You can do it now.

381
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,560
It's getting harder and harder.

382
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
It's not like that.

383
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I can't see it well.

384
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I can't see it.

385
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Which one is it?

386
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
See?

387
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Wait a minute.

388
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Wait a minute.

389
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I can brag about this.

390
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
It's a good way to wear it.

391
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm a heart-shaped manga.

392
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
That's right.

393
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,560
It's a good way to subscribe to the world.

394
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
That's right.

395
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Let's start the self-introduction of the main character.

396
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Yes, please.

397
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
That's why I kicked Rui.

398
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Who are you?

399
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm Hiro.

400
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Hiro-san.

401
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Nice to meet you.

402
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Please start.

403
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Neck, back, chest, and...

404
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I like mangos the most.

405
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
What's your hobby?

406
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
My hobby is to go for a walk with my lover.

407
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
What kind of dog do you have?

408
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
I have Pomeranian.

409
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Do you like Pomeranian?

410
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I want to eat too!

411
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Did you force yourself to eat?

412
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm a boy after all.

413
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Did you force yourself to eat?

414
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
It's better to have a golden egg.

415
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
I see.

416
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
You can do it if you're lucky.

417
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
That's right.

418
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
You won't stop, right?

419
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
It's hot.

420
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
10 seconds left.

421
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
2, 1.

422
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Too bad.

423
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
It's a pity.

424
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
Thank you very much.

427
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Please introduce yourself.

428
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm Riku Minato.

429
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Nice to meet you.

430
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Can I tell you the size of the foot?

431
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
The foot size is

432
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
from the top

433
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
105

434
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
58

435
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
90

436
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Is it 105?

437
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Is it okay?

438
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
It's okay.

439
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Listen to me.

440
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Is it okay?

441
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
It's okay, but it's small.

442
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
I want to lick it later.

443
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
How is it?

444
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
It's pretty.

445
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Wow.

446
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
How is it?

447
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
105 cm.

448
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
105 cm, how is it?

449
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
It's heavy, isn't it?

450
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
It's heavy.

451
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Please don't pull 105 cm.

452
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Who are you?

453
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
I'm Yoshi.

454
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I'm Yoshi.

455
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Yes.

456
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Let's wrap it up.

457
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Please introduce yourself.

458
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,560
It's like a pervert.

459
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,560
It's a pervert.

460
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
It's okay to write like this.

462
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Please take it out.

463
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
It's a pervert.

464
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm laughing.

465
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Please take it out.

466
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
It's soundproofing.

467
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,560
It's dangerous.

468
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Amazing.

469
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Where is the seikan-tai?

470
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Me?

471
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
The seikan-tai is a wakimara.

472
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Wakimara?

473
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Try to answer.

474
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
I can't answer.

475
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
How?

476
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Kindly.

477
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
What do you think about Pisa?

478
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
What do you think about Pisa?

479
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Pisa is...

480
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,560
I like to be gently touched.

481
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
I see.

482
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Do you have any experience?

483
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
To be honest.

484
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
About...

485
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
How much is your part-time job?

486
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
It's about two digits.

487
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
So it's about 95 people.

488
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,560
If it's just a transit, it's one digit.

489
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
One digit?

490
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Yes.

491
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,840
You took it the other way around.

492
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
The other way around?

493
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
You didn't take it too far.

494
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I thought it was that.

495
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
You thought it was that.

496
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
You thought it was that.

497
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,840
What do you mean by that?

498
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Now, don't stop.

499
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
In the direction of the launch.

500
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
It's okay.

501
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Look up.

502
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Look up.

503
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Look at yourself.

504
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
20 seconds before.

505
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Thank you very much.

506
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Thank you very much.

507
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
It's cold, isn't it?

508
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Thank you very much.

509
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Hello, I'm Hamasaki Mao.

510
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Nice to meet you.

511
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
I'm Hamasaki Mao.

512
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Nice to meet you.

513
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
What are the three points?

514
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
What?

515
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Three?

516
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I only thought about one.

517
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Where is the first one?

518
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
I want to see the Nyu-Rin.

519
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Nyu-Rin? I want to see it.

520
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Nyu-Rin.

521
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
It's Nyu-Rin, not Chikumi.

522
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Please show us Nyu-Rin as Chikumi.

523
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Nyu-Rin! Nyu-Rin! Nyu-Rin! Nyu-Rin! Nyu-Rin! Nyu-Rin!

524
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Great!

525
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Please go back to the circle.

526
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
3cm!

527
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Hurry up!

528
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
3cm!

529
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
This time, it's neck and ear.

530
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Thank you very much.

531
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Let's go again!

532
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Please!

533
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Please!

534
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,840
You don't have much experience, do you?

535
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
No.

536
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
You don't have much experience, do you?

537
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
I remember it from the 3rd episode.

538
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,840
The 3rd episode?

539
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,840
565 people?

540
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,840
Why are you crying?

541
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,440
I don't remember Shimabukuro-san,

542
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,440
but once I was teased by Shimabukuro-san,

543
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,240
and now I'm scared.

544
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
What is your favorite movie?

545
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,240
If you do that, you will cry.

546
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
When Mr. Chimabukuro gets angry.

547
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
What is your favorite food?

548
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,240
What is your favorite food?

549
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Japanese food? Italian food? Chinese food?

550
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
My favorite food is...

551
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,340
It's a banana.

552
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,340
It's cute, isn't it?

553
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,680
It's a little banana.

554
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Don't you get angry today?

555
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,440
I don't get angry.

556
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Do you have a favorite TV program?

557
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,360
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

558
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,680
It was a pity.

559
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Thank you very much.

560
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,920
Who was it?

561
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,240
It was SHINYA.

562
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Thank you very much.

563
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Please introduce yourself.

564
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
My name is Maya.

565
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
You have 3 points.

566
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
3 points?

567
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Please smile.

568
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I understand.

569
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Start.

570
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
I'll show you.

571
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Everyone wants to see Kamuro-san's boobs.

572
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Please look at it.

573
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
If you can see it, give her a round of applause.

574
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
If you can see it, give her a round of applause.

575
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Please look at it.

576
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Look at the gold and look at it from the side.

577
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
It's very beautiful.

578
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Please introduce yourself.

579
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
My name is Tanaka.

580
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Can I touch you?

581
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Yes, please.

582
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Strong or weak?

583
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Strong.

584
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
This is good.

585
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,240
I don't need an explanation.

586
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Let's get started.

587
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Please introduce yourself.

588
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Please start.

589
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,240
I will eat.

590
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Can I ask you a question?

591
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,240
My name is Chikubi.

592
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
What's next?

593
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Hmm...

594
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
And...

595
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Hmm...

596
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
And...

597
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
The neckline...

598
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
The neckline is quite different, isn't it?

599
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
I can't stop it!

600
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's check the image.

601
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
What's your favorite attitude?

602
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Hmm...

603
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I like the back.

604
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
The back, huh?

605
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Yes.

606
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,240
I think you did it in a strange place today.

607
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,240
The emergency staircase of a crowded building.

608
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
It's a crime.

609
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Is that so?

610
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Is it a crime?

611
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
It's a crime officially.

612
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Is that so?

613
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Yes.

614
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
But you were seen by someone, right?

615
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
It's a crime.

616
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
It's official.

617
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,100
You like Doki Doki, don't you?

618
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Yeah.

619
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,040
What's your favorite masterpiece?

620
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,540
Hmm?

621
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,840
What's your favorite masterpiece?

622
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
My favorite masterpiece?

623
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Please look at this.

624
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Well...

625
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Well...

626
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,740
All of them are good, but...

627
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,540
Especially?

628
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,740
Especially...

629
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
Well...

630
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,740
Youth School Memories.

631
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,140
Youth School Memories.

632
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,140
I'm a high school girl, Mono. Nice to meet you.

633
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
I'll try to look at it with DMM.

634
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,140
Please.

635
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
Just look at it.

636
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,140
It's already 10 seconds before that.

637
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:50,140
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

638
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,140
What is it?

639
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
What is it?

640
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,140
It's a school memory of the players.

641
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
I will definitely see it.

642
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Thank you very much.

643
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Please introduce yourself.

644
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,140
I'm Maki Hara Mada.

645
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Please tell me about three points.

646
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Three? I could only think of one.

647
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
Tell me one.

648
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:27,140
I have two big front teeth like a rat.

649
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Two big front teeth?

650
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Two big front teeth.

651
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Aren't you running away a little?

652
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,140
I'm having fun.

653
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,140
It's true that you have big front teeth.

654
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,140
I'll give you three sizes.

655
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Three sizes.

656
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:53,140
My free size is 83.

657
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,140
My waist size is 58.

658
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,140
I don't have a lot of hips, but...

659
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:11,140
It's hard to take off your clothes again today, isn't it?

660
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:17,140
If you don't touch it, you have to touch it.

661
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Who is it?

662
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
It's Shin-san.

663
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
Touch it.

664
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
You auditioned, didn't you?

665
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Yes.

666
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
I'm the same age as you.

667
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
How old are you now?

668
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
I'm 27 years old.

669
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,140
Why are you still 27 years old?

670
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
I didn't have a circle.

671
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Maybe you don't have a circle this time.

672
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
No, no, no, this time I have a circle.

673
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Let's start.

674
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
You are a virgin, aren't you?

675
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
Yes.

676
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
Amazing?

677
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,140
I can see my buttocks.

678
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Amazing. Please come out.

679
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
What did you say?

680
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Do your best!

681
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Everyone is watching.

682
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
What is your life style?

683
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
My life style is...

684
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Clitoris.

685
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Clitoris?

686
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
You have more, right?

687
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
You have more, right?

688
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
Where?

689
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,140
Back.

690
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
You have it, don't you?

691
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,140
My toes.

692
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
You have it, don't you?

693
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
What's the hole?

694
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
What's the hole?

695
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
I'm so sensitive.

696
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
What's the hole?

697
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
The hole.

698
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
What's the hole, Takki?

699
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
This much.

700
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,140
I wonder if it will be Makihara-san.

701
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,140
I think I will never forget about Makihara-san.

702
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Makihara-san.

703
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
I will never forget about her.

704
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,140
She is a liar.

705
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
I will never forget about her.

706
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
I will never forget about her.

707
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
I will never forget about her.

708
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
I will remember her a lot.

709
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,140
I will remember her for 20 years.

710
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
How do you feel?

711
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm so happy.

712
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I'm so happy.

713
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,140
I will never forget this moment.

714
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,140
I can't think of any other time.

715
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,140
I'm sorry I was noisy.

716
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,140
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

717
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,140
I'll take a photo of you later.

718
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,140
Please introduce yourself.

719
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
I'm Ayu Sakurai.

720
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Please introduce yourself.

721
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,140
I'm Chippai.

722
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
What is Chippai?

723
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,140
It's the sound of a cup.

724
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,140
It's possible to show it.

725
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
It's possible now.

726
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Please say it's possible.

727
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
What should I do if I get caught?

728
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,140
What are you talking about?

729
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Fail.

730
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
Look at it properly.

731
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Look at it.

732
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,140
It's small.

733
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
We're the small ones.

734
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,140
What should we do?

735
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
You can't do it, right?

736
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
You want to do it, right?

737
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
You want to do it, right?

738
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I want to do it.

739
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
I'm going to do it.

740
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
You can't do it, right?

741
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
You can't do it, right?

742
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
You can do it, you can do it.

743
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
You can do it.

744
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
You're used to it?

745
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
No.

746
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Is it better?

747
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,440
I can hold the red one.

748
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm shy.

749
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Let's do it.

750
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Let's do it.

751
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Please introduce yourself.

752
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Nice to meet you.

753
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Who are you?

754
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
I'm Ichi.

755
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Ichi?

756
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Yes.

757
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Nice to meet you.

758
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

760
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

761
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

762
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Who? Ayu?

763
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Yes.

764
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Ayu Ayu.

765
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Ayu Ayu.

766
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
The third one.

767
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
The third one.

768
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
The third one?

769
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Yes.

770
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
The back of my legs.

771
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
The back of your legs.

772
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Yes.

773
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Oh.

774
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
You don't usually do Ayu Ayu, do you?

775
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
It feels good when you lick it.

776
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
It's not a massage.

777
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Yes.

778
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It feels good when you lick it.

779
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
This is the second one.

780
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Hmm...

781
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
The one with the feet?

782
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
The one with the feet!

783
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Is this called the one with the feet?

784
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Yes, it is.

785
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
The one with the feet?

786
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Yes.

787
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
You can lick it or touch it.

788
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
That's not it.

789
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
The first one!

790
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Clitoris.

791
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Yay!

792
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Clitoris is delicious, isn't it?

793
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
I love clitoris.

794
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
I see.

795
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
How many did you get?

796
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,440
How many videos do you have?

797
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,440
I have about 200 videos.

798
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Wow, you have 200 videos?

799
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,440
You are saving money with DMM, aren't you?

800
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Yes, I am.

801
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Can I see it?

802
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Yes, you can.

803
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,440
DMM is very cheap.

804
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Moody's is also in the EMM group.

805
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
It went in, didn't it?

806
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Is it going to come out?

807
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
If it comes out, raise your hand a little.

808
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
If it comes out, you can feel it.

809
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I'll wait.

810
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Oh, good.

811
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
It's difficult.

812
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
It's difficult.

813
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
I don't like it.

814
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
The picture has power.

815
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
I can't do it.

816
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I can't do it.

817
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
As expected of the expert.

818
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
I don't know.

819
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
I can do it somehow.

820
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,200
More.

821
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,200
First try.

822
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,560
Can you do this?

823
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,660
She became strong.

824
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,460
But when Ayo changed her movement,

825
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,340
when she became a little stiffer,

826
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,540
I thought it was impossible for her to do her best.

827
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,980
That's why I wanted to do my best.

828
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,980
Thank you very much.

829
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
Thank you very much.

830
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,220
No.10, please introduce yourself.

831
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,020
No.10, Abe no Miku. I made a mistake in kanji.

832
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
The staff made a mistake, didn't they?

833
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,020
Yes, and I made a mistake, too.

834
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,020
That's no good.

835
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,020
The result is no good.

836
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,020
Is this Abe no Miku?

837
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,020
Yes, it's Abe no Miku.

838
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,020
It's written with Abe no Miku, isn't it?

839
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,020
Yes, that's right.

840
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,020
It's written with that.

841
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,020
It's easy to remember.

842
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,020
You're familiar with cell phones, aren't you?

843
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Cell phones and tablets.

844
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,020
I don't know much about tablets.

845
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,020
I don't know anything.

846
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,020
Kawase Soba

847
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,020
You know it

848
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,020
Here it is

849
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
You are a genius

850
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
Where is the charm point?

851
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
The charm point is

852
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
Long eyelashes and

853
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,020
Buttocks

854
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,020
It looks like

855
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,020
From the buttocks

856
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
I want to see

857
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,020
I want to see

858
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
Please

859
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Here?

860
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,020
I don't know if I should say it or not

861
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,020
What should I change?

862
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,020
What should I do next?

863
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,020
I think you'll understand if you watch the news in the morning

864
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
You're so random

865
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Everyone is watching the news

866
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
I'm watching

867
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,020
I only watched it once in the last 3 weeks

868
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,020
Okay, okay, butt

869
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,020
Okay, everyone, let's do it

870
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,020
My butt

871
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
Your first butt

872
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
I'm at the limit of my seat belt

873
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,020
Please do it before

874
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,020
Before?

875
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,020
Please help me, it's not the time to say thank you.

876
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
You did something like thank you.

877
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,020
Camera-san, do your best.

878
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,020
Do my best?

879
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
Please open your legs a little.

880
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,020
It's embarrassing to be seen from the front.

881
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,020
Everyone is watching.

882
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,020
Let me move your hand.

883
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
It's hard.

884
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
Can you see it?

885
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,020
It's a good mosaic.

886
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,020
It's a digital mosaic.

887
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
How is Japan going to be?

888
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,020
From now on, let's do our best.

889
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Let's do it!

890
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
Start!

891
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
It didn't work.

892
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,020
It can't be helped.

893
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,020
Wait a minute.

894
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,020
I'll lick it.

895
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,020
I'm holding back a lot.

896
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
What's your name?

897
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,020
It's Saki.

898
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,020
Saki?

899
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
I saw a girl just now.

900
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,020
What do you like about the police?

901
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,020
What do you like about the police?

902
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
Whose?

903
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
Whose?

904
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,020
Abe's?

905
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
Yes, Abe's Mix.

906
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I'm a big fan of Abe's.

907
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
Recently, Chikubi is coming.

908
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,020
Chikubi is coming?

909
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,020
Recently, Chikubi is coming.

910
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,020
Chikubi is coming?

911
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,020
Yes.

912
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,020
On the contrary, it's a big one with a large down width.

913
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,020
I don't think so.

914
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
Down width?

915
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,020
I think it's easier to say.

916
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,020
Ear?

917
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,020
The ear is a little...

918
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,020
Is that so?

919
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,020
Ah! Ah! Ah!

920
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,020
Ah! Ah! Ah!

921
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,020
What are you doing?

922
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,020
That face!

923
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,020
The neck is twisted.

924
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,020
Ah! No! No!

925
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,020
Oh no! Oh no!

926
00:47:48,020 --> 00:48:00,020
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

927
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,020
It's a pity that I stuck a little

928
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,020
It's a pity

929
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,020
It was very comfortable

930
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,020
Do you want to take a look?

931
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,020
What?

932
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,020
Do you want to take a look?

933
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,020
I think it's easy to show

934
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,020
Please

935
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,020
From the bottom?

936
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,020
Why is it almost like that?

937
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,020
Say something

938
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,020
Say something

939
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,020
No comment

940
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,020
I can't see

941
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,020
That's good

942
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,020
Thank you very much

943
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,020
I can't do it anymore

944
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,020
Are you number 11?

945
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,020
Yes, I'm number 11.

946
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
Nice to meet you.

947
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
I'm Megumi Ishino.

948
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,020
You're so cute.

949
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,020
You're so cute.

950
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
Can you tell us your charm points?

951
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,020
Charm points...

952
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,020
If you can, tell us about 20.

953
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,020
That's a lot.

954
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
Well...

955
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Lately, I've been told that I have a nosebleed.

956
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,020
I see.

957
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,020
Lately, I've been told that I have a nosebleed.

958
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,020
Lately, I've been told that I have a nosebleed.

959
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,020
Not from the beginning.

960
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,020
It's been said a lot lately.

961
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,020
Show me.

962
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,020
It's beautiful.

963
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,020
Also,

964
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,020
it's been said a lot lately.

965
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,020
It's been said a lot lately.

966
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,020
It's broken.

967
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,020
It's a little broken.

968
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,020
Show me.

969
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,020
It's like this.

970
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,020
Wait a minute.

971
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,020
I'm wearing stockings today, so it's easy.

972
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,020
I don't know.

973
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,020
What's that?

974
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,020
Can I touch it?

975
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,020
Can I touch it?

976
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,020
Can I touch it?

977
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
It's hard.

978
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,020
It's hot.

979
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,020
It's hot.

980
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,020
It's very hot.

981
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,020
It's very hot.

982
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,020
I can see it.

983
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,020
I can see it.

984
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
What is that?

985
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,020
What is that?

986
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
Is it a breast?

987
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Is it a breast?

988
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,020
Let's start from there.

989
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,020
Let's go to the new rim.

990
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,020
I'm looking at it.

991
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,020
I'm looking at it.

992
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,020
I'm looking at it.

993
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,020
I'm embarrassed.

994
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,020
This is a picture.

995
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,020
What is the three size?

996
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,020
The three size is 80 from the top.

997
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,020
What is that? 80?

998
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,020
Please be honest.

999
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,020
I'm 28 years old.

1000
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,020
I'm 85 years old.

1001
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,020
I'm next to you.

1002
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,020
You don't have to be so big.

1003
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Thank you.

1004
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,020
It's my pleasure.

1005
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,020
Let's go.

1006
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,020
Please introduce yourself.

1007
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,020
Please start.

1008
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,020
Thank you.

1009
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,020
I like this.

1010
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,020
This is a kendo and anta.

1011
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,020
This is anta.

1012
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,020
This is anta.

1013
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,020
Can you tell me about your body?

1014
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,020
Body?

1015
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,020
Yes.

1016
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,020
I like the bones of my hips.

1017
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,020
Bones of your hips?

1018
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,020
Yes.

1019
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,020
Bones of your hips.

1020
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,020
I like being licked.

1021
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,020
I like strange things.

1022
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,020
I like strange things.

1023
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,020
How old are you?

1024
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,020
I'm 11 years old.

1025
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
Let's take a picture together.

1026
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,020
How old are you?

1027
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,020
I'll calculate it here.

1028
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,020
Please do it.

1029
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,020
How many pictures do you have?

1030
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,020
I have about 200 to 300 pictures.

1031
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,020
That's a lot.

1032
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,020
This is a good corner, isn't it?

1033
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020
Yes, yes, yes.

1034
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
I hope it will come out somehow.

1035
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,020
Hey, it's a little...

1036
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,020
This is a candidate, isn't it?

1037
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,020
It's a candidate.

1038
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,020
It smells like that.

1039
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,020
It smells like that.

1040
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,020
Do you understand me?

1041
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,020
I understand.

1042
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,020
I understand.

1043
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,020
30 seconds left.

1044
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,020
30 seconds left.

1045
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,020
I think you can do it.

1046
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,020
I might fail.

1047
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,020
What do you usually do?

1048
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,020
I usually go to the office.

1049
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,020
Today is the second day.

1050
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,020
It's been 10 seconds.

1051
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,020
10 seconds left.

1052
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,020
You just put your hand in.

1053
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,020
I thought you didn't.

1054
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,020
I'm watching you.

1055
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,020
5

1056
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,020
4

1057
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,020
3

1058
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:18,020
I'm sorry I can't do it.

1059
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,020
I can't do it.

1060
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:28,020
Let's say goodbye by showing your teeth.

1061
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:33,020
Thank you very much.

1062
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,020
Please introduce yourself.

1063
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,780
Yes, I'm Tsugumi. Nice to meet you.

1064
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,900
You don't have a beard, do you?

1065
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,180
I don't have a beard.

1066
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,680
Right?

1067
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,460
I don't have a beard.

1068
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,460
You have a lot of hair on your head, don't you?

1069
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,300
That's right.

1070
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,500
You have a lot of hair on your head, don't you?

1071
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,380
Yes.

1072
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,460
You have six hair on your head?

1073
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,100
Yes, I have six hair on my head.

1074
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,700
That's amazing.

1075
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,700
I have about the second hair on my head.

1076
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,300
Yes, that's good.

1077
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,740
What's your favorite part of your hair?

1078
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,940
My favorite part is black hair.

1079
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,700
Black hair?

1080
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,200
Yes.

1081
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,340
It's a little black.

1082
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,140
Black hair?

1083
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:04,640
Yes.

1084
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
You're a professional, aren't you?

1085
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Yes, I am.

1086
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,640
You don't have dark hair, do you?

1087
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,640
No, I don't.

1088
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,640
You have blonde hair, don't you?

1089
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,640
No, I've never dyed my hair.

1090
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,640
If you quit this job, maybe you want to have blonde hair.

1091
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,640
Blonde hair?

1092
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Yes.

1093
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
I'll make you look bad.

1094
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,640
Bad?

1095
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,640
I'll make you look like a mohawk.

1096
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,640
Mohawk?

1097
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,640
Yes.

1098
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,640
I don't have any plans.

1099
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,640
No, you don't.

1100
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,640
You'll be surprised if you make a mistake.

1101
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,640
Now, let's go inside!

1102
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
Oh, something is coming out.

1103
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
Oh, something is coming out?

1104
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,240
Something is coming out.

1105
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,740
How many balls are there?

1106
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,540
I think there are about 800 balls.

1107
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,240
I think there are about 1,000 balls.

1108
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,240
How many did you get?

1109
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
I got about 1000.

1110
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
Wow!

1111
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,240
When you go to DMF and search for Tsubomi, you'll see a lot of them.

1112
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,240
What should we look at among them?

1113
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
Who should we look at?

1114
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,240
Please look at Bakugasu.

1115
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,240
You've gotten better.

1116
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,240
I couldn't say that at all four years ago.

1117
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
It's getting dark.

1118
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
It's dark as if I'm in a tunnel.

1119
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Oh, this is a little...

1120
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
It's a little hot mode.

1121
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
It's getting bigger.

1122
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,240
It's not like this veteran is showing it to the camera.

1123
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
I was doing it.

1124
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Hot mode.

1125
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1126
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,240
Isn't it going to come out?

1127
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,240
Can you show it to the camera?

1128
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,240
It's a human, isn't it?

1129
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
Can you show it to the camera?

1130
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
Wow, it's delicious.

1131
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
You can eat it there.

1132
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
Like an ox.

1133
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
Show it to the camera.

1134
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
Wow, it's delicious.

1135
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,240
Do it again. Show it to the camera.

1136
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,240
It's delicious.

1137
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
It's delicious.

1138
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
Look at this.

1139
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,240
It's like a rice ball.

1140
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,240
It's delicious.

1141
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
Can I see it?

1142
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
It's a lot.

1143
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,240
Great.

1144
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,240
It's amazing.

1145
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
It's amazing.

1146
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,240
That's 1000.

1147
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,240
Drink it again.

1148
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
Are you going to show it again?

1149
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,240
Amazing!

1150
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
What?

1151
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
You got 5 points!

1152
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
Thank you very much.

1153
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Thank you very much.

1154
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,240
It was great.

1155
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
Now it's number 13.

1156
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,240
Please introduce yourself.

1157
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,240
I'm Ruka Kanae.

1158
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,240
Nice to meet you.

1159
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,240
It's a difficult word.

1160
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Do you read it as Kanae?

1161
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,240
It's not a good idea.

1162
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,240
Please tell me more.

1163
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,240
I'm Kanaeruka.

1164
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Please tell me the good points.

1165
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
The good points are...

1166
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
a big cat,

1167
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
a big eye,

1168
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,240
and a big waist.

1169
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,240
It's a big waist.

1170
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,240
It's a big waist.

1171
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,240
Don't do that.

1172
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,240
I don't want to.

1173
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,240
I have to show this to the camera.

1174
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,240
You said it's a big waist.

1175
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,240
I don't know.

1176
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,240
I didn't know.

1177
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
You don't wear it.

1178
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,240
I don't wear it.

1179
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,240
But I wear it.

1180
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
It's like a bra.

1181
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,240
I want to get that bra.

1182
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
I don't wear it.

1183
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,240
Do you wear it under your eyes?

1184
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,240
It's thick under my eyes.

1185
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
You wear it well.

1186
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,240
I'll introduce myself.

1187
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,240
Please.

1188
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,240
I'll introduce myself.

1189
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,240
I'm nervous.

1190
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
I'm already nervous.

1191
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Let's go!

1192
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,240
Let's go!

1193
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,240
Let's start the cut!

1194
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,240
Start?

1195
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
Let's start the cut.

1196
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,240
Something is coming out.

1197
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,240
Can you tell me how you feel?

1198
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,240
So, the chest and the other side?

1199
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,240
The other side?

1200
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,240
Yes.

1201
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,240
That's all you can do?

1202
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,240
Yes.

1203
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
What's your waist size?

1204
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:32,240
I'm 184 cm, 59 cm, and 85 cm.

1205
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,240
You did something strange there.

1206
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,740
What do you mean by that?

1207
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,240
Was it a bath?

1208
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:45,740
What?

1209
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,740
Was it a bath?

1210
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,740
What?

1211
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,740
You have it, don't you?

1212
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,240
Are you shooting?

1213
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,740
I'm shooting.

1214
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,740
Did you take a picture?

1215
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,740
No, I didn't.

1216
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,240
I was shooting.

1217
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,740
What?

1218
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,740
It's like a beach hut.

1219
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,740
Yeah, it's more like a trial and error kind of thing, isn't it?

1220
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,740
I see.

1221
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,740
Do you go outside when you go out?

1222
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,740
Yes, I do.

1223
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,740
Do you go to school?

1224
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,740
No.

1225
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,740
Private school?

1226
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,740
No, I don't go to school.

1227
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,740
I don't go to school.

1228
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,740
I can't go to school anymore.

1229
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:24,740
Once a year?

1230
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,740
Once a year.

1231
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,740
I go to school with 50 people.

1232
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,740
That's more, right?

1233
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,740
Yes.

1234
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,740
That's a little different, isn't it?

1235
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,740
500 people?

1236
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,740
That's a lot.

1237
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,740
5,000 people?

1238
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,740
That's a lot.

1239
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,740
Is it different?

1240
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,740
But they're all the same person.

1241
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,740
You can't control that.

1242
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,740
What kind of sex do you like?

1243
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,740
I like lovey-dovey kind of sex.

1244
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,740
What do you think?

1245
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,740
You're kidding me?

1246
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,740
You're kidding me?

1247
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,740
10 seconds left.

1248
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,740
5 seconds left.

1249
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,740
That was close.

1250
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,740
I'm glad you did your best.

1251
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,740
There are still many more, so please do your best.

1252
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,740
Thank you very much.

1253
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,740
Number 14.

1254
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,740
Are you nervous?

1255
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,740
I want to go home.

1256
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,740
Please introduce yourself.

1257
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,740
I'm Hikaru Kanna.

1258
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,740
Yes, I am.

1259
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,740
Can you sum up your self-experience in 30 seconds?

1260
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,740
No, I don't have anything to say.

1261
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,740
Please go ahead.

1262
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,740
Well...

1263
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,740
My three sizes are...

1264
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:34,740
...82, 58, 86, and...

1265
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,740
...my favorite type is...

1266
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,740
...back.

1267
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,740
Why?

1268
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,740
I like it.

1269
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,740
This time too.

1270
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,740
I want to be asked from behind.

1271
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,740
I want to be asked from behind.

1272
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,740
I said it was difficult.

1273
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,740
I said it was difficult.

1274
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,740
I want to get some experience.

1275
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,740
Experience?

1276
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,740
Including the scene.

1277
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,740
Including the scene? You're not lying.

1278
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,740
Right?

1279
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,740
100...

1280
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,740
100 points.

1281
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,740
About 130.

1282
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:09,740
It's about 30.

1283
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,740
It's real, isn't it?

1284
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,740
Yes.

1285
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,740
What are the three points?

1286
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,740
The three points are...

1287
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,740
a smile.

1288
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,740
You ran away.

1289
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,740
I didn't run away.

1290
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,740
Then smile, please.

1291
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,740
I'll take about three minutes.

1292
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,740
Do you need three minutes of a smile?

1293
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
I need it.

1294
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,740
You don't need it.

1295
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,740
You're going to cut it at all, aren't you?

1296
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,740
Okay, let's go with that.

1297
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,740
He says he wants to put it out.

1298
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,740
He's full of motivation.

1299
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,740
Is that so?

1300
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,740
I'll do my best.

1301
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,740
Start!

1302
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,740
Thank you for waiting.

1303
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:49,740
What would you like to be if you were to be born?

1304
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,740
Salmon.

1305
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,740
Salmon?

1306
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,740
Yes.

1307
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,740
Salmon.

1308
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,740
Salmon?

1309
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,740
Yes.

1310
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,740
Why?

1311
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,740
I want to climb it.

1312
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,740
You want to climb it?

1313
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,740
Yes.

1314
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,740
You're going to break it.

1315
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,740
You can survive there, right?

1316
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,740
Yes.

1317
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,740
I can survive.

1318
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,740
You're going to die before that.

1319
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,740
Yes.

1320
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,740
It's broken in the tournament.

1321
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,740
How was it?

1322
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,740
I want to write it down.

1323
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,740
Did you write it down?

1324
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,740
10 seconds ago.

1325
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,740
No.

1326
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,740
10 seconds ago.

1327
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,740

1328
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,740

Thank you very much.

1342
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:04,740
Number 15 has powered up.

1343
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,740
Please introduce yourself.

1344
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,740
I'm Mirai Mikami.

1345
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,740
Nice to meet you.

1346
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,740
Nice to meet you.

1347
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,740
Please tell us your charm points.

1348
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,740
I want everyone to see this.

1349
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,740
My charm points are

1350
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,740
mouth and tongue.

1351
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,740
Mouth and tongue?

1352
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,740
Please tell us your high-speed tongue.

1353
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,740
What's this?

1354
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,740
A

1355
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,740
Ijiri Okada

1356
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,740
More more more

1357
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,740
More

1358
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,740
Too fast

1359
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,740
It's not

1360
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,740
It's not

1361
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,740
It's not

1362
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:37,740
It's not fast

1363
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,740
It's long

1364
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,740
It's long

1365
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,740
Sorry

1366
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,740
I'll show you the long one

1367
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,740
Here we go

1368
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,740
It's long

1369
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,740
It's long

1370
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,740
It's long

1371
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,740
It's a long name

1372
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,740
It's a long name

1373
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,740
It's a long name

1374
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,740
What's your favorite food?

1375
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,740
What's your favorite food?

1376
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,740
My favorite food is a fried shrimp

1377
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:52,740
What's your favorite food?

1378
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,740
Not a mandarin

1379
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:31,740
This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of thing in real life.

1380
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,740
It's amazing.

1381
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,740
It looks good.

1382
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,740
It feels good.

1383
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,740
It looks really good.

1384
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,740
It's entwined.

1385
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,740
Please introduce yourself.

1386
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,740
I'm Yoppi.

1387
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:53,740
You're Yoppi, right?

1388
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,740
Yes, I am.

1389
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,740
What about the second one?

1390
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:59,740
Which one?

1391
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,740
Hmm?

1392
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,740
The second one?

1393
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,740
Yes, the second one.

1394
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,740
I'm going to put it on my wrist and wrist.

1395
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,740
It's good, isn't it?

1396
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,740
It looks good.

1397
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,740
It's a long way down, isn't it?

1398
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,740
If there is a place where I can't go, I will be disappointed.

1399
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,740
It's a good taste, isn't it?

1400
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,740
Yes.

1401
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,740
It's a good taste.

1402
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,740
10 pieces.

1403
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,740
This is the end of the race.

1404
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,740
I failed.

1405
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,740
Why did you fail?

1406
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,740
I'm sorry.

1407
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,740
Please do your best.

1408
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,740
Yes, thank you very much.

1409
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,740
Thank you very much.

1410
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,740
It's number 16.

1411
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,740
Thank you very much.

1412
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,740
Please introduce yourself.

1413
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,740
I'm Uehara Ai.

1414
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,740
Uehara-san, have you been on the internet before?

1415
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,740
This is my third time.

1416
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,740
Thank you very much.

1417
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,740
When I search on the internet,

1418
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,740
Uehara has quite a reputation.

1419
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,740
Really?

1420
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,740
As far as I can see.

1421
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,740
I'm happy. Thank you very much.

1422
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,740
Please do your best.

1423
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,740
What is the jump point?

1424
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,740
The jump point is the pink collar.

1425
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,740
Pink? Did you just say pink?

1426
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,740
It's always pink.

1427
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,740
It's not mixed at all.

1428
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,740
It's not mixed with brown.

1429
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,740
It's not mixed.

1430
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:30,740
There is no doubt.

1431
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:31,740
There is no doubt.

1432
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,740
It's definitely pink.

1433
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,740
Probably.

1434
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,740
Let's see it.

1435
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,740
Will you see it?

1436
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,740
What do you think?

1437
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,740
It's not a shocking pink color, is it?

1438
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,740
No, it's not.

1439
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,740
I'm surprised.

1440
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,740
It's my first time.

1441
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,740
Can I touch it?

1442
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,740
I think it's good.

1443
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,740
Please let me touch it.

1444
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,740
It's pink.

1445
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,740
It's really pink.

1446
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,740
That's right.

1447
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,740
Is it always pink?

1448
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:14,740
It's always pink.

1449
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,740
I'm sure it'll turn black 3 times.

1450
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,740
No, it won't.

1451
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,740
It'll turn black 50 times or 60 times.

1452
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,740
I don't like that.

1453
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,740
That's great.

1454
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,740
Maybe one side is black.

1455
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,740
Please look at it.

1456
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:31,740
It's the same.

1457
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,740
That's right.

1458
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,740
How is it?

1459
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,740
There is such a pink.

1460
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,740
I'm glad.

1461
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,740
Let me touch it.

1462
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,740
What kind of touch should I do?

1463
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,740
I like the way you touch it.

1464
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,740
I like that kind of feeling.

1465
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,740
It's coming out.

1466
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,740
It's very hard.

1467
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,740
I'm getting stiff.

1468
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,740
What do you touch?

1469
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,740
Carbohydrate.

1470
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,740
Carbohydrate.

1471
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,740
It doesn't matter.

1472
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,740
Let's start.

1473
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,740
Let's introduce ourselves.

1474
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,740
Please start.

1475
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,740
I'm sorry.

1476
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,740
Let's start again.

1477
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,740
I'm sorry.

1478
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,740
I'm sorry.

1479
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,740
Let's start again.

1480
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,740
You've seen a lot of things.

1481
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,740
Yes.

1482
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,740
Is it a big one?

1483
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,740
Yes.

1484
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,740
It's a big one.

1485
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,740
Yes.

1486
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,740
But I've seen a lot of things.

1487
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,740
That's right.

1488
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,740
Where should I look at?

1489
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,740
I wonder if there is a place to look at.

1490
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,740
What kind of place do you want me to look at?

1491
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,740
I want you to look at a place where you are enjoying yourself.

1492
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:09,740
I want you to look at a place where everyone is enjoying themselves.

1493
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,740
Then, I will follow this camera only to Uehara.

1494
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,740
Is that okay?

1495
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,740
I'm so happy.

1496
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,740
What's the most simple thing you can do?

1497
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,740
The most simple thing is ears and...

1498
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,740
I'm going to do a live.

1499
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,740
Please do it.

1500
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,740
What kind of support do you like?

1501
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,740
I like that.

1502
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,740
What kind of support?

1503
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,740
Something like...

1504
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,740
Sweet words?

1505
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,740
Sweet words.

1506
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,740
Sweet words?

1507
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,740
Sweet words.

1508
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,740
It's a sweet taste.

1509
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,740
It's delicious.

1510
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,740
It's not good for me.

1511
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,740
I'm happy.

1512
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,740
It's very hard.

1513
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,740
Is it the sound of a keyboard?

1514
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,740
It's hard to see on the screen.

1515
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,740
It's hard to see on the screen.

1516
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,740
It's hard to see on the screen.

1517
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,740
It's hard to see on the screen.

1518
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,740
I want you to participate more and more.

1519
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:18,740
Yes, I want you to participate more and more.

1520
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,740
I went too far.

1521
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,740
Did it come out?

1522
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,740
I think so.

1523
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,740
Do you want me to wait?

1524
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:03,740
This is the first time I've ever had this kind of food in my life.

1525
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,740
Do you have any goals or ambitions?

1526
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,740
I'll do my best to keep going.

1527
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,740
There's a car behind you.

1528
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:26,740
I want to be the best in the world.

1529
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:30,740
In this industry?

1530
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,740
Yes.

1531
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:32,740
In the United States?

1532
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,740
Yes.

1533
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,740
In the United States?

1534
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,740
Yes.

1535
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,740
I think Moodys is the best.

1536
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,740
Yes.

1537
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,740
Right?

1538
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,740
Yes.

1539
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,740
You and Aima.

1540
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,740
Yes.

1541
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:43,740
Together.

1542
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,740
Together.

1543
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,740
Wow!

1544
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,740
It's so long!

1545
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,740
It's amazing!

1546
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,740
Amazing!

1547
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,740
It's so long!

1548
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:29,740
Please hold it up high.

1549
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,740
Hold it up high.

1550
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:36,740
Pull it down like you're drinking wine.

1551
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,740
Then, turn it around.

1552
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:45,740
Even if you bring it to your throat once, it's delicious.

1553
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,740
Oh, I drank it! Great!

1554
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,740
It was delicious.

1555
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,740
It was like drinking wine from an old age.

1556
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,740
It was a wonderful drink.

1557
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,740
It was amazing.

1558
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,740
How many days did you drink it?

1559
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:15,740
Thank you very much.

1560
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,740
Thank you very much.

1561
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:24,740
Thank you very much.

1562
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,740
I will come to the inn soon.

1563
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:35,740
So everyone, since it's a box bus, don't you want to put it in the bus?

1564
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:38,740
Yeah!

1565
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,740
Let's put it in!

1566
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,740
Let's put it in!

1567
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:49,740
So let's put it in the bus as much as we can!

1568
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,740
One, two!

1569
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:55,740
Seat belt! High-speed sex!

1570
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:02,740
Yes!

1571
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,740
According to the instructions given by the person in the next seat and Mr. Ken Ken,

1572
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:10,740
It is a sex where everyone plays the same.

1573
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:16,740
However, men should never take off their seat belts.

1574
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:22,740
Let's split it in time, so let's do it together.

1575
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,740
Let's get started.

1576
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:29,740
The two of you, please take a seat.

1577
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:30,740
Yes.

1578
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,740
Itch-ka.

1579
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,740
What?

1580
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:33,740
Itch-ka.

1581
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,740
Itch-ka.

1582
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:37,740
Itch-ka.

1583
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:38,740
Yes.

1584
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,740
Itch-ka.

1585
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,740
Everyone is waiting for you.

1586
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:52,740
Let's start from the French kiss to the deep kiss.

1587
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,740
It's French.

1588
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,740
It's French.

1589
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:05,740
It's soft.

1590
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,740
Because it's French.

1591
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,740
It's soft.

1592
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,740
It's soft.

1593
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,740
It's soft.

1594
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,740
Really?

1595
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,740
It's deep.

1596
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,740
Can I kiss you?

1597
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,740
It's okay.

1598
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,740
Do you want me to take a picture of you?

1599
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,740
How is it?

1600
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,740
Both of you are very sensitive.

1601
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,740
Do you want to lick it?

1602
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,740
You haven't licked it yet.

1603
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:22,740
Not yet?

1604
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,740
Not yet?

1605
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:26,740
Not yet?

1606
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,740
You are the only one who can do this.

1607
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:03,740
I'm sorry.

1608
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,740
I'm sorry.

1609
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:09,740
I'm sorry.

1610
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,740
I'm sorry.

1611
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:15,740
I'm sorry.

1612
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:18,740
I'm sorry.

1613
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,740
I'm sorry.

1614
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,740
I'm sorry.

1615
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,740
I'm so tired.

1616
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,740
Sit down.

1617
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,740
I'm so tired.

1618
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,740
I'm so tired.

1619
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,740
It feels so good.

1620
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,740
Ta-da!

1621
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,740
Look, it's a tea bag.

1622
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,740
Oh, you're right.

1623
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:00,740
How is it?

1624
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,740
It's super erotic.

1625
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:05,740
Can I take a picture of you?

1626
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,740
Here you go.

1627
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:15,740
How is it?

1628
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,740
Everyone, how is the blanket?

1629
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,740
I can't see anything yet.

1630
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,740
I can't see anything.

1631
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,740
I'm scared.

1632
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,740
Is it beautiful?

1633
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,740
Wait a minute.

1634
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,740
What?

1635
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,740
Is it okay?

1636
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,740
Thank you.

1637
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,740
You don't like it?

1638
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,740
You don't like it?

1639
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,740
Mom, I'm sorry.

1640
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,740
I'm sorry.

1641
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,740
I'm sorry.

1642
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,740
Oh, it feels good.

1643
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,740
Oh, it feels good.

1644
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,740
The curve is complete.

1645
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:31,740
...

1646
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:35,740
...

1647
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:39,740
...

1648
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:43,740
...

1649
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:47,740
...

1650
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:51,740
...

1651
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:55,740
...

1652
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:58,740
Please turn to the left and turn to the right.

1653
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,740
Please turn to the left and turn to the right.

1654
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,740
I can't believe it.

1655
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:39,740
Wait, wait, wait!

1656
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,740
No, no, no!

1657
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,740
I can't do it!

1658
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,740
No, no, no!

1659
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,740
Where? Here?

1660
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,740
No, no, no!

1661
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,740
Really?

1662
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,740
Here?

1663
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,740
Yes.

1664
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,740
No, no, no!

1665
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,740
No, no, no!

1666
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,740
No, no, no!

1667
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,740
No, no, no!

1668
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,740
No, no, no!

1669
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:37,740
I'm sorry.

1670
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:51,740
I'm sorry.

1671
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:54,740
I want to go to the toilet.

1672
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,740
I want to put it in my mouth.

1673
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,740
I want to put it in my mouth.

1674
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:23,740
I want to eat!

1675
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,740
Say it!

1676
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,740
I want to eat!

1677
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,740
I want to eat!

1678
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:37,740
Let's stop eating.

1679
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,740
Let's go!

1680
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:43,740
Let me in!

1681
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:47,740
Everyone, let's go to the warehouse!

1682
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,740
I'll put condoms on!

1683
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,740
I'm so sorry.

1684
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,740
I can't stand it anymore.

1685
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:09,740
Oh, my God.

1686
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,740
Aika, number 8.

1687
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:23,740
What's going on?

1688
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:29,740
I don't know what you think, but I'll try it later.

1689
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,740
Can I put it in now?

1690
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:33,740
What are you going to do?

1691
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:35,740
I want to do it.

1692
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:37,740
I want to do it.

1693
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,740
If you think about it, it's not a bus.

1694
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:43,740
It's okay, so let me put it in quickly.

1695
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:50,740
Everyone, please enter the room.

1696
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:56,740
Everyone, please enter the room.

1697
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:00,740
Everyone, please wear a mask.

1698
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,740
Can I stay at home?

1699
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:08,740
I'm going to fall asleep.

1700
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,740
It's okay.

1701
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,740
It's gone.

1702
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:23,740
No, don't go yet.

1703
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,740
Oh my god!

1704
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:26,740
Oh, it's painful.

1705
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,740
Oh, it's painful.

1706
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,740
It's so cute!

1707
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,740
It's so heart-pounding.

1708
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:23,740
Let's go!

1709
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,740
Look!

1710
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,740
They are very excited.

1711
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,740
There are a lot of them!

1712
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,740
Let's go!

1713
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,740
Let's go!

1714
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:41,740
Please hold it.

1715
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,740
Ta-da!

1716
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:45,740
There are so many.

1717
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,740
Do you want to drink?

1718
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,740
Please drink.

1719
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:51,740
I'm so happy.

1720
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:59,740
I ate it.

1721
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,740
I'm so happy.

1722
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:07,740
Let's go.

1723
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:11,740
Give me your hand.

1724
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,740
Give me.

1725
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:17,740
I'm sweating.

1726
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,740
I'm sweating.

1727
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,740
Do you want to see?

1728
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,740
I'm saying, I'm sweating.

1729
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,740
I'm sweating.

1730
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:27,740
There are so many people.

1731
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:29,740
Can you take off your gloves and show them?

1732
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:31,740
There are so many people.

1733
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:33,740
There are so many people.

1734
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,740
I'm sweating.

1735
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:39,740
It's hot.

1736
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,740
It's hot.

1737
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:43,740
There are so many people.

1738
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,740
I'm sweating a lot.

1739
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,740
It's not over yet.

1740
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,740
It's hot.

1741
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,740
Are you okay?

1742
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,740
Are you hurt?

1743
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,740
It's okay.

1744
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,740
I want to go home.

1745
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:43,740
Thank you.

1746
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:54,740
One more minute.

1747
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:26,740
It's gone.

1748
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,740
It's gone.

1749
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,740
It's gone.

1750
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,740
Amazing.

1751
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,740
Show me.

1752
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,740
Show it to the camera.

1753
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,740
How did you feel?

1754
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:00,740
I felt good.

1755
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,740
What happened to your back?

1756
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,740
Oh, my God!

1757
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,740
I feel like I'm going to wipe my back.

1758
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:09,740
Hold on! Hold on!

1759
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:29,740
30 seconds left.

1760
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:31,740
30 seconds left.

1761
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,740
Please hurry up!

1762
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:36,740
Hurry up!

1763
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,740
Hurry up!

1764
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:42,740
10 seconds left!

1765
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,740
Hurry up!

1766
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:53,740
Hurry up!

1767
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:56,740
10 seconds left!

1768
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,740
I don't think so.

1769
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:00,740
How is it?

1770
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:09,740
It's finished.

1771
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:17,740
Everyone, it's finished.

1772
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:27,740
Let's take a look at the front of the bus.

1773
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:33,740
It was a little hot, but how is it?

1774
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:36,740
It feels good to be close to each other when it's hot.

1775
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:41,740
It feels good to be close to each other when we're sweating.

1776
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:45,740
There is a person who seems to die, but is it okay?

1777
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,740
Are you okay?

1778
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:49,740
Are you okay?

1779
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:51,740
It's okay.

1780
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:53,740
It was good, wasn't it?

1781
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:55,740
Yes.

1782
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:59,740
What happened to Dote-kun?

1783
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:01,740
What happened?

1784
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,740
Did you do it or not?

1785
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:05,740
I did it.

1786
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,740
Which one?

1787
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:09,740
It's not good.

1788
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:13,740
It was a little hot, wasn't it?

1789
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,740
My memories are like this.

1790
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:19,740
I'm sure there's something like that.

1791
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:22,740
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

1792
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,740
That's all.

1793
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:27,740
It was a high-speed set of seat belts.

1794
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:30,740
Yeah!

1795
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,740
Thank you.

1796
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,740
Let's do it again.

1797
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:58,740
Cute.

1798
01:44:58,740 --> 01:44:59,740
Cute.

1799
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:00,740
Cute.

1800
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:01,740
Aloha.

1801
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:02,740
Cute.

1802
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:03,740
Everyone is different.

1803
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,740
Everyone is different?

1804
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:05,740
Everyone is different.

1805
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:06,740
Oh, I have to take a picture.

1806
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,740
Cute.

1807
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:09,740
I feel like I'm a professional.

1808
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:13,740
I want to be a boxer.

1809
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,740
I want to be a boxer.

1810
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,740
Look, look.

1811
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:21,740
There might be someone else.

1812
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,740
No way.

1813
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:25,740
I made a mistake.

1814
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:27,740
I made a mistake.

1815
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:29,740
I don't like cute girls.

1816
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,740
I don't like cute girls.

1817
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:33,740
What do you mean?

1818
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,740
I don't like cute girls.

1819
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,740
It's so cute.

1820
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:13,740
It's Chaya.

1821
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:19,740
It's huge.

1822
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:21,740
It's so cute.

1823
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:23,740
What is it?

1824
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:27,740
It's so cute.

1825
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:29,740
So cute!

1826
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:31,740
I want to see it.

1827
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:33,740
It's so different.

1828
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:35,740
It's cute.

1829
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:39,740
It's cute.

1830
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,740
I want to see it.

1831
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:43,740
Look at this.

1832
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:45,740
It's cute.

1833
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:47,740
I was surprised.

1834
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:49,740
I was embarrassed.

1835
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:51,740
I was embarrassed.

1836
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,740
I can't open it.

1837
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:58,740
I wonder if this is the same as the one on my lips.

1838
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:05,740
I don't know.

1839
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:09,740
It's cute.

1840
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,740
It's an adornment, isn't it?

1841
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:13,740
You can't change your swimsuit, Ayu.

1842
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,740
She's laughing.

1843
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,740
What are you laughing at?

1844
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,740
But it's sexy.

1845
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,740
I'm not a mother.

1846
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,740
I'm a loli.

1847
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:30,740
I'm a loli.

1848
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:32,740
I'm a loli.

1849
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:34,740
I'm a lexie.

1850
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:35,740
I'm a chida.

1851
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:37,740
I'm a chida.

1852
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:39,740
I'm a tatsui.

1853
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:42,740
It's a juggler.

1854
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:45,740
It's a juggler.

1855
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:50,740
Wait! If there's a hole, it'll be like this.

1856
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,740
Everyone, please follow me!

1857
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,740
Yay!

1858
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:32,740
Wow!

1859
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,740
It's amazing!

1860
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:42,740
It's like a fairy tale.

1861
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:45,740
What is it?

1862
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:47,740
It's like a fairy tale.

1863
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:49,740
I see something!

1864
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,740
Oh, there's something!

1865
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,740
There's something!

1866
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:55,740
Everyone, the one in your right hand is...

1867
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,740
...Lucky Life!

1868
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,740
So cute!

1869
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:05,740
What's that?

1870
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:07,740
Take a picture of Gomi-san.

1871
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,740
Take a picture of Gomi-san.

1872
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:11,740
She's wearing a nurse's costume.

1873
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:13,740
Oh, no!

1874
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:15,740
So cute!

1875
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:17,740
She's so cute!

1876
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:18,740
What's wrong?

1877
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,740
I'm getting dizzy!

1878
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,740
I can't stop!

1879
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:25,740
I'm getting dizzy!

1880
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:32,740
I'm getting dizzy!

1881
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:37,740
This is the charm of Bako Bako Land!

1882
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:40,740
I can't stop!

1883
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,740
Did you see it?

1884
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,740
I saw it!

1885
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:50,740
I want Chikkun!

1886
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,740
I want Chikkun!

1887
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:53,740
Oh no!

1888
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:54,740
Oh no!

1889
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:55,740
The dino!

1890
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,740
The dino is here!

1891
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:59,740
The dino is here!

1892
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,740
Give me the dino!

1893
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:17,740
Give me the dino!

1894
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:19,740
Give me the dino!

1895
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:21,740
I'm sorry.

1896
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:23,740
I'm sorry.

1897
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,740
What are you doing?

1898
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:27,740
I'm so sorry.

1899
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,740
That's it!

1900
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,740
5th place!

1901
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:07,740
Go!

1902
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,740
1st and 2nd place!

1903
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:13,740
There are men too!

1904
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:16,740
Let's start with the girls.

1905
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,740
The girls will sit side by side.

1906
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,740
11th and 12th place!

1907
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,740
I'm hungry!

1908
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,740
I wanted to go when I felt like it.

1909
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,740
One more curry, please.

1910
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:44,740
Rice!

1911
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:47,740
Please give me a small amount.

1912
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:49,740
Please give me a small amount.

1913
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:55,740
What do you want to drink?

1914
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:56,740
Orange?

1915
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:57,740
Orange juice?

1916
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,740
Orange juice?

1917
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,740
I can't drink it.

1918
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:09,740
Everyone, itadakimasu!

1919
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:11,740
Itadakimasu!

1920
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:13,740
Itadakimasu!

1921
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:14,740
Itadakimasu!

1922
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,740
Is it good?

1923
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:21,740
I did it!

1924
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:22,740
It's good!

1925
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:27,740
Let's try the potatoes!

1926
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:29,740
Is it good?

1927
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:31,740
It's good!

1928
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:32,740
It's good!

1929
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:33,740
I did it!

1930
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:35,740
It's good!

1931
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:37,740
Let's go!

1932
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:39,740
Ta-da!

1933
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:45,740
It's a sudden interview with Otoha Narase's lunch!

1934
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,740
Yay!

1935
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:57,740
So now, I'm going to go see how everyone is getting along with each other.

1936
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:59,740
Let's go!

1937
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:07,740
Oh, it's already started.

1938
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:09,740
It's moving.

1939
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:19,740
Please.

1940
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:20,740
Please.

1941
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,740
Please.

1942
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,740
Wait.

1943
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:24,740
I'll try it.

1944
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:26,740
Here we go.

1945
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:30,740
It's good.

1946
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,740
Is it?

1947
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:32,740
It's good!

1948
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:40,740
I finished half a piece.

1949
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:43,740
Do you drink water?

1950
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:45,740
Not yet.

1951
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:46,740
You don't?

1952
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:48,740
No, I don't.

1953
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:51,740
Then, your throat is dry.

1954
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:52,740
It's a little dry.

1955
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:53,740
It's a little dry?

1956
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:54,740
Yes.

1957
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:58,740
Then, I'll put some water on your dry throat.

1958
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,740
Is it okay if I do it?

1959
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:03,740
Yes.

1960
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:04,740
You can spit it out.

1961
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:05,740
Is it okay if I do it?

1962
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,740
From me?

1963
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:08,740
Yes.

1964
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:09,740
You can do it from this side.

1965
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,740
I want to do it from this side.

1966
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:12,740
I did it.

1967
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:13,740
It's delicious.

1968
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,740
Delicious!

1969
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:24,740
Thank you very much.

1970
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:26,740
I'm so proud of you.

1971
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:27,740
Delicious!

1972
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:29,740
Who wants to drink orange juice?

1973
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,740
Yes!

1974
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,740
Please, please, please.

1975
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,740
Please, please, please.

1976
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,740
Please, please, please.

1977
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,740
Please, please, please.

1978
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:37,740
Rock, paper, scissors!

1979
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,740
Who wants to drink beer?

1980
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:41,740
Me.

1981
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:46,940
Then please drink this orange juice together.

1982
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:47,940
Yes!

1983
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,940
It's delicious.

1984
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:49,940
What should I do?

1985
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:51,940
Drink.

1986
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:55,940
But it's embarrassing.

1987
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:59,940
It's about to come back.

1988
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:05,940
Oh, three are facing each other.

1989
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:10,940
Don't let go of it.

1990
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:12,940
You can't eat it all at once.

1991
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,940
You can drink all of it.

1992
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:15,940
I don't know.

1993
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,940
We ate it all.

1994
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:26,940
We ate it all.

1995
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:28,940
So cute.

1996
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:36,940
That's it for today's interview!

1997
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:38,940
See you later!

1998
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,940
Thank you for your hard work.

1999
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:21,940
I would like you to experience the Bako Bako Land attraction.

2000
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:27,940
I would like to choose the person who will explain it with a lottery.

2001
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:32,940
Please choose the person who will explain it with a lottery.

2002
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:36,940
The person with the lottery is the person who will explain it with a lottery.

2003
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,940
You haven't seen it yet, have you?

2004
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:40,940
No, I haven't seen it yet.

2005
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:42,940
It's behind you.

2006
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:43,940
Go ahead.

2007
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:45,940
There's something on it.

2008
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:46,940
Go ahead.

2009
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:49,940
You'll know if you hit it.

2010
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:50,940
Do you understand?

2011
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:51,940
Yes.

2012
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:52,940
I don't understand.

2013
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:53,940
Go ahead.

2014
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,940
Here we go.

2015
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:56,940
Go ahead.

2016
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,940
I wonder who it is.

2017
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:00,940
Go ahead.

2018
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:02,940
It's random.

2019
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:04,940
It's stable.

2020
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:07,940
Are you sure you're not going to be the host?

2021
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:08,940
You're not here!

2022
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:10,940
That's all.

2023
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:12,940
Congratulations.

2024
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:14,940
Thank you.

2025
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:18,940
You're the best host in Japan.

2026
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:20,940
Please give me the script.

2027
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:24,940
I'll give you the explanation.

2028
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,940
What are you doing now?

2029
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:34,940
Who is the host?

2030
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:38,940
I'm the host, Ichika Tomihata.

2031
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:41,940
I'm Ichi-deo.

2032
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:45,940
I will explain the first attraction.

2033
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:50,940
The name of the attraction is Bako Bako Ero Jungle.

2034
01:58:57,940 --> 01:58:59,940
I will explain.

2035
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:04,940
The two of you will be a pair and explore the jungle in the pool.

2036
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:14,940
This jungle is an erotic jungle, so you can experience various erotic things just by walking.

2037
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:17,940
Please stand by.

2038
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,940
Yes!

2039
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:26,440
Let's start the Bako Bako Edo Jungle!

2040
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,440
This is the Disney attraction!

2041
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:43,940
Thank you.

2042
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:45,940
Please

2043
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:21,940
Thank you very much.

2044
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:26,940
This is Chikubiname attraction.

2045
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:30,940
I made a mistake.

2046
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:32,940
Thank you

2047
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,940
Thank you

2048
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:53,940
Thank you

2049
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:56,940
Thank you

2050
02:01:57,940 --> 02:01:59,940
Thank you

2051
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:01,940
Thank you very much.

2052
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:34,940
Thank you very much.

2053
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:43,940

Excuse me.

2056
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:52,940
It's been a long time.

02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:55,940
It's been a long time.

2058

Wow!

2060
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:00,940
Can I put it down?

2061
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:03,940
Why is it so heavy?

2062
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,940
Excuse me.

2063
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,940

Wow!

2067
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:16,940
My head is full.

2068
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:20,940
My head is full.

2069
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:25,940
Does it feel good?

2070
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:26,940
Wow!

2071
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:29,940
The water is coming out from the first step.

There's a lot coming out!

2077
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:02,940
It's so slippery!

2078
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,940
I'm so happy.

2079

Well...

2102
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:07,940
I like the one in the front.

2103
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:08,940
The one in the front?

Something is coming out.

2107
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:21,940
What is this?

2108
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:25,940
Look, it's very slippery.

2109
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:29,940
Take it out like this.

2110
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:31,940
It's a naughty kitten.

2111
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:33,940
Thank you.

2112
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:35,940
Thank you.

2113
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,940
I was scared.

2114
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:51,940
It's okay.

2115
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,940
It's a waste.

2116
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,940
Amazing.

2131
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:01,940
What do you like?

Which one do you like?

2144
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:27,940
Left or right?

2145
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:29,940
Asakipo and Nemo are tall.

2146
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:30,940

Well, like this.

2152

Yakuwari-san.

2154
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:42,940
Both hands.

2155
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:43,940
Both hands?

2156
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:46,940
I wonder if it's okay to touch them.

2157
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:48,940
Kindly?

2158
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:50,940
Kindly.

2159

Excuse me.

2175
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:54,940
I'm going to stop.

2176
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:14,940
Which part do you like?

2177
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,940
I like the crab part.

2178
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:19,940
Do you want to drink it?

02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:28,940
Does it feel good?

2180
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:01,940
You're looking at the baby, aren't you?

2181
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:09,940
You look so happy.

2182
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:15,940
Are you happy?

2183
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,940
You look so happy.

2184
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:22,940
You look so happy.

2185
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:24,940
Please go back to sleep.

2186
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:26,940
Please go back to sleep.

2187
02:13:26,940 --> 02:13:28,940
I'm going to make it smooth.

2188
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,940
I'm getting energetic.

2189
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:32,940
I'm going to make it smooth.

2190
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:38,940
It's hot.

2191
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:40,940
I'm rubbing against a heavy girl.

2192
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:42,940
I'm rubbing against a heavy girl.

2193
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:46,940
Do you understand?

2194
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:48,940
I'm rubbing against a heavy girl.

2195
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:50,940
She's rubbing it with a treat.

2196
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:56,940
It's so bright red.

2197
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:01,940
You like being rubbed, don't you?

2198
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:04,940
I feel like I'm going to die.

2199
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:07,940
It feels good.

2200
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,940
It's so warm.

2201
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:13,940
It's melting.

2202
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:16,940
It's melting and going to disappear.

2203
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:18,940
Oh, it feels good.

2204
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,940
Oh, it feels good.

2205
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:31,940
How do you feel?

2206

2208
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:36,940
I'll see you later.

2209
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:38,940
You're glowing.

2210
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:40,940
You're glowing.

2211
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:46,940
Do you like this cup?

2212
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:48,940
I like it.

2213
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:50,940
It's small.

2214
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:52,940
It is a cup.

2215
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:54,940
It's a cup.

2216
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:57,940
It's so soft.

2217
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:03,940
I can understand the tingling.

2218
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:07,940
It's getting hot, isn't it?

2219
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:15,940
It's so hot.

2220
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:28,940
What's wrong?

2221
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:31,940
Are you hot?

2222
02:15:31,940 --> 02:15:32,940
I'm sweating.

2223
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:35,240
Me too.

2224
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:49,940
Thank you very much.

2225
02:15:49,940 --> 02:15:51,940
Thank you very much.

Take care.

2227
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:56,940
One, two.

2228
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:57,940
Welcome.

2229
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:59,940
This is the request area.

2230
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:01,940
What do you want me to do?

2231
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,940
What do you want me to do?

2232
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:04,940
What do you want me to do?

2233
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:05,940
What do you want me to do?

2234
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:06,940
I want you to do Terachio.

2235
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:07,940
Terachio?

2236
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:08,940
Terachio, please.

2237
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:09,940
Okay, thank you.

2238
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:10,940
I'm going to try it.

2239
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:12,940
Is it good?

2240
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:14,940
Is it good?

2241
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:16,940
Is it good?

2242
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:45,940
I like it.

2243
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:57,940
I really like it.

2244
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:00,940
Do you feel good?

2245
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,940
I haven't done anything yet.

2246
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:09,940
It's very soft.

2247
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:11,940
It's very soft.

2248
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:13,940
It's ticklish.

2249
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:15,940
Don't touch it.

2250
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:17,940
Sorry, Mingo.

2251
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:19,940
It's ticklish.

2252
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:23,940
It's ticklish.

2253
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:25,940
My whole body is ticklish.

2254
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,940
It's very ticklish.

2255
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:37,940
Oh, it's so good.

2256
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:40,940
She's rubbing it so much.

2257
02:17:43,940 --> 02:17:45,940
She's rubbing it so much.

2258
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:50,940
Don't touch it. It's a desert area.

2259
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:52,940
Thank you for your hard work.

2260
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:54,940
Thank you for your hard work.

2261
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:57,940
Your body looks surprised.

2262
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:16,940
Did you feel good?

2263
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:18,940
Thank you very much.

2264
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:22,940
This is the ice hockey zone.

2265
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:28,940
That was so lame.

2266
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:31,940
I knew it.

2267
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,940
Your feet are so cool.

2268
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:42,940
Really?

2269
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:44,940
Thank you.

2270
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:47,940
I'll just do it in front of you.

2271
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:49,940
Thank you.

2272
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:52,940
Squishy, squishy, squishy.

2273
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:57,940
Do you have any special experiences?

2274
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:02,940
I love this.

2275
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:04,940
Do you want to try it yourself?

2276
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,940
No, no.

2277
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:10,940
This is good.

2278
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:11,940
I don't want to do it.

2279
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:12,940
You don't want to do it?

2280
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:13,940
Please do it.

2281
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:17,940
Is it comfortable?

2282
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,940
Yes, it is.

2283
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:20,940
I wonder if you can do it.

2284
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:26,940
Amazing.

2285
02:19:56,940 --> 02:20:01,940
This is the attraction of Kura.

2286
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:03,940
Excuse me.

2287
02:20:03,940 --> 02:20:04,940
It was already out.

2288
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,940
It was already out.

2289
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:06,940
I didn't wear it.

2290
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:08,940
Excuse me.

2291
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:10,940
Excuse me.

2292
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:18,940
Do you feel good?

2293
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:20,940
I feel good.

2294
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:22,940
It's amazing.

2295
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:29,940
It's sparkling.

2296
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:01,940
It's cold.

2297
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:03,940
It's cold.

2298
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:05,940
It's cold.

2299
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:09,940
It's getting harder.

2300
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:13,940
It's so cold.

2301
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:15,940
It's cold.

2302
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:17,940
Everyone is watching.

2303
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:19,940
It's the last one.

2304
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:21,940
Everyone is watching.

2305
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:25,940
No!

2306
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:27,940
Don't go.

2307
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:29,940
Thank you for your hard work!

2308
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:31,940
Please look forward to it!

2309
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:39,940
Welcome!

2310
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:41,940
This is Ashikoki Zone!

2311
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:43,940
Take out one of these!

2312
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:45,940
Take out one of these!

2313
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:47,940
Are you standing up?

2314
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:49,940
I'm standing up.

2315
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:52,940
You're good.

2316
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:54,940
Really?

2317
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:55,940
Your legs are good.

2318
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:58,940
Look, there are girls around us.

2319
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:01,940
It's the first time.

2320
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:02,940
It's the first time.

2321
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:03,940
It's the first time.

2322
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:10,940
It's amazing.

2323
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:14,940
It feels good.

2324
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:17,940
Can you go up a little?

2325
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:19,940
Are you okay?

2326
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:20,940
It's so hot.

2327
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:27,940
It's so hot.

2328
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:39,940
It's hard, isn't it?

2329
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:41,940
Because it feels good.

2330
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:42,940
Does it feel good?

2331
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:43,940
Yes.

2332
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:45,940
I'm going to do it again.

2333
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:53,940
Oh, it's over.

2334
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:57,940
It's dangerous.

2335
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:01,940
Thank you. See you.

2336
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:05,940
Bye-bye.

2337
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:07,940
Let's do it again.

2338
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:08,940
Okay.

2339
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:10,940
One, two, three, four.

2340
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:11,940
This is...

2341
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:12,940
Oh, sorry.

2342
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:13,940
One more time.

2343
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:14,940
One more time.

2344
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:16,940
One, two, three, four.

2345
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:19,940
This is Tera's attraction.

2346
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:21,940
Nice to meet you.

2347
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:22,940
Yay.

2348
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:23,940
Yay.

2349
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:24,940
Yay.

2350
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:25,940
Yay.

2351
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:26,940
Yay.

2352
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:28,940
Stand up.

2353
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:29,940
Stand up.

2354
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:30,940
Can I sit down?

2355
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:31,940
You can stand up.

2356
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:32,940
Excuse me.

2357
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,940
Excuse me.

2358
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:34,940
Okay.

2359
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:36,940
Can I take a picture with you?

2360
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,940
Yes, please.

2361
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:44,940
Wow!

2362
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:52,940
Wow! It seems to melt.

2363
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:54,940
It feels good.

2364
02:23:56,940 --> 02:23:58,940
It feels good.

2365
02:23:58,940 --> 02:24:00,940
It's so nice.

2366
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:06,940
It's amazing.

2367
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:09,940
It feels so good.

2368
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:24,940
It feels so good.

2369
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:26,940
Thank you very much.

2370
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,940
Thank you.

2371
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:30,940
Thank you very much.

2372
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:32,940
Thank you.

2373
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:34,940
Thank you.

2374
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:36,940
Wow.

2375
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:38,940
Wow.

2376
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:40,940
They are watching us.

2377
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,940
Thank you.

2378
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:44,940
Wow.

2379
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:46,940
Wow.

2380
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:48,940
This is great.

2381
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:50,940
This is great.

2382
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:52,940
This is great.

2383
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:57,940
If you think your ankle is bad, it's even worse.

2384
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:00,940
It's worse than your ankle.

2385
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:01,940
How do you feel?

2386
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:02,940
My ankle is terrible.

2387
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:04,940
Your ankle is terrible, too.

2388
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:05,940
It's getting bigger.

2389
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:07,940
It's even worse.

2390
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:09,940
Is there something in your ankle?

2391
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:11,940
It's terrible.

2392
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:13,940
I moved a lot.

2393
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:15,940
It's very slippery.

2394
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:19,940
It's amazing.

2395
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:20,940
It's amazing.

2396
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:24,940
It's amazing.

2397
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,940
It looks like it's going in.

2398
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:34,940
It feels good.

2399
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:38,940
It's erotic.

2400
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:40,940
It's erotic.

2401
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:43,940
It looks like it's going in.

2402
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:45,940
It's going in?

2403
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:47,940
It's going in.

2404
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:48,940
Let's do it one more time.

2405
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:49,940
Let's do it one more time.

2406
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:54,940
Amazing.

2407
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:57,940
Amazing.

2408
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:00,940
Her expression is a bit...

2409
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:16,260
The

2410
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:18,260
It came out!

2411
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:20,260
Nuru Nuru Sumata is the best!

2412
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:22,260
It came out!

2413
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:24,260
Thank you very much!

2414
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:26,260
I can't stand it!

2415
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:28,260
I want Sumata too!

2416
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:32,260
I want Sumata too!

2417
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:34,260
Excuse me, can I have Sumata too?

2418
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:36,260
Please lie down!

2419
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:42,260
Please!

2420
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:44,260
Please!

2421
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:46,260
I'm going to do it.

2422
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:48,260
I'm scared.

2423
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:50,260
Can I do it?

2424
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:52,260
Excuse me.

2425
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:54,260
I'm Riku Minato.

2426
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:56,260
It's my first time.

2427
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:58,260
Excuse me.

2428
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:00,260
I'm a beginner.

2429
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:02,260
Excuse me.

2430
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:04,260
Please put this on your head.

2431
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:06,260
Thank you.

2432
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:08,260
I'm a beginner.

2433
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:10,260
I'm looking forward to it.

2434
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:13,260
What should I do?

2435
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:16,260
Apply it on your face.

2436
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:18,260
Make it smooth.

2437
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:20,260
Make it smooth.

2438
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:22,260
It's pretty cold.

2439
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:24,260
Apply it.

2440
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:26,260
Wow.

2441
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:28,260
It's a little small.

2442
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:30,260
It's okay.

2443
02:27:30,260 --> 02:27:32,260
It's just a little bit.

2444
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,260
Here we go.

2445
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:36,260
Wow.

2446
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:38,260
Do you use this?

2447
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:40,260
This is the first time I've ever felt this.

2448
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:42,260
This is amazing!

2449
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:44,260
Can I try?

2450
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:48,260
Can I try?

2451
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:50,260
She's being carried away.

2452
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:52,260
Amazing.

2453
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:54,260
She's standing.

2454
02:27:54,260 --> 02:27:56,260
Does it feel good?

2455
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:58,260
I feel like I'm going to die.

2456
02:27:58,260 --> 02:28:00,260
I feel like I'm going to die.

2457
02:28:00,260 --> 02:28:02,260
Not yet.

2458
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:04,260
Not yet.

2459
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:06,260
Not yet.

2460
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:09,260
What are you doing?

2461
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:16,260
What are you doing?

2462
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:25,260
This is the area of request.

2463
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:27,260
What do you want me to do?

2464
02:28:27,260 --> 02:28:28,260
Kiss.

2465
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:29,260
Please.

2466
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:31,260
Thank you for your hard work.

2467
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,260
It's delicious.

2468
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:35,260
It's delicious.

2469
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:37,260
It feels good.

2470
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:41,260
Everyone is hungry.

2471
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,260
Everyone is here for the last time.

2472
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:18,260
Can I hug you?

2473
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:21,260
Can I hug you?

2474
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:28,260
What about you, Chin-chin?

2475
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:32,260
Chin-chin, don't go!

2476
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:35,260
Chin-chin is...

2477
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:37,260
I'm sorry.

2478
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:42,260
If that's the case, I'll drink Abeno mink and have a match with Renze.

2479
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:45,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2480
02:29:56,260 --> 02:29:58,260
I should have done it with Renze.

2481
02:29:58,260 --> 02:29:59,260
I should have done it with Renze.

2482
02:29:59,260 --> 02:30:03,260
That's all for Bakobasso Ero Jungle!

2483
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:19,260
Next, I would like to ask you to explain the next attraction.

2484
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:25,260
Is this a bridge?

2485
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:30,260
You look like you don't have confidence in yourself.

2486
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:32,260
Thank you.

2487
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:34,260
You look like you don't have confidence in yourself.

2488
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:35,260
Go ahead.

2489
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:38,260
I think it's good to decide randomly.

2490
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:39,260
I'm sorry.

2491
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:40,260
Go ahead.

2492
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:45,260
Please raise your voice.

2493
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:47,260
It's decided.

2494
02:30:48,260 --> 02:30:49,260
What's your name?

2495
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:53,260
My name is Fururugi Mikan.

2496
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:55,960
What kind of fruit do you like?

2497
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,960
I like oranges.

2498
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:02,460
I'll give you a hint of the most famous company in Japan.

2499
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:05,460
Please explain it to me.

2500
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:09,460
The script is in the middle.

2501
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:18,960
I will explain the second attraction.

2502
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:22,960
Next, Bakobako Merry-Go-Land!

2503
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:35,960
First, a woman will sit on the M-shape with a rotor.

2504
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:40,960
Then, a man will draw a lottery and decide the order.

2505
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,960
One person will draw one rotor.

2506
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:49,960
The person who draws the lottery can taste the Bako Bako Merry-Go-Land.

2507
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:57,960
Everyone.

2508
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:04,960
Everyone, please open the middle.

2509
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:05,960
Please open it.

2510
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:07,960
What is that?

2511
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:11,960
I didn't notice it at all.

2512
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:13,960
What is it?

2513
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:15,960
What is it?

2514
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:17,960
What is it?

2515
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:19,960
Please open it!

2516
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:24,960
What is it?

2517
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,960
What is it?

2518
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:28,960
What is it?

2519
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,960
I've never seen it. What is it?

2520
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:32,960
What does it mean?

2521
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:38,960
The two men will sit down and do something erotic from everyone.

2522
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:41,960
Let's start the stand-by!

2523
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:40,960
I'm the only one who can do it.

2524
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:43,960
Then, the first person, please come on.

2525
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:49,960
You can choose the color you like.

2526
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:51,960
You can choose the color you like.

2527
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:52,960
What does it mean?

2528
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:54,960
You can choose the color until the end.

2529
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,960
If this is the last one, I'll be sad.

2530
02:33:57,960 --> 02:33:59,960
No, I'm sad.

2531
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:01,960
You can choose the color you like.

2532
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:05,960
The face is a little serious, isn't it?

2533
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:12,960
I don't know if it's on the surface.

2534
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:15,960
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2535
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:20,960
What is the point of smiling when you look at this?

2536
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:22,960
It feels good.

2537
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:25,960
What are you looking at?

2538
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:27,960
What are you looking at?

2539
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,960
What color?

2540
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:31,960
What color is it?

2541
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:33,960
What color is it?

2542
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:35,960
It's cool.

2543
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:37,960
Is it okay to do it like this?

2544
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:39,960
Yes.

2545
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:41,960
Please take off your clothes.

2546
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:43,960
In the end, it doesn't move.

2547
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:47,960
In the end, it doesn't move.

2548
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:49,960
Please be kind to me.

2549
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:51,960
Please be kind to me.

2550
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,960
Oh, it came out.

2551
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:55,960
Oh, that's too bad.

2552
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:57,960
Come on!

2553
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:59,960
Come on!

2554
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:01,960
Come on!

2555
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:03,960
Who is the winner?

2556
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:05,960
Who is the winner?

2557
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:07,960
You don't choose by your preference, do you?

2558
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:09,960
That's right.

2559
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,960
Please draw.

2560
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,960
Oh, it's a pity.

2561
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:15,960
Come on!

2562
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:21,960
It's over.

2563
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:22,960
Let's go.

2564
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:29,960
Oh, too bad.

2565
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:31,960
Too bad.

2566
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:32,960
Too bad.

2567
02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:33,960
No.4, please.

2568
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:36,960
Are you crying?

2569
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,960
Please take your time.

2570
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:47,960
Oh, I'm going to be born.

2571
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:50,960
Too bad.

2572
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:52,960
Please choose one of the five.

2573
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,960
The fifth is Cherry Boy.

2574
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:56,960
He is still Cherry Boy.

2575
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:02,960
Please choose one of the five.

2576
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,960
What's wrong? It's embarrassing.

2577
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:06,960
Look closely.

2578
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,960
Look at his face.

2579
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,960
I want a manko.

2580
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:20,960
How is it?

2581
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:23,960
Is there something in it?

2582
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:24,960
No.

2583
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,960
Too bad.

2584
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:26,960
Thank you.

2585
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:28,960
Here you are.

2586
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,960
Please record it.

2587
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:32,960
No one is looking at it.

2588
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:34,960
This.

2589
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:36,960
This one.

2590
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:38,960
Wait.

2591
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:40,960
It's coming out.

2592
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,960
Okay, go straight.

2593
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:44,960
Slowly.

2594
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:50,960
You can't send it.

2595
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:52,960
Why?

2596
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:54,960
Why?

2597
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:56,960
Just the rotor isn't enough.

2598
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,960
That's too bad.

2599
02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:00,960
Go back there.

2600
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:03,960
Number 3, number 7, and number 6.

2601
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:05,960
I can't put anything in.

2602
02:37:05,960 --> 02:37:07,960
Look carefully.

2603
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:09,960
Look carefully.

2604
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:10,960
I put it in.

2605
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:12,960
Excuse me.

2606
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,960
I think it's going in.

2607
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,960
Come on, come on, come on.

2608
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:18,960
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

2609
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:20,960
Too bad.

2610
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:23,960
Too bad.

2611
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:24,960
It's terrible.

2612
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:25,960
Look carefully.

2613
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:28,960
Look at Manco's face.

2614
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,960
I'm going in.

2615
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:32,960
It's a funny game, isn't it?

2616
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:34,960
Yes, yes, yes.

2617
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:36,960
How is it?

2618
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:38,960
Good?

2619
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,960
I don't know.

2620
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:42,960
Slowly.

2621
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:44,960
How is it?

2622
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,960
It's a pity.

2623
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:48,960
Here is your souvenir.

2624
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,960
Here you are.

2625
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:52,960
Oh, there's more.

2626
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:03,960
Wow, look at that.

2627
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:05,960
You're so good at this.

2628
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:08,960
Amazing, right?

2629
02:38:13,960 --> 02:38:14,960
Oh, you came this way?

2630
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:16,960
Okay, sleep well.

2631
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:17,960
Sleep well.

2632
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:19,960
How is it?

2633
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:21,960
How is it?

2634
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:23,960
You got it!

2635
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:35,960
You got 5 points!

2636
02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:37,960
Thank you!

2637
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:41,960
I think you guys can do it because of the mat.

2638
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:43,960
Can you?

2639
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:45,960
Thank you!

2640
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:47,960
Congratulations!

2641
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:49,960
Congratulations!

2642
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:51,960
Congratulations!

2643
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:53,960
After this, it's reward time!

2644
02:38:53,960 --> 02:38:57,960
So everyone, Bako Bako Merry-Go-Land

2645
02:38:57,960 --> 02:38:59,960
Let's start the song!

2646
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:01,960
Let's start!

2647
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:07,960
Are you ready?

2648
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:09,960
Let's do it one more time.

2649
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:14,960
Let's do it one more time.

2650
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:18,960
Let's do it one more time.

2651
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,960
Ready, go!

2652
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:26,960
It's coming out!

2653
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:28,960
It's coming out.

2654
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:30,960
It's amazing.

2655
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:34,960
It's coming out.

2656
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:36,960
I'm sorry.

2657
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:47,960
Now I'm going to eat the anus.

2658
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:49,960
It's fast.

2659
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:51,960
Riku, put it in.

2660
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:52,960
Can I?

2661
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:53,960
But I have lotion.

2662
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:54,960
It's okay.

2663
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:55,960
I'll do it with my fangs.

2664
02:39:57,960 --> 02:39:58,960
Wow.

2665
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,960
It's crunchy.

2666
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:01,960
It's crunchy.

2667
02:40:01,960 --> 02:40:03,960
I want to see it.

2668
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:05,960
I want to see it.

2669
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:07,960
Do you want to see the butt?

2670
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:09,960
I want to see it.

2671
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:11,960
Ready, set, go!

2672
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:13,960
Wow!

2673
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:15,960
Wow!

2674
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:17,960
Wow!

2675
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:19,960
Wow!

2676
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:23,960
I'm so excited.

2677
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:25,960
I'm so excited.

2678
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:27,960
I'm so excited.

2679
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:29,960
Wow!

2680
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:31,960
I want to do it.

2681
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:33,960
Have you developed your butt?

2682
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:35,960
No, I haven't.

2683
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:37,960
Do you want to do it?

2684
02:40:37,960 --> 02:40:39,960
Yes, I want to do it.

2685
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:43,960
Are you going to do it?

2686
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:45,960
Yes, I'm going to do it.

2687
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:49,960
You are good.

2688
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:53,960
Please be kind to her.

2689
02:40:53,960 --> 02:40:55,960
She is a girl.

2690
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:57,960
That's right.

2691
02:40:57,960 --> 02:41:01,960
First of all, I'm going to take it off.

2692
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:04,960
Wow!

2693
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:07,960
It became a hole.

2694
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:10,960
It fell down.

2695
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,960
Wow! It fell down!

2696
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,960
Do you want me to stab it?

2697
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:16,960
Do you want me to stab it?

2698
02:41:16,960 --> 02:41:18,960
Do you want me to stab your nose?

2699
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,960
Do you want me to stab it?

2700
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:22,960
It's cute.

2701
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:25,960
It's amazing.

2702
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:27,960
It's cute, isn't it?

2703
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:29,960
It's cute, isn't it?

2704
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:31,960
No, it's not.

2705
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:35,960
Oh, it's going!

2706
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:37,960
It's going!

2707
02:41:37,960 --> 02:41:39,960
It's going in!

2708
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:41,960
Relax.

2709
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:43,960
Take a deep breath.

2710
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:45,960
How do you feel?

2711
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:47,960
I like the way it comes out.

2712
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:49,960
I like the way it comes out.

2713
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:53,960
It's so cute!

2714
02:41:53,960 --> 02:41:56,960
Wow! It's J.K.Members!

2715
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,960
Amazing!

2716
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:00,960
I want to make a hole in it.

2717
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:02,960
The whole thing is in it.

2718
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:04,960
It's in it.

2719
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:06,960
There's a finger in it!

2720
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:08,960
Wow!

2721
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:10,960
Can I draw a flower for you?

2722
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:12,960
That's right.

2723
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:14,960
Let me draw it.

2724
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:16,960
Let me draw it.

2725
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,960
Amazing!

2726
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:20,960
There's a lot in it.

2727
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:23,960
I'm so embarrassed.

2728
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:25,960
I'm so embarrassed.

2729
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:30,960
So cute.

2730
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:39,960
She's going in.

2731
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:42,960
Her nose is coming out of her butt.

2732
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:44,960
She's going in.

2733
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:46,960
It's a flower!

2734
02:42:46,960 --> 02:42:48,960
Wow!

2735
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:50,960
So cute!

2736
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:52,960
So cute!

2737
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:54,960
So cute!

2738
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,960
The flower bloomed!

2739
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:58,960
How do you feel about the flower?

2740
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,960
It's a weird feeling.

2741
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:02,960
It's a nice butt hole.

2742
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,960
It's cute!

2743
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:06,960
It's cute!

2744
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:08,960
It's cute!

2745
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,960
It's cute!

2746
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:12,960
Change!

2747
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:16,960
Change! Change! Change! Change! Change!

2748
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:19,960
Wait, my nose is stuck!

2749
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:23,960
Let's make it cuter.

2750
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:26,960
It feels good.

2751
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:28,960
It feels good.

2752
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,960
It's cuter.

2753
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,960
It's so cute.

2754
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:38,960
It's so sticky.

2755
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,960
It's very sticky.

2756
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:44,960
It's full.

2757
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:46,960
It's all over the place.

2758
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:50,960
It's disgusting.

2759
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:52,960
It's disgusting.

2760
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:54,960
It's disgusting.

2761
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:56,960
It's all over the place.

2762
02:43:58,960 --> 02:44:00,960
Is it good?

2763
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:06,960
It looks delicious.

2764
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:08,960
I feel sorry for you.

2765
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:10,960
It's so hard.

2766
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:12,960
It's hard, Binbin.

2767
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:14,960
Yuka, do you feel good?

2768
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:15,960
Yes.

2769
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:17,960
It tastes like Dosukebe.

2770
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:18,960
Really?

2771
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:20,960
What do you want me to do?

2772
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:22,960
I want you to push harder.

2773
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:24,960
You want me to push harder?

2774
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:26,960
I want you to push harder.

2775
02:44:26,960 --> 02:44:28,960
Where?

2776
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,960
Where is the yodo?

2777
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:32,960
Yodo, yodo.

2778
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:34,960
Yodo.

2779
02:44:34,960 --> 02:44:36,960
The second one!

2780
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:38,960
The second one!

2781
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:42,960
It fits perfectly!

2782
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:44,960
It fits perfectly!

2783
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:46,960
The third one!

2784
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:48,960
It fits perfectly!

2785
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:50,960
It fits perfectly!

2786
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:52,960
It fits perfectly!

2787
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:54,960
Your boyfriend is beautiful.

2788
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:56,960
It fits perfectly!

2789
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,960
It fits perfectly!

2790
02:44:58,960 --> 02:45:00,960
Isn't it too big?

2791
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:02,960
Isn't it too big?

2792
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:04,960
I got a half of it!

2793
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:06,960
Wow!

2794
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:08,960
Let's put it down.

2795
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,960
Let's put it down.

2796
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:12,960
It's heavy.

2797
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:14,960
Isn't this a butterfly?

2798
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:16,960
No, it's not.

2799
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,960
Wow!

2800
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:22,960
Doesn't it hurt?

2801
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,960
Does it hurt a little?

2802
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:26,960
I'll give you a good one.

2803
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:28,960
I have to give you a good one.

2804
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,960
Is it okay now?

2805
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:31,960
She is being attacked.

2806
02:45:31,960 --> 02:45:32,960
But I think I can do it.

2807
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:33,960
Let's attack the chinko.

2808
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:35,960
Chinko.

2809
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:36,960
Let's attack the chinko.

2810
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:37,960
You're like a geisha.

2811
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:38,960
Let's attack.

2812
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:41,960
I can't do this.

2813
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:44,960
Chinko Bibi-chan.

2814
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:46,960
Chinko Bibi-chan.

2815
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:47,960
Chinko Bibi-chan.

2816
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:51,960
Chinko Bibi-chan.

2817
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:52,960
I did it.

2818
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:56,960
Who is going to shoot?

2819
02:45:56,960 --> 02:45:59,960
Who's going to take a picture of this?

2820
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:02,960
What is this guy?

2821
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:03,960
It's fashionable.

2822
02:46:03,960 --> 02:46:04,960
What is this?

2823
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:05,960
It's so modern.

2824
02:46:05,960 --> 02:46:06,960
It's so modern.

2825
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:07,960
It's so modern.

2826
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:08,960
Do you want to take a picture?

2827
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:09,960
Yes.

2828
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,960
I got a kiss.

2829
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:12,960
A kiss.

2830
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:13,960
A kiss from Ayu-chan.

2831
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:14,960
This is good.

2832
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:15,960
This feels good.

2833
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:17,960
Ayu-chan, Ayu-chan's kiss.

2834
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:19,960
I'm going to use my nose to attack Chikubi.

2835
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:20,960
This is amazing.

2836
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:24,960
I got a kiss.

2837
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:25,960
Ayu-chan's Chikubi.

2838
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:26,960
How do you feel?

2839
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:28,960
It's been a long time since I've been here.

2840
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:29,960
Wow!

2841
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:32,960
How do you feel, Seiko?

2842
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:33,960
I feel good.

2843

I feel good.

2845
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:36,960
Nice to meet you.

2846
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:37,960
Nice to meet you.

2847
02:46:39,960 --> 02:46:40,960
Wow!

2848
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:41,960
Wow, baby!

2849
02:46:41,960 --> 02:46:42,960
Wow, wow!

2850
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:43,960
Wow!

It's so cute.

02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:04,960
Everyone, please look at different places.

2858
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:08,960
Let's take a picture.

2859
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,960
Let's go.

2860
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:14,960
How is it?

2861
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:16,960
Chiko, you can take a picture.

2862
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:17,960
Do you feel good?

2863
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:37,960
Do you feel good?

2864
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:38,960
I feel good.

2865
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:42,960
You are being petted in various places.

2866
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:44,960
I want to pet it.

2867
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:46,960
You are amazing.

2868
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:48,960
I can't pet it.

2869
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:50,960
You are amazing.

2870
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:02,960
I want to pet it.

2871

This?

2875
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:12,960
He wants you to pet him.

2876
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:15,960
He's so naughty.

2877
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:18,960
He's so cute.

2878
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:21,960
Which part do you like?

2879

Various parts.

2880
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:37,960
Teacher, you're doing great.

2881
02:48:37,960 --> 02:48:39,960
Wow, it's so clear!

2882
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:44,960
Is it about to come out?

2883
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:45,960
It's so clear!

2884
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:47,960
You can put it out one more time!

2885
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:51,960
Put it out a lot!

2886
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:53,960
Everyone is watching.

2887
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:54,960
I'm so hungry.

2888
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:05,960
I wonder if they're really hungry.

2889
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:18,960
Which one do you like? The strong one?

2890
02:49:19,960 --> 02:49:20,960
I like it.

2891
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:22,960
Oh my!

02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:33,960
Let's go!

2894
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:35,960
One, two, one, two, one, two!

2895
02:49:35,960 --> 02:49:37,960
One, two, one, two!

2896
02:49:45,960 --> 02:49:47,960
Oh my, there are so many of them!

2897
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:49,960
I saw it.

2898
02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:51,960
Look at it.

2899
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:53,960
How did it fly?

2900
02:49:53,960 --> 02:49:55,960
Wow!

2901
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:57,960

02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:05,960
It's amazing.

2906
02:50:05,960 --> 02:50:07,960
Look at it.

2907
02:50:07,960 --> 02:50:09,960
It's amazing.

2908
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:11,960
I want to eat it too!

2909
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:18,960
Michi drank it!

2910
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:21,960
Come on!

2911
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:23,960
I want to eat it too!

2912
02:50:25,960 --> 02:50:27,960
I want to eat it too!

2913
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:29,960
I want to eat it too!

2914
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:33,960
I want to eat it too!

2915
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:35,960
Thank you very much!

2916
02:50:35,960 --> 02:50:37,960
Congratulations!

2917
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:42,960
That was MakoBus and MakoBus!

2918
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:22,120
The correct answer is 95% of the answers, so it's embarrassing if you get it wrong.

2919
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:24,320
I'll explain it to you.

2920
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:27,840
You have to listen to the notice.

2921
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:29,680
You won't say it again.

2922
02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:47,680
The rule is to guess the order of the girls who are blindfolded and the boys who are shuffled without the blindfold.

2923
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:49,680
Do you understand?

2924
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:51,680
Yes.

2925
02:51:51,680 --> 02:52:00,680
The team with the highest number of correct answers will receive an expensive present!

2926
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:05,680
Thank you!

2927
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:10,680
Everyone, please close your eyes!

2928
02:52:14,680 --> 02:52:16,680
What is this game?

2929
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:21,680
I can't see you.

2930
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:24,680
If you can see me, I'll punish you.

2931
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:26,680
Really?

2932
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:29,680
I won't do it.

2933
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:37,680
If you can see me, I won't punish you.

2934
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:40,680
I won't punish you.

2935
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:43,680
I won't punish you.

2936
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:49,680
How many do you have?

2937
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:54,680
Help! Help!

2938
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:57,680
Help! Help!

2939
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:00,680
Help! Help!

2940
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:03,680
Ah, the button came out!

2941
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:06,680
Help! Help!

2942
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:08,680
What's going on?

2943
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:10,680
How many people are here?

2944
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:42,680
Let's start the live!

2945
02:53:42,680 --> 02:53:44,680
I got it!

2946
02:53:48,680 --> 02:53:50,680
Wow! I can feel it!

2947
02:53:52,680 --> 02:53:54,680
Ichiban!

2948
02:54:02,680 --> 02:54:04,680
Ichiban's man is here.

2949
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:07,680
It's just me, right?

2950
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:09,680
Don't touch it!

2951
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:15,680
It's red.

2952
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:17,680
When will it come?

2953
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:21,680
Is it coming?

2954
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:23,680
No, it hasn't come yet.

2955
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:33,680
Okay.

2956
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:36,680
It's cold.

2957
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:38,680
It's cold.

2958
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:41,680
The boys will be exposed if they make a sound.

2959
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:43,680
Like U, A, or Z.

2960
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:45,680
I want number 1.

2961
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:47,680
Here we go! Change!

2962
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:50,680
I remember.

2963
02:54:50,680 --> 02:54:52,680
It's the first one.

2964
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:54,680
I think this is the second one.

2965
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:56,680
Where?

2966
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:58,680
I think number 2.

2967
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:01,680
Wait, my hair is really messy.

2968
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:02,680
I see.

2969
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:06,680
This is number 1.

2970
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:08,680
This is number 2.

2971
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:19,680
This is number 2.

2972
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:20,680
Yes.

2973
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:21,680
Number 2.

2974
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:22,680
Let's take it out.

2975
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:24,680
It's so fast!

2976
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:34,680
You're only talking about the first one.

2977
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:46,680
What about the second one?

2978
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:49,680
The second one is...

2979
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:51,680
I think it's warm.

2980
02:55:51,680 --> 02:55:52,680
Warm?

2981
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:54,680
It's warm.

2982
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:06,680
I remember.

2983
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:17,680
It's big.

2984
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:18,680
I can't get in.

2985
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:38,680
Does it feel good?

2986
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:40,680
Can you eat it?

2987
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:44,680
I don't know if it's dry or not.

2988
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:57,680
I think I know what it is.

2989
02:56:57,680 --> 02:56:59,680
I know.

2990
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:01,680
Change!

2991
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:10,680
This is the fourth one.

2992
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:13,680
This is the fourth one.

2993
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:16,680
This is the fourth one.

2994
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:19,680
This is the fourth one.

2995
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:22,680
Do you understand?

2996
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:25,680
You finally understood.

2997
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:28,680
I don't know.

2998
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:30,680
I don't know.

2999
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:34,680
There are 10 members.

3000
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:39,680
Men and women.

3001
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:47,680
Change.

3002
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:49,680
I don't know.

3003
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:51,680
Is this shuffle change?

3004
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:23,680
The second time.

3005
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:25,680
The second time.

3006
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:27,680
The second time.

3007
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:41,680
Don't touch it.

3008
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:43,680
Don't touch it.

3009
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:45,680
Don't touch it.

3010
02:58:45,680 --> 02:58:47,680
You will understand.

3011
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:49,680
Are you nervous?

3012
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:51,680
It's dangerous.

3013
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:53,680
Please wait for a moment.

3014
02:58:55,680 --> 02:58:57,680
Please wait for a moment.

3015
02:58:57,680 --> 02:58:59,680
Please wait for a moment.

3016
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:04,680
I'm the only one.

3017
02:59:04,680 --> 02:59:06,680
Everyone is doing it.

3018
02:59:06,680 --> 02:59:08,680
Everyone is doing it.

3019
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:13,680
Why do you make it?

3020
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:15,680
Change.

3021
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:17,680
Oh, it's hot.

3022
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:24,680
Oh, it's hot.

3023
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:26,680
It's so big.

3024
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:35,680
It's so big.

3025
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:36,680
Change!

3026
02:59:38,680 --> 02:59:39,680
Uwaaah!

3027
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,680
Oh!

3028
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:42,680
Oh!

3029
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:44,680
Oh!

3030
02:59:45,680 --> 02:59:46,680
Oh!

3031
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:48,680
It's going to be forgotten.

3032
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:50,680
It's so big.

3033
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:01,680
Uwaaah!

3034
03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:02,680
It's really big.

3035
03:00:02,680 --> 03:00:03,680
Change!

3036
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:06,680
It's a little more.

3037
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:08,680
It's a little more.

3038
03:00:10,680 --> 03:00:12,680
It's the last one.

3039
03:00:12,680 --> 03:00:14,680
If you shake it,

3040
03:00:14,680 --> 03:00:16,680
You can hit it with the window.

3041
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:19,680
You can hit it if you don't have it.

3042
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:22,680
I think I can understand.

3043
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:24,680
The fourth one is a little longer.

3044
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:26,680
My hands are sticky.

3045
03:00:26,680 --> 03:00:28,680
Do you understand?

3046
03:00:28,680 --> 03:00:30,680
The second one is the smallest.

3047
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:32,680
The third one is probably the second one.

3048
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:33,680
It's probably the second one.

3049
03:00:33,680 --> 03:00:34,680
And the first one is...

3050
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:36,680
But if you forget the rest...

3051
03:00:36,680 --> 03:00:37,680
It's the sixth one.

3052
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:39,680
The sixth one is the third one.

3053
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:41,680
The seventh one.

3054
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,680
The second one is...

3055
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:47,680
I wrote the second one.

3056
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:49,680
What is it?

3057
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:56,680
What is it?

3058
03:00:56,680 --> 03:00:58,680
What is it?

3059
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:00,680
The first step is to make a circle.

3060
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:04,680
Is there any difference?

3061
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:09,680
OK, cut!

3062
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:12,680
Don't take a picture of your eyebrows yet!

3063
03:01:12,680 --> 03:01:14,680
This is the end, but you still have to take a picture of your eyebrows.

3064
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:16,680
You can't take a picture of your eyebrows.

3065
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:20,680
Please circle the male and put it in front of the female.

3066
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:21,680
Yes, yes.

3067
03:01:21,680 --> 03:01:22,680
Please wear a scarf.

3068
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:24,680
Please wear a scarf.

3069
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:26,680
Please wear a scarf.

3070
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:27,680
I don't know.

3071
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:28,680
I don't know.

3072
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:30,680
What should I do?

3073
03:01:30,680 --> 03:01:31,680
I think so.

3074
03:01:32,680 --> 03:01:33,680
What?

3075
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:34,680
Hey.

3076
03:01:34,680 --> 03:01:35,680
If you do this,

3077
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:36,680
What are you going to do next?

3078
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:37,680
I'm going to trade.

3079
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:38,680
What?

3080
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:40,680
I don't know if I'm going to trade.

3081
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:41,680
Please take a picture.

3082
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:42,680
Yes.

3083
03:01:42,680 --> 03:01:44,680
I'm going to take a picture.

3084
03:01:44,680 --> 03:01:46,680
Please take a picture.

3085
03:01:46,680 --> 03:01:47,680
Yes.

3086
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:48,680
Yes.

3087
03:01:48,680 --> 03:01:49,680
It's bright.

3088
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:51,680
It's fun!

3089
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:54,680
Please get used to it.

3090
03:01:55,680 --> 03:01:57,680
I don't know.

3091
03:01:58,680 --> 03:02:00,680
A man is already playing shuffle.

3092
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:10,680
Let's start.

3093
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:16,680
Fela-chin time start!

3094
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:18,680
Thank you very much.

3095
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:20,680
Everyone, please pay.

3096
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:22,680
Thank you very much.

3097
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:26,680
Please pay in the direction of delivery.

3098
03:02:26,680 --> 03:02:30,680
Then, please go in that direction.

3099
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:50,680
I got it.

3100
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:53,680
I got it.

3101
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:55,680
I got it.

3102
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:57,680
I got it.

3103
03:02:57,680 --> 03:02:59,680
I got it.

3104
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:03,680
You don't listen to the instructions.

3105
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:05,680
You don't listen to the instructions.

3106
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:09,680
I got it.

3107
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:13,680
Let's clean up.

3108
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:15,680
Let's vote.

3109
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:19,680
Let's vote.

3110
03:03:21,680 --> 03:03:23,680
What is it?

3111
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:27,680
It's nothing.

3112
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:30,680
Here you are.

3113
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:32,680
Is it like this?

3114
03:03:32,680 --> 03:03:34,680
Is it like this?

3115
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:36,680
But I can see it.

3116
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:38,680
Is it like this?

3117
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:40,680
It's like this.

3118
03:03:40,680 --> 03:03:42,680
No.1

3119
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,680
No.1?

3120
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:45,680
I see

3121
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:48,680
No way

3122
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:49,680
No.1 photo

3123
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:52,680
No.3 photo

3124
03:03:52,680 --> 03:03:53,680
What?

3125
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:54,680
Really?

3126
03:03:54,680 --> 03:03:55,680
No.1 photo

3127
03:03:57,680 --> 03:03:58,680
Really?

3128
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:00,680
No way

3129
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:02,680
Really?

3130
03:04:02,680 --> 03:04:03,680
No.4 photo

3131
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:04,680
No.4 photo

3132
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:06,680
Mine is No.2 photo

3133
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:10,680
Can I put it in?

3134
03:04:10,680 --> 03:04:11,680
I think it's definitely number 4.

3135
03:04:11,680 --> 03:04:13,680
Can I put it in?

3136
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:14,680
I got it.

3137
03:04:18,680 --> 03:04:20,680
Can I put it in?

3138
03:04:20,680 --> 03:04:23,680
I'll put it in.

3139
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:25,680
Are you okay?

3140
03:04:28,680 --> 03:04:30,680
I'm okay.

3141
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:32,680
My legs are sore.

3142
03:04:46,680 --> 03:04:48,680
My legs are sore.

3143
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:57,680
My legs are sore.

3144
03:04:57,680 --> 03:04:58,680
Let's go inside.

3145
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:04,680
Look at the entrance.

3146
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:12,680
It's open.

3147
03:05:12,680 --> 03:05:14,680
Let's go, Shin-chan.

3148
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:25,680
It's so big!

3149
03:05:25,680 --> 03:05:30,680
Wow, it's huge!

3150
03:05:30,680 --> 03:05:32,680
I can't do it anymore.

3151
03:05:53,680 --> 03:05:55,680
It's so big.

3152
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:57,680
I don't think I can do it alone.

3153
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:09,680
Which one is the best?

3154
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:17,680
Everyone said number 4.

3155
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:19,680
Definitely number 4.

3156
03:06:19,680 --> 03:06:26,680
I think the difference between number 1 and number 2 is that number 2 is a little thicker.

3157
03:06:26,680 --> 03:06:28,680
Huh? You didn't notice?

3158
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:31,680
I couldn't reach the bottom.

3159
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:33,680
Number 2.

3160
03:06:33,680 --> 03:06:36,680
So I think number 2 is...

3161
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:38,680
Do you want to exchange?

3162
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:39,680
I do.

3163
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:40,680
That's suspicious.

3164
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:41,680
Number 2.

3165
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:42,680
This is number 1?

3166
03:06:42,680 --> 03:06:45,680
I think it's probably number 1, but I don't know if it's number 2.

3167
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:47,680
But the amount of hair is number 1.

3168
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:48,680
I don't know.

3169
03:06:50,680 --> 03:06:51,680
You got it, didn't you?

3170
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:53,680
You got it, didn't you?

3171
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:12,680
How many do you want?

3172
03:07:42,680 --> 03:07:45,680
It came out.

3173
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:47,680
What should I do?

3174
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:48,680
It came out.

3175
03:07:48,680 --> 03:07:50,680
What number is it?

3176
03:07:56,680 --> 03:07:58,680
It was number 4.

3177
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:04,680
It was number 4.

3178
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:06,680
Number 4.

3179
03:08:06,680 --> 03:08:08,680
It was number 4.

3180
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:09,680
Number 1.

3181
03:08:09,680 --> 03:08:10,680
Number 1?

3182
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:12,680
4, 2, 1

3183
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:14,680
4, 2, 3

3184
03:08:14,680 --> 03:08:15,680
3?

3185
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:17,680
I'm sure it's number 4

3186
03:08:17,680 --> 03:08:19,680
Do you like Chikume too?

3187
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:21,680
Number 3?

3188
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:22,680
Do you like Chikume too?

3189
03:08:22,680 --> 03:08:23,680
Are you sleeping?

3190
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:25,680
I'm not sleeping

3191
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,680
It's out

3192
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:27,680
OK, OK

3193
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:29,680
I'm not sleeping

3194
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:32,680
Are you OK?

3195
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:33,680
Yeah

3196
03:08:33,680 --> 03:08:35,680
You look like you're going to fall

3197
03:08:35,680 --> 03:08:36,680
I feel good.

3198
03:08:36,680 --> 03:08:37,680
What?

3199
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:42,680
What?

3200
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:44,680
Wait.

3201
03:08:44,680 --> 03:08:45,680
That's...

3202
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:46,680
That's right.

3203
03:08:46,680 --> 03:08:47,680
What?

3204
03:08:48,680 --> 03:08:52,680
I got the same score as you.

3205
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:55,680
Please continue.

3206
03:08:56,680 --> 03:08:58,680
This face.

3207
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:04,680
I thought it was okay because you looked like you were in pain.

3208
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:09,680
It was my first time, so I felt really good.

3209
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:11,680
How was it?

3210
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:13,680
Do you feel good?

3211
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:15,680
Keep going.

3212
03:09:15,680 --> 03:09:18,680
You'll probably never forget it.

3213
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:20,680
Wow!

3214
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:22,680
You'll remember this face.

3215
03:09:22,680 --> 03:09:24,680
Right?

3216
03:09:24,680 --> 03:09:26,680
You'll remember it.

3217
03:09:28,680 --> 03:09:30,680
How was it?

3218
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:32,680
Are you feeling good?

3219
03:09:32,680 --> 03:09:34,680
It was amazing.

3220
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:36,680
It was a good memory, wasn't it?

3221
03:09:36,680 --> 03:09:38,680
It was captured on VTR.

3222
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:40,680
Look, it's in there.

3223
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:42,680
Can't I show my face?

3224
03:09:42,680 --> 03:09:44,680
You don't have to see it.

3225
03:09:44,680 --> 03:09:46,680
How do you feel?

3226
03:09:46,680 --> 03:09:48,680
I feel good.

3227
03:09:48,680 --> 03:09:50,680
I feel good too.

3228
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:52,680
No, is this a game I'm playing?

3229
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:54,680
It's okay.

3230
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:56,680
Is it okay?

3231
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:58,680
It's okay.

3232
03:09:58,680 --> 03:10:00,680
3 minutes left.

3233
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:02,680
You can write it in 3 minutes.

3234
03:10:02,680 --> 03:10:04,680
3 minutes left.

3235
03:10:04,680 --> 03:10:08,680
You can't write it like that.

3236
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:11,680
I don't know.

3237
03:10:21,680 --> 03:10:24,680
I think it's number 2.

3238
03:10:24,680 --> 03:10:26,680
What?

3239
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:29,680
This is number 1.

3240
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:31,680
Wait a minute.

3241
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:34,680
It feels good.

3242
03:10:34,680 --> 03:10:37,680
Wait a minute.

3243
03:10:37,680 --> 03:10:38,680
I'm so tired.

3244
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:53,680
Wait a minute, I'm already sweating.

3245
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:57,680
Isn't it number 1?

3246
03:10:57,680 --> 03:10:58,680
Isn't it?

3247
03:10:58,680 --> 03:11:00,680
I think it's number 1.

3248
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:02,680
Number 4.

3249
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:04,680
Number 4, number 4.

3250
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,680
What is it?

3251
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:08,680
What is it?

3252
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:10,680
A foot?

3253
03:11:10,680 --> 03:11:12,680
A foot?

3254
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:14,680
Is it a foot?

3255
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:16,680
I see

3256
03:11:16,680 --> 03:11:18,680
He's going to poop

3257
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:20,680
He's going to poop

3258
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:22,680
You're going to poop?

3259
03:11:22,680 --> 03:11:24,680
You're going to poop?

3260
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:26,680
He's going to poop

3261
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:28,680
Yes, he's going to poop

3262
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:30,680
I can't

3263
03:11:30,680 --> 03:11:32,680
I can't

3264
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:04,180
She said it.

3265
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:06,180
It's hidden.

3266
03:12:07,180 --> 03:12:08,680
She said it.

3267
03:12:09,180 --> 03:12:10,180
She said it.

3268
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:11,680
She said it.

3269
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:13,180
She said it.

3270
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:15,180
Everyone said it.

3271
03:12:15,180 --> 03:12:16,680
She said this.

3272
03:12:18,180 --> 03:12:20,180
Please don't say that.

3273
03:12:24,180 --> 03:12:25,180
She said it.

3274
03:12:25,180 --> 03:12:26,680
Say it.

3275
03:12:27,180 --> 03:12:28,680
She said it.

3276
03:12:28,680 --> 03:12:31,180
Please don't say that.

3277
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:33,180
It's Yura!

3278
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:35,180
It came out!

3279
03:12:35,180 --> 03:12:37,180
Amazing!

3280
03:12:37,180 --> 03:12:39,180
This is your first time, isn't it?

3281
03:12:45,180 --> 03:12:47,180
I won't say it.

3282
03:12:49,180 --> 03:12:51,180
Everyone, 30 seconds left!

3283
03:12:51,180 --> 03:12:53,180
30 seconds left!

3284
03:12:53,180 --> 03:12:55,180
It came out!

3285
03:12:55,180 --> 03:12:57,180
Are you okay?

3286
03:12:57,180 --> 03:12:59,180
It was comfortable.

3287
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:02,180
Don't make fun of me.

3288
03:13:15,180 --> 03:13:17,180
1st place, right?

3289
03:13:17,180 --> 03:13:20,180
10 seconds left.

3290
03:13:20,180 --> 03:13:22,180
1st place.

3291
03:13:22,180 --> 03:13:25,180
2nd place?

3292
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:27,180
Really?

3293
03:13:55,180 --> 03:13:57,180
It's amazing.

3294
03:13:57,180 --> 03:13:59,180
Look at this.

3295
03:13:59,180 --> 03:14:01,180
I'm going.

3296
03:14:01,180 --> 03:14:03,180
Everyone is going.

3297
03:14:03,180 --> 03:14:05,180
Everyone is going here?

3298
03:14:05,180 --> 03:14:09,180
Mr.Dote graduated.

3299
03:14:09,180 --> 03:14:11,180
It's a graduation.

3300
03:14:11,180 --> 03:14:13,180
But it's a little half, isn't it?

3301
03:14:15,180 --> 03:14:17,180
It's about Dote now.

3302
03:14:17,180 --> 03:14:19,180
Next.

3303
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:24,180
OK, everyone, let's do a thinking time.

3304
03:14:24,180 --> 03:14:25,180
OK.

3305
03:14:25,180 --> 03:14:27,180
Ishikawa, a man shouldn't get up yet.

3306
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:29,180
You can see it.

3307
03:14:29,180 --> 03:14:31,180
OK, let's do it.

3308
03:14:31,180 --> 03:14:33,180
Thinking time.

3309
03:14:35,180 --> 03:14:37,180
Think about it.

3310
03:14:37,180 --> 03:14:39,180
Think about it.

3311
03:14:39,180 --> 03:14:41,180
Think about it.

3312
03:14:41,180 --> 03:14:43,180
Which one?

3313
03:14:43,180 --> 03:14:45,180
Which one?

3314
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:46,180
Shall we say it together?

3315
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:48,180
Ready, set, go!

3316
03:14:48,180 --> 03:14:49,180
No worries!

3317
03:14:50,180 --> 03:14:52,180
Can we get the number plate?

3318
03:14:52,180 --> 03:14:54,180
Then, number 3!

3319
03:15:02,180 --> 03:15:03,180
What?

3320
03:15:03,180 --> 03:15:04,180
Can we get the number plate?

3321
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:05,180
The number plate?

3322
03:15:05,180 --> 03:15:06,180
Yeah

3323
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:08,180
3

3324
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:11,180
1

3325
03:15:11,180 --> 03:15:12,180
2

3326
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:13,180
Let's write it down

3327
03:16:13,180 --> 03:16:15,180
I wonder if it's number 3.

3328
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:17,180
That's correct.

3329
03:16:17,180 --> 03:16:19,180
This person is number 1.

3330
03:16:20,180 --> 03:16:22,180
You got it right.

3331
03:16:23,180 --> 03:16:25,180
If you get it right next time, you're correct.

3332
03:16:25,180 --> 03:16:27,180
This person is number 3.

3333
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:31,180
Congratulations.

3334
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:35,180
Correct.

3335
03:16:37,180 --> 03:16:39,180
Team Tarutsu is correct.

3336
03:16:39,180 --> 03:16:47,180
Let's go to the dog team.

3337
03:16:47,180 --> 03:16:50,180
Dote-kun is No. 4, right?

3338
03:16:50,180 --> 03:16:52,180
Yes, come on.

3339
03:16:57,180 --> 03:17:00,180
This boy is also No. 3, right?

3340
03:17:00,180 --> 03:17:02,180
Yes, come on.

3341
03:17:02,180 --> 03:17:05,180
Yes, correct.

3342
03:17:05,180 --> 03:17:08,900
If this person is No.2, it is correct.

3343
03:17:08,900 --> 03:17:11,500
Team U-san, please go ahead.

3344
03:17:11,500 --> 03:17:15,500
Congratulations!

3345
03:17:15,500 --> 03:17:20,500
Congratulations!

3346
03:17:20,500 --> 03:17:25,500
Congratulations!

3347
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:28,500
Next is the Neko-san team.

3348
03:17:28,500 --> 03:17:29,800
Who is Neko-san?

3349
03:17:29,800 --> 03:17:31,800
Neko-san team is also here.

3350
03:17:31,800 --> 03:17:34,800
There is no meaning.

3351
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:37,800
This Tadaka-kun is 1!

3352
03:17:37,800 --> 03:17:40,800
Yay!

3353
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:42,800
He's right, he's right!

3354
03:17:42,800 --> 03:17:46,800
This Bōhatsu-Yarōu is also 4!

3355
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:48,800
Yay!

3356
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:50,800
Yay!

3357
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:54,800
This Bōhatsu-Ossan is also 2!

3358
03:17:54,800 --> 03:17:56,800
Yay!

3359
03:17:56,800 --> 03:17:58,800
Correct!

3360
03:17:58,800 --> 03:18:00,800
Correct!

3361
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:03,800
Yay!

3362
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:05,800
Correct!

3363
03:18:07,800 --> 03:18:09,800
Now, the last one!

3364
03:18:09,800 --> 03:18:11,800
Chameleon team!

3365
03:18:11,800 --> 03:18:13,800
Chameleon?

3366
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:15,800
Is it called Chameleon team?

3367
03:18:15,800 --> 03:18:17,800
Now, I just got it.

3368
03:18:17,800 --> 03:18:21,800
I'm the first one, aren't I?

3369
03:18:21,800 --> 03:18:23,800
Correct!

3370
03:18:23,800 --> 03:18:25,800
I'm the second one, aren't I?

3371
03:18:25,800 --> 03:18:27,800
Go ahead!

3372
03:18:27,800 --> 03:18:31,800
I'm the fourth one, aren't I?

3373
03:18:31,800 --> 03:18:33,800
That's correct!

3374
03:18:33,800 --> 03:18:35,800
You say it yourself!

3375
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:37,800
Congratulations!

3376
03:18:37,800 --> 03:18:39,800
Yay!

3377
03:18:39,800 --> 03:18:41,800
Congratulations!

3378
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:45,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

3379
03:18:45,800 --> 03:18:47,800
That's correct!

3380
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:51,800
Everyone, please come out one by one for each team.

3381
03:18:51,800 --> 03:18:55,800
I'll give you a big round of applause.

3382
03:18:55,800 --> 03:18:57,800
You understand, right?

3383
03:18:57,800 --> 03:19:03,800
As much as possible, I think Fukuyaka will be better.

3384
03:19:03,800 --> 03:19:05,800
Now, everyone.

3385
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:09,800
Let's have a toast.

3386
03:19:09,800 --> 03:19:11,800
Fukuyaka is better.

3387
03:19:11,800 --> 03:19:13,800
What is it?

3388
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:16,800
Let's have a toast and play rock-paper-scissors.

3389
03:19:16,800 --> 03:19:18,800
Let's have a toast and play rock-paper-scissors.

3390
03:19:18,800 --> 03:19:20,800
Let's have a toast and play rock-paper-scissors.

3391
03:19:20,800 --> 03:19:23,800
I didn't hear you.

3392
03:19:23,800 --> 03:19:25,800
What? What?

3393
03:19:25,800 --> 03:19:27,800
What are you going to do?

3394
03:19:27,800 --> 03:19:29,800
What are you going to do?

3395
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:31,800
What?

3396
03:19:31,800 --> 03:19:33,800
We're going to play rock-paper-scissors.

3397
03:19:33,800 --> 03:19:35,800
No way.

3398
03:19:35,800 --> 03:19:37,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

3399
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:39,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

3400
03:19:39,800 --> 03:19:41,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

3401
03:19:41,800 --> 03:19:43,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

3402
03:19:43,800 --> 03:19:45,800
It's hard to see.

3403
03:19:45,800 --> 03:19:47,800
Why are you laughing?

3404
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:49,800
Why are you laughing?

3405
03:19:49,800 --> 03:19:51,800
Let's eat.

3406
03:19:51,800 --> 03:19:53,800
Everyone.

3407
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:55,800
Let's do it!

3408
03:19:55,800 --> 03:19:57,800
Oppari janken!

3409
03:19:57,800 --> 03:19:59,800
First, Pai!

3410
03:19:59,800 --> 03:20:01,800
Janken Pai!

3411
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:03,800
Oh, no!

3412
03:20:03,800 --> 03:20:05,800
This is Pa, right?

3413
03:20:05,800 --> 03:20:07,800
This is Gu, right?

3414
03:20:07,800 --> 03:20:09,800
This is Aiko, right?

3415
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:11,800
Aiko and Pai!

3416
03:20:13,800 --> 03:20:15,800
This is Choki, right?

3417
03:20:15,800 --> 03:20:17,800
This is Gu, right?

3418
03:20:17,800 --> 03:20:19,800
Gu and Choki

3419
03:20:19,800 --> 03:20:21,800
I made a mistake

3420
03:20:21,800 --> 03:20:25,800
Let's go to the final round.

3421
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:28,800
Let's go!

3422
03:20:29,800 --> 03:20:31,800
This is embarrassing!

3423
03:20:31,800 --> 03:20:33,800
Be serious!

3424
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:40,800
Rock, paper, scissors!

3425
03:20:46,800 --> 03:20:48,800
This is embarrassing!

3426
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:51,800
Please stand in front of the camera.

3427
03:20:55,800 --> 03:21:01,800
The luxury goods are coming.

3428
03:21:12,800 --> 03:21:14,800
Please wait a moment.

3429
03:21:14,800 --> 03:21:17,800
I heard it's a luxury product.

3430
03:21:17,800 --> 03:21:19,800
What is it?

3431
03:21:19,800 --> 03:21:21,800
It may be a present.

3432
03:21:21,800 --> 03:21:23,800
What is it?

3433
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:25,800
What is it?

3434
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:28,800
Can I have it?

3435
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:31,800
The Moody's.

3436
03:21:31,800 --> 03:21:33,800
The world's Moody's.

3437
03:21:33,800 --> 03:21:38,800
I'm so happy.

3438
03:21:38,800 --> 03:21:41,800
What is it?

3439
03:21:41,800 --> 03:21:45,800
Congratulations!

3440
03:21:45,800 --> 03:21:48,800
Thank you so much!

3441
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:54,800
There are about 50 million people watching this video.

3442
03:21:54,800 --> 03:21:56,800
Please look at the camera.

3443
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:59,800
I'm so happy.

3444
03:21:59,800 --> 03:22:02,800
I use it every day at home.

3445
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:04,800
I use it every day at home.

3446
03:22:04,800 --> 03:22:06,800
It's the fifth machine.

3447
03:22:06,800 --> 03:22:08,800
This is the fourth machine.

3448
03:22:08,800 --> 03:22:10,800
I'm the first machine.

3449
03:22:10,800 --> 03:22:12,800
Thank you very much.

3450
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:14,800
Thank you very much.

3451
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:16,800
It was a matching game.

3452
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:18,800
Let's do it again next time.

3453
03:22:18,800 --> 03:22:20,800
Thank you very much.

3454
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:26,800
Let's look at the boxed room.

3455
03:22:28,800 --> 03:22:30,800
You were young at that time.

3456
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:32,800
Start!

3457
03:22:34,800 --> 03:22:36,800
What is that?

3458
03:22:36,800 --> 03:22:38,800
Let's start!

3459
03:22:38,800 --> 03:22:40,800
Oh!

3460
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:42,800
Wow! It's beautiful!

3461
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:48,800
Wow!

3462
03:22:48,800 --> 03:22:50,800
It looks like a pear tree.

3463
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:52,800
It looks like a pear tree.

3464
03:22:52,800 --> 03:22:54,800
It's interesting.

3465
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:56,800
It looks like a banana tree.

3466
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:58,140
Xuanyi

3467
03:23:56,800 --> 03:23:58,800
I can't drink it.

3468
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:00,800
But you can drink it.

3469
03:24:04,800 --> 03:24:06,800
Drink it.

3470
03:24:06,800 --> 03:24:08,800
What is this?

3471
03:24:09,800 --> 03:24:11,800
It's coming out, it's coming out

3472
03:24:11,800 --> 03:24:13,800
It's funny

3473
03:24:26,800 --> 03:24:29,800
It's been black for a long time

3474
03:24:29,800 --> 03:24:31,800
It's like a movie.

3475
03:24:35,800 --> 03:24:37,800
It's like a movie.

3476
03:24:43,800 --> 03:24:45,800
It's good.

3477
03:24:45,800 --> 03:24:47,800
It's true.

3478
03:24:51,800 --> 03:24:53,800
It's good and fun.

3479
03:24:53,800 --> 03:24:55,800
This is so much fun.

3480
03:24:59,800 --> 03:25:01,800
This is so much fun.

3481
03:25:03,800 --> 03:25:05,800
This is so much fun.

3482
03:25:06,800 --> 03:25:08,800
This is because it's that season.

3483
03:25:09,800 --> 03:25:11,800
It's cold now.

3484
03:26:41,800 --> 03:26:43,800
Let's get on the bus!

3485
03:27:00,800 --> 03:27:02,800
Takobasu!

3486
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:04,800
I'm going to the bathroom.

3487
03:27:10,800 --> 03:27:12,800
Did you turn on the camera?

3488
03:27:12,800 --> 03:27:14,800
I did.

3489
03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:16,800
Let's go!

3490
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:18,800
Let's go!

3491
03:27:18,800 --> 03:27:20,800
Let's go!

3492
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:22,800
Let's go!

3493
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:24,800
Let's go!

3494
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:26,800
Let's go!

3495
03:27:26,800 --> 03:27:28,800
Let's go!

3496
03:27:28,800 --> 03:27:30,800
Let's go!

3497
03:27:30,800 --> 03:27:32,800
Mama!

3498
03:27:33,840 --> 03:27:35,840
Mama looks so fun!

3499
03:27:35,840 --> 03:27:37,840
Neko-kun you're so cute!

3500
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:39,840
Mama looks so cute!

3501
03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:41,840
Oh my god!

3502
03:27:41,840 --> 03:27:43,840
You're a baby!

3503
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:45,840
You're a baby!

3504
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:47,840
I was born!

3505
03:27:47,840 --> 03:27:49,840
I was born!

3506
03:27:49,840 --> 03:27:51,840
Mama is so cute!

3507
03:27:51,840 --> 03:27:53,840
Mama is so cute!

3508
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:55,840
Mama is so cute!

3509
03:27:55,840 --> 03:27:57,840
Mama is so cute!

3510
03:27:57,840 --> 03:27:59,840
Look, it's breast milk.

3511
03:27:59,840 --> 03:28:01,840
Mom!

3512
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:03,840
Mom!

3513
03:28:03,840 --> 03:28:05,840
The breast milk is coming out!

3514
03:28:05,840 --> 03:28:07,840
It's coming out, it's coming out.

3515
03:28:09,840 --> 03:28:11,840
The breast milk is coming out from the mouth.

3516
03:28:11,840 --> 03:28:13,840
Oh, no.

3517
03:28:13,840 --> 03:28:15,840
I'll hold it for you, Ai-chan.

3518
03:28:15,840 --> 03:28:17,840
I've finished brushing my teeth.

3519
03:28:17,840 --> 03:28:19,840
Look.

3520
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:22,840
Let's see how it goes.

3521
03:28:23,840 --> 03:28:25,840
Go ahead.

3522
03:28:29,840 --> 03:28:31,840
Fail.

3523
03:28:32,840 --> 03:28:34,840
The biggest fail in this room.

3524
03:28:36,840 --> 03:28:37,840
What are you going to do?

3525
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:39,840
Say it's a failure.

3526
03:28:39,840 --> 03:28:41,840
I'm going to make an oppa.

3527
03:28:41,840 --> 03:28:43,840
Try sticking it on.

3528
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:45,840
Stick it on.

3529
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:47,840
It's cold!

3530
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:50,840
Shoes, please!

3531
03:28:51,840 --> 03:28:53,840
It's cold!

3532
03:28:55,840 --> 03:28:57,840
It's so cold!

3533
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:02,840
Do we go outside?

3534
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:05,840
It's cold!

3535
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:08,840
Can you close the curtain?

3536
03:29:08,840 --> 03:29:09,840
Are you sure?

3537
03:29:10,840 --> 03:29:12,840
Yes!

3538
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:15,740
I'm sorry. It's night.

3539
03:29:15,740 --> 03:29:17,740
Let's open it when we can see the sea.

3540
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:19,380
No.

3541
03:29:19,380 --> 03:29:21,380
I can see the sea from here.

3542
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:24,080
It's open.

3543
03:29:24,080 --> 03:29:25,180
Let's open it.

3544
03:29:25,180 --> 03:29:27,520
It's true. The next door is also open.

3545
03:29:27,520 --> 03:29:29,520
One, two, three.

3546
03:29:32,940 --> 03:29:34,940
There is something.

3547
03:29:34,940 --> 03:29:35,940
Is it a ghost?

3548
03:29:35,940 --> 03:29:37,140
Who is it?

3549
03:29:37,140 --> 03:29:38,820
What were you doing?

3550
03:29:38,820 --> 03:29:40,320
Who is it?

3551
03:29:40,320 --> 03:29:43,800
I was trying to kiss you, but what are you doing?

3552
03:29:43,880 --> 03:29:47,420
I was petting the window.

3553
03:29:47,500 --> 03:29:49,020
The window?

3554
03:29:49,100 --> 03:29:50,420
You were petting the window?

3555
03:29:50,500 --> 03:29:51,860
It's a new window.

3556
03:29:51,940 --> 03:29:53,860
It's all wet.

3557
03:29:53,940 --> 03:29:56,100
It's all wet here.

3558
03:29:58,280 --> 03:30:00,500
It's all wet.

3559
03:30:00,500 --> 03:30:03,740
Look, this is just the right height for you, Ruu-chan.

3560
03:30:12,080 --> 03:30:13,880
Are you all wearing your underwear?

3561
03:30:13,880 --> 03:30:14,580
Huh?

3562
03:30:14,580 --> 03:30:15,780
Huh? No one's wearing their underwear?

3563
03:30:15,780 --> 03:30:17,080
I'm not wearing my underwear.

3564
03:30:17,080 --> 03:30:18,020
You're lying.

3565
03:30:18,020 --> 03:30:19,380
I'm not wearing my underwear either.

3566
03:30:19,380 --> 03:30:22,020
Why am I the only one wearing my underwear?

3567
03:30:22,020 --> 03:30:22,820
No pants?

3568
03:30:22,820 --> 03:30:23,460
No pants.

3569
03:30:23,460 --> 03:30:24,560
No one's wearing anything on the top.

3570
03:30:24,560 --> 03:30:26,260
The camera went off.

3571
03:30:26,260 --> 03:30:28,460
No pants, no pants.

3572
03:30:28,460 --> 03:30:30,460
Yay!

3573
03:30:30,460 --> 03:30:32,460
I'm not wearing anything.

3574
03:30:32,460 --> 03:30:34,460
You're right.

3575
03:30:34,460 --> 03:30:36,460
Why are you wearing panties?

3576
03:30:36,460 --> 03:30:38,460
Why?

3577
03:30:38,460 --> 03:30:40,460
Why are you wearing panties?

3578
03:30:40,460 --> 03:30:42,460
You can't.

3579
03:30:42,460 --> 03:30:44,460
If you're an AV actress,

3580
03:30:44,460 --> 03:30:46,460
you have to wear no pants and no bra.

3581
03:30:46,460 --> 03:30:48,460
You can't.

3582
03:30:48,460 --> 03:30:50,460
It's natural, right?

3583
03:30:50,460 --> 03:30:52,460
It's always like that.

3584
03:30:52,460 --> 03:30:56,460
I wear room wear and pajamas at home.

3585
03:30:56,460 --> 03:30:57,460
It's NO PAN NO BRA, right?

3586
03:30:57,460 --> 03:30:58,460
No, it's not!

3587
03:30:58,460 --> 03:30:59,460
What?

3588
03:30:59,460 --> 03:31:01,460
Aimee soy sauce is NO PAN NO BRA.

3589
03:31:01,460 --> 03:31:02,460
What?

3590
03:31:02,460 --> 03:31:03,460
There was such a record?

3591
03:31:03,460 --> 03:31:04,460
That's right.

3592
03:31:04,460 --> 03:31:05,460
I didn't know.

3593
03:31:05,460 --> 03:31:06,460
You didn't know?

3594
03:31:06,460 --> 03:31:07,460
That's right.

3595
03:31:07,460 --> 03:31:08,460
If you break it, it's a fine.

3596
03:31:08,460 --> 03:31:09,460
That's right.

3597
03:31:09,460 --> 03:31:10,460
I'll do it today.

3598
03:31:10,460 --> 03:31:11,460
What are you doing today?

3599
03:31:11,460 --> 03:31:12,460
No, no, no.

3600
03:31:12,460 --> 03:31:13,460
It's a little...

3601
03:31:13,460 --> 03:31:14,460
It's a little...

3602
03:31:14,460 --> 03:31:15,460
It's gone.

3603
03:31:15,460 --> 03:31:17,460
So, this is the secret.

3604
03:31:17,460 --> 03:31:18,460
There's no one to tell the secret.

3605
03:31:18,460 --> 03:31:19,460
You have to take it off.

3606
03:31:19,460 --> 03:31:20,460
Why?

3607
03:31:20,460 --> 03:31:21,460
You have to take it off.

3608
03:31:21,460 --> 03:31:22,460
You have to take it off quickly.

3609
03:31:22,460 --> 03:31:23,460
You have to take it off here.

3610
03:31:23,460 --> 03:31:25,460
I'm so excited!

3611
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:37,460
So cute!

3612
03:31:39,460 --> 03:31:41,460
You're so cute!

3613
03:31:43,460 --> 03:31:45,460
Let's go outside!

3614
03:31:45,460 --> 03:31:47,460
Let's run outside!

3615
03:31:47,460 --> 03:31:49,460
Let's run from the hallway.

3616
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:51,460
Let's run from the hallway.

3617
03:31:53,460 --> 03:31:55,460
Let's run from the hallway.

3618
03:31:55,460 --> 03:31:57,460
Let's release all the sounds.

3619
03:31:57,460 --> 03:31:59,460
Full speed.

3620
03:31:59,460 --> 03:32:01,460
Full speed.

3621
03:32:01,460 --> 03:32:03,460
Full power.

3622
03:32:03,460 --> 03:32:05,460
Let's go.

3623
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:07,460
We're going to film.

3624
03:32:07,460 --> 03:32:09,460
Let's go.

3625
03:32:11,460 --> 03:32:13,460
It was too much.

3626
03:32:13,460 --> 03:32:15,460
What are you wearing?

3627
03:32:15,460 --> 03:32:17,460
What are you wearing?

3628
03:32:17,460 --> 03:32:19,460
It looks fun.

3629
03:32:19,460 --> 03:32:21,460
I want to do it too.

3630
03:32:21,460 --> 03:32:23,460
I'm scared.

3631
03:32:23,460 --> 03:32:25,460
It smells good.

3632
03:32:25,460 --> 03:32:27,460
It smells good.

3633
03:32:27,460 --> 03:32:29,460
It smells good.

3634
03:32:29,460 --> 03:32:31,460
It smells good.

3635
03:32:31,460 --> 03:32:33,460
Try it.

3636
03:32:33,460 --> 03:32:35,460
It's 1500 yen for DMV.

3637
03:32:35,460 --> 03:32:37,460
I want to try it too.

3638
03:32:37,460 --> 03:32:39,460
It's hard.

3639
03:32:39,460 --> 03:32:41,460
It's premium.

3640
03:32:41,460 --> 03:32:43,460
It's premium.

3641
03:32:43,460 --> 03:32:45,460
How much is it?

3642
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:47,460
It's so cute.

3643
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:49,460
Is it an auction?

3644
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:51,460
It's 3500 yen.

3645
03:32:51,460 --> 03:32:53,460
It's cheap.

3646
03:32:53,460 --> 03:32:55,460
This one is 5000 yen.

3647
03:32:55,460 --> 03:32:57,460
It's cheap.

3648
03:32:57,460 --> 03:32:59,460
It's in.

3649
03:32:59,460 --> 03:33:01,460
Let's run.

3650
03:33:01,460 --> 03:33:03,460
Let's go.

3651
03:33:03,460 --> 03:33:05,460
Ready, go!

3652
03:33:05,460 --> 03:33:07,460
Cute!

3653
03:33:11,460 --> 03:33:13,460
It just became a show-off.

3654
03:33:13,460 --> 03:33:15,460
Poor you.

3655
03:33:15,460 --> 03:33:17,460
Look, the AV actress is Nobun Nobun.

3656
03:33:17,460 --> 03:33:19,460
Nobun Nobun.

3657
03:33:19,460 --> 03:33:21,460
Nobun.

3658
03:33:21,460 --> 03:33:23,460
Nobun.

3659
03:33:23,460 --> 03:33:25,460
I'm waiting.

3660
03:33:25,460 --> 03:33:27,460
I can't hear Nobun.

3661
03:33:27,460 --> 03:33:29,460
Nobun Nobun.

3662
03:33:29,460 --> 03:33:31,460
It's a basic.

3663
03:33:31,460 --> 03:33:33,460
It's basic.

3664
03:33:33,460 --> 03:33:35,460
Chira!

3665
03:33:35,460 --> 03:33:37,460
Chira!

3666
03:33:37,460 --> 03:33:39,460
Chira!

3667
03:33:39,460 --> 03:33:41,460
Everyone!

3668
03:33:41,460 --> 03:33:43,460
It's wonderful!

3669
03:33:43,460 --> 03:33:45,460
It's wonderful!

3670
03:33:45,460 --> 03:33:47,460
It's wonderful!

3671
03:33:47,460 --> 03:33:49,460
It's wonderful!

3672
03:33:49,460 --> 03:33:51,460
What are you doing?

3673
03:33:51,460 --> 03:33:53,460
Let's run together.

3674
03:33:53,460 --> 03:33:55,460
Let's run together.

3675
03:33:55,460 --> 03:33:57,460
Let's run together.

3676
03:33:57,460 --> 03:33:59,460
What the hell are we doing?

3677
03:33:59,460 --> 03:34:01,460
Let's stand in a line.

3678
03:34:01,460 --> 03:34:03,460
My butt hurts.

3679
03:34:03,460 --> 03:34:05,460
One, two, three, four.

3680
03:34:05,460 --> 03:34:07,460
Ta-da!

3681
03:34:07,460 --> 03:34:09,460
I'm so tired.

3682
03:34:09,460 --> 03:34:11,460
I'm so tired.

3683
03:34:11,460 --> 03:34:13,460
What's going on here?

3684
03:34:15,460 --> 03:34:17,460
You're so small.

3685
03:34:19,460 --> 03:34:21,460
There's a stranger.

3686
03:34:21,460 --> 03:34:23,460
There's a stranger.

3687
03:34:23,460 --> 03:34:25,460
There's a stranger.

3688
03:34:25,460 --> 03:34:26,460
I'm scared.

3689
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:28,460
What's happening?

3690
03:34:28,460 --> 03:34:30,460
It's coming off.

3691
03:34:30,460 --> 03:34:32,460
It's coming off.

3692
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:33,460
It's coming off.

3693
03:34:33,460 --> 03:34:35,460
I like you guys.

3694
03:34:35,460 --> 03:34:37,460
It's coming off.

3695
03:34:37,460 --> 03:34:40,460
They're perverts.

3696
03:34:40,460 --> 03:34:42,460
It's the same with the flag.

3697
03:34:42,460 --> 03:34:44,460
It's the same with the flag.

3698
03:34:44,460 --> 03:34:46,460
It's coming off.

3699
03:34:46,460 --> 03:34:49,460
It's coming off.

3700
03:34:49,460 --> 03:34:51,460
It's coming off.

3701
03:34:51,460 --> 03:34:53,460
Yui Hadake!

3702
03:34:53,460 --> 03:34:55,460
Yui Hadake!

3703
03:34:55,460 --> 03:34:57,460
Yui Hadake!

3704
03:34:57,460 --> 03:34:59,460
Yui Hadake!

3705
03:34:59,460 --> 03:35:01,460
Yui Hadake!

3706
03:35:01,460 --> 03:35:03,460
What are you doing?

3707
03:35:03,460 --> 03:35:05,460
Yui Hadake!

3708
03:35:05,460 --> 03:35:07,460
What is this?

3709
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:09,460
Yui Hadake!

3710
03:35:09,460 --> 03:35:11,460
Yui Hadake!

3711
03:35:11,460 --> 03:35:15,460
Bye-bye!

3712
03:35:15,460 --> 03:35:25,460
I'm going to take a picture of Kamihata Ichika and the girl's room from now on.

3713
03:35:25,460 --> 03:35:27,460
What are you doing?

3714
03:35:27,460 --> 03:35:29,460
It's so funny.

3715
03:35:29,460 --> 03:35:31,460
What are you doing?

3716
03:35:31,460 --> 03:35:33,460
It's so funny.

3717
03:35:33,460 --> 03:35:35,460
I'm so embarrassed.

3718
03:35:35,460 --> 03:35:37,460
Don't be embarrassed.

3719
03:35:37,460 --> 03:35:39,460
I can see your boobs.

3720
03:35:39,460 --> 03:35:41,460
I wonder if someone will come out.

3721
03:35:41,460 --> 03:35:42,760
I can see the boobs!

3722
03:35:42,760 --> 03:35:45,060
I wonder if someone is watching us.

3723
03:35:45,060 --> 03:35:46,060
The boobs!

3724
03:35:46,060 --> 03:35:47,060
I can see the boobs.

3725
03:35:47,060 --> 03:35:50,060
I can't see anyone, so I'm so embarrassed.

3726
03:35:50,060 --> 03:35:52,060
This is bad!

3727
03:35:52,060 --> 03:35:53,060
Let's go to the bathroom.

3728
03:35:53,060 --> 03:35:54,060
We have to go to the bathroom.

3729
03:35:54,060 --> 03:35:55,060
Wait, wait!

3730
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:57,560
Wait!

3731
03:35:58,060 --> 03:36:00,060
Why is Ichika-chan wearing something?

3732
03:36:00,060 --> 03:36:01,060
What is it?

3733
03:36:01,060 --> 03:36:02,560
What is it? It's weird.

3734
03:36:02,560 --> 03:36:03,560
We have to go to the bathroom.

3735
03:36:03,560 --> 03:36:09,560
Let's do it together!

3736
03:36:11,560 --> 03:36:13,560
This is fun!

3737
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:14,560
This feels good!

3738
03:36:14,560 --> 03:36:15,560
Where?

3739
03:36:15,560 --> 03:36:16,560
Over there.

3740
03:36:16,560 --> 03:36:18,560
Is everyone here?

3741
03:36:18,560 --> 03:36:19,560
I don't think so.

3742
03:36:19,560 --> 03:36:20,560
I haven't seen them yet.

3743
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:22,560
Let's take a look.

3744
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:24,560
What is Shizuka doing?

3745
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:25,560
Oh, right.

3746
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:26,560
I wonder what everyone is doing.

3747
03:36:26,560 --> 03:36:27,560
What?

3748
03:36:29,560 --> 03:36:30,560
They're not here.

3749
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:32,060
Where are you guys?

3750
03:36:37,060 --> 03:36:38,060
Where are you?

3751
03:36:38,060 --> 03:36:39,560
I can hear you.

3752
03:36:40,060 --> 03:36:41,560
I can hear you.

3753
03:36:43,060 --> 03:36:44,060
Oh, really?

3754
03:36:44,060 --> 03:36:45,560
What? What? What?

3755
03:36:46,060 --> 03:36:47,060
What? What? What?

3756
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:49,060
Isn't anyone here?

3757
03:36:50,560 --> 03:36:51,560
What are you doing?

3758
03:36:54,060 --> 03:36:55,060
What are you doing?

3759
03:36:55,060 --> 03:36:56,560
You can't see clearly here.

3760
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:58,560
What are you doing?

3761
03:37:02,560 --> 03:37:03,560
What are you doing?

3762
03:37:04,560 --> 03:37:05,560
Don't look at me.

3763
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:07,560
What are you doing?

3764
03:37:08,560 --> 03:37:09,560
What are you doing?

3765
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:12,560
It's a mess.

3766
03:37:13,560 --> 03:37:14,560
Show me.

3767
03:37:15,560 --> 03:37:16,560
What are you doing?

3768
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:17,560
Show me.

3769
03:37:17,560 --> 03:37:23,560
Are you feeling good?

3770
03:37:23,560 --> 03:37:29,560
Are you feeling good?

3771
03:37:29,560 --> 03:37:31,560
Are you getting wet?

3772
03:37:31,560 --> 03:37:33,560
Nishikawa-chan, take a picture of that.

3773
03:37:33,560 --> 03:37:35,560
What's going on there?

3774
03:37:35,560 --> 03:37:36,560
Isn't it amazing?

3775
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:37,560
It's amazing.

3776
03:37:37,560 --> 03:37:39,560
What's going on?

3777
03:37:39,560 --> 03:37:41,560
I'm getting wet.

3778
03:37:41,560 --> 03:37:43,560
Are you getting wet?

3779
03:37:43,560 --> 03:37:45,560
I'm getting wet.

3780
03:37:45,560 --> 03:37:48,560
One, two, three, go!

3781
03:37:51,560 --> 03:37:54,560
Wait, what are you doing hiding under the bed?

3782
03:37:55,560 --> 03:37:58,560
What about Ayu-chan?

3783
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:00,560
I don't know.

3784
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,560
Where did Ayu-chan go?

3785
03:38:02,560 --> 03:38:04,560
Isn't she in her room?

3786
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:06,560
Why is she under the desk?

3787
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,560
Because she's excited.

3788
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:10,560
Are you excited?

3789
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:13,560
Ayu-chan, are you happy?

3790
03:38:13,560 --> 03:38:15,560
Ayu-chan is not here.

3791
03:38:15,560 --> 03:38:16,560
Ayu?

3792
03:38:16,560 --> 03:38:18,560
Ayu-san!

3793
03:38:18,560 --> 03:38:20,560
Where are you?

3794
03:38:20,560 --> 03:38:21,560
I'm in the way.

3795
03:38:21,560 --> 03:38:23,560
Ayu, where are you?

3796
03:38:23,560 --> 03:38:24,560
I'm here.

3797
03:38:24,560 --> 03:38:25,560
You weren't in the room?

3798
03:38:25,560 --> 03:38:26,560
I didn't see you.

3799
03:38:26,560 --> 03:38:27,560
The balcony is open.

3800
03:38:27,560 --> 03:38:29,560
It's cold.

3801
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:30,560
It's cold.

3802
03:38:30,560 --> 03:38:31,560
It's cold.

3803
03:38:31,560 --> 03:38:33,560
Ayu-san, where are you?

3804
03:38:33,560 --> 03:38:35,560
Why?

3805
03:38:35,560 --> 03:38:37,560
Wait, wait, wait.

3806
03:38:37,560 --> 03:38:38,560
No way.

3807
03:38:38,560 --> 03:38:40,560
What's going on?

3808
03:38:40,560 --> 03:38:42,560
What is it?

3809
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:44,560
What is it?

3810
03:38:44,560 --> 03:38:46,560
I don't know what it is.

3811
03:38:46,560 --> 03:38:48,560
I'm sorry.

3812
03:38:50,560 --> 03:38:52,560
Haruka, you're so cute!

3813
03:38:52,560 --> 03:38:54,560
What are you doing?

3814
03:38:54,560 --> 03:38:56,560
What are you doing?

3815
03:38:56,560 --> 03:38:58,560
What are you doing?

3816
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:00,560
You're the best!

3817
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:02,560
You're the best!

3818
03:39:02,560 --> 03:39:04,560
What are you doing?

3819
03:39:04,560 --> 03:39:06,560
What is it?

3820
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:08,560
What is it?

3821
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:12,560
It feels good!

3822
03:39:12,560 --> 03:39:14,560
Amazing!

3823
03:39:14,560 --> 03:39:16,560
What is it?

3824
03:39:16,560 --> 03:39:18,560
Ichi too!

3825
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:20,560
It feels good!

3826
03:39:20,560 --> 03:39:22,560
Ichi too!

3827
03:39:22,560 --> 03:39:24,560
Ichi?

3828
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:26,560
Really?

3829
03:39:26,560 --> 03:39:28,560
It's amazing!

3830
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:30,560
Really?

3831
03:39:30,560 --> 03:39:32,560
Look at her butt!

3832
03:39:32,560 --> 03:39:34,560
It's sticking out!

3833
03:39:34,560 --> 03:39:36,560
It's sticking out!

3834
03:39:36,560 --> 03:39:38,560
It feels so good!

3835
03:39:38,560 --> 03:39:40,560
It feels so good!

3836
03:39:40,560 --> 03:39:42,560
I love it!

3837
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:44,560
It feels so good!

3838
03:39:44,560 --> 03:39:46,560
That was so good!

3839
03:39:50,560 --> 03:39:52,560
That was a kiss!

3840
03:39:52,560 --> 03:39:54,560
Isn't that so good?

3841
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:56,560
I want to do it with you too

3842
03:39:56,560 --> 03:39:58,560
I haven't done it yet

3843
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:00,560
Me neither

3844
03:40:00,560 --> 03:40:02,560
That feels so good

3845
03:40:02,560 --> 03:40:04,560
That feels so good

3846
03:40:04,560 --> 03:40:06,560
It feels so good.

3847
03:40:09,560 --> 03:40:11,560
It feels so good.

3848
03:40:41,560 --> 03:40:43,560
I want to go home.

3849
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:48,560
I want to go home.

3850
03:40:51,560 --> 03:40:53,560
I want to go home.

3851
03:41:05,560 --> 03:41:07,560
You don't want to go home?

3852
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:49,560
Good evening. I'd like to introduce our room.

3853
03:42:49,560 --> 03:42:54,560
Please follow me.

3854
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:57,560
I'm Minato Riku.

3855
03:42:57,560 --> 03:43:00,560
Let me introduce our room.

3856
03:43:00,560 --> 03:43:02,560
Let's go.

3857
03:43:02,560 --> 03:43:04,560
Ta-da!

3858
03:43:06,560 --> 03:43:12,560
They are sleeping now

3859
03:43:13,560 --> 03:43:15,560
One of them is sitting

3860
03:43:15,560 --> 03:43:19,560
The room looks like this

3861
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:23,560
I can hear their voices

3862
03:43:23,560 --> 03:43:25,560
Let's leave them alone

3863
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:28,560
This one is...

3864
03:43:28,560 --> 03:43:35,560
Let's go to the bathroom.

3865
03:43:35,560 --> 03:43:43,560
What are you doing?

3866
03:43:43,560 --> 03:43:46,560
I was in the bathroom.

3867
03:43:46,560 --> 03:43:49,560
You were in the bathroom?

3868
03:43:49,560 --> 03:43:51,560
I was trying to do it.

3869
03:43:51,560 --> 03:43:56,560
Don't worry about me.

3870
03:43:56,560 --> 03:43:59,560
But it's a little embarrassing.

3871
03:43:59,560 --> 03:44:04,560
It's okay. If you want, you can take it off.

3872
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:06,560
Then I can still see it.

3873
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:07,560
It's okay.

3874
03:44:07,560 --> 03:44:09,560
I can't stand it.

3875
03:44:09,560 --> 03:44:11,560
Hurry up.

3876
03:44:13,560 --> 03:44:15,560
Oh no.

3877
03:44:15,560 --> 03:44:17,560
I think I'm being watched.

3878
03:44:17,560 --> 03:44:19,560
I'm nervous.

3879
03:44:19,560 --> 03:44:21,560
I can't stand it.

3880
03:44:22,560 --> 03:44:25,560
I'm peeing.

3881
03:44:25,560 --> 03:44:27,560
Let's take a look at the camera.

3882
03:44:29,560 --> 03:44:32,560
You have a good tongue.

3883
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:34,560
Did you decide that?

3884
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:36,560
I've been holding it in.

3885
03:44:39,560 --> 03:44:42,560
Please stay there.

3886
03:44:43,560 --> 03:44:45,560
Don't leave me.

3887
03:44:45,560 --> 03:44:47,560
Come over here.

3888
03:44:49,560 --> 03:44:53,560
I was suddenly surprised in the bathroom.

3889
03:44:53,560 --> 03:44:57,560
Next, let's take a look at the room.

3890
03:44:58,560 --> 03:45:01,560
I just saw it.

3891
03:45:02,560 --> 03:45:05,560
This back view is probably...

3892
03:45:07,560 --> 03:45:10,560
Ah, she's using it.

3893
03:45:10,560 --> 03:45:20,560
What are you doing there using the rotor?

3894
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:23,560
Who are you?

3895
03:45:23,560 --> 03:45:26,560
I'm KONNO HIKARU.

3896
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:29,560
KONNO HIKARU, what are you doing?

3897
03:45:29,560 --> 03:45:32,560
Please continue.

3898
03:45:32,560 --> 03:45:37,560
Here is ABENOMIKU.

3899
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:39,560
It's open.

3900
03:45:39,560 --> 03:45:41,560
And...

3901
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:45,560
It's a little open.

3902
03:45:45,560 --> 03:45:47,560
Suspicious.

3903
03:45:47,560 --> 03:45:49,560
Suspicious.

3904
03:45:49,560 --> 03:45:51,560
Is it okay to open it?

3905
03:45:51,560 --> 03:45:53,560
Here we go.

3906
03:45:53,560 --> 03:45:55,560
One, two, three!

3907
03:45:55,560 --> 03:45:57,560
Hey!

3908
03:45:59,560 --> 03:46:01,560
What are you doing?

3909
03:46:01,560 --> 03:46:05,560
Tsubomi-san who is doing onani in the back.

3910
03:46:05,560 --> 03:46:07,560
I like darkness.

3911
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:09,560
Do you get excited when it's dark?

3912
03:46:09,560 --> 03:46:11,560
Then I'll keep my hands closed.

3913
03:46:13,560 --> 03:46:15,560
Can you show me?

3914
03:46:15,560 --> 03:46:17,560
You don't have to worry about the camera.

3915
03:46:17,560 --> 03:46:18,560
Can I?

3916
03:46:18,560 --> 03:46:20,560
Yes, please.

3917
03:46:29,560 --> 03:46:34,560
Are you putting your finger in now?

3918
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,560
I can hear the sound.

3919
03:46:36,560 --> 03:46:38,560
I can hear the sound.

3920
03:46:41,560 --> 03:46:43,560
How do you feel about being a girl in the dark?

3921
03:46:43,560 --> 03:46:45,560
Do you feel good?

3922
03:46:45,560 --> 03:46:47,560
I feel good.

3923
03:46:47,560 --> 03:46:49,560
You are cute.

3924
03:46:50,560 --> 03:46:52,560
This is Ms. Tsubumi who is a girl.

3925
03:46:55,560 --> 03:46:59,560
I was surprised that she was a girl when she opened her buttocks.

3926
03:46:59,560 --> 03:47:01,560
What are you doing?

3927
03:47:01,560 --> 03:47:03,560
I'm going to the bathroom.

3928
03:47:03,560 --> 03:47:05,560
I'm back from the bathroom.

3929
03:47:05,560 --> 03:47:07,560
What are you doing?

3930
03:47:07,560 --> 03:47:11,560
I see something over there.

3931
03:47:11,560 --> 03:47:13,560
What?

3932
03:47:13,560 --> 03:47:15,560
Is that a magazine cover?

3933
03:47:15,560 --> 03:47:17,560
A magazine cover.

3934
03:47:17,560 --> 03:47:19,560
You're laughing.

3935
03:47:19,560 --> 03:47:23,560
You're acting suspiciously.

3936
03:47:23,560 --> 03:47:25,560
What are you filming?

3937
03:47:25,560 --> 03:47:28,560
I'm filming an AV right now.

3938
03:47:31,560 --> 03:47:34,560
Miku-chan, do you like girls?

3939
03:47:35,560 --> 03:47:36,560
I like girls.

3940
03:47:36,560 --> 03:47:39,560
Really? I really like girls.

3941
03:47:39,560 --> 03:47:40,560
What?

3942
03:47:41,560 --> 03:47:42,560
Let's kiss.

3943
03:47:46,560 --> 03:47:48,560
Someone take a picture of me.

3944
03:47:51,560 --> 03:47:53,560
I was acting like I was in a good mood.

3945
03:47:53,560 --> 03:47:55,560
Wait wait wait wait wait

3946
03:47:55,560 --> 03:47:57,560
What are you doing?

3947
03:47:57,560 --> 03:47:59,560
She's coming to see

3948
03:47:59,560 --> 03:48:00,560
Wait

3949
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:01,560
So cute

3950
03:48:01,560 --> 03:48:03,560
What is this?

3951
03:48:03,560 --> 03:48:05,560
Look look look

3952
03:48:05,560 --> 03:48:07,560
Look at her butt

3953
03:48:07,560 --> 03:48:09,560
Tsugumi-san is looking at it

3954
03:48:09,560 --> 03:48:11,560
It's a magazine

3955
03:48:11,560 --> 03:48:12,560
Amazing

3956
03:48:12,560 --> 03:48:14,560
It's a magazine

3957
03:48:17,560 --> 03:48:19,560
Amazing

3958
03:48:20,560 --> 03:48:21,560
Are you going to do it?

3959
03:48:21,560 --> 03:48:22,560
You don't like it?

3960
03:48:32,560 --> 03:48:33,560
What did I say?

3961
03:48:35,560 --> 03:48:36,560
I don't like it.

3962
03:48:37,560 --> 03:48:38,560
What did I say?

3963
03:48:38,560 --> 03:48:40,560
You were alone in a dark place.

3964
03:48:41,560 --> 03:48:42,560
You were very sexy.

3965
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:43,560
I was looking at the mirror.

3966
03:48:43,560 --> 03:48:45,560
Were you looking at yourself?

3967
03:48:46,560 --> 03:48:47,560
I found a sexy girl.

3968
03:48:47,560 --> 03:48:48,560
I found a sexy girl.

3969
03:48:48,560 --> 03:48:51,560
Who are you?

3970
03:48:51,560 --> 03:48:54,560
I'm Shinobegami.

3971
03:48:54,560 --> 03:48:57,560
You found me.

3972
03:49:03,560 --> 03:49:05,560
You're so cute.

3973
03:49:05,560 --> 03:49:07,560
What are you going to do?

3974
03:49:07,560 --> 03:49:09,560
Look at me.

3975
03:49:09,560 --> 03:49:12,560
You're so cute.

3976
03:49:12,560 --> 03:49:17,560
Let's leave Tsubomi-san and the other two sleeping together.

3977
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:21,560
I wonder if it's still like this.

3978
03:49:21,560 --> 03:49:23,560
It's still outside.

3979
03:49:25,560 --> 03:49:27,560
Isn't one person not enough?

3980
03:49:27,560 --> 03:49:29,560
One person is not enough.

3981
03:49:29,560 --> 03:49:31,560
Are you hiding your hair?

3982
03:49:31,560 --> 03:49:33,560
No, I'm hiding my hair.

3983
03:49:33,560 --> 03:49:34,560
It's not on the air conditioner.

3984
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:35,560
Wait a minute.

3985
03:49:35,560 --> 03:49:37,560
Look, it's Abeno.

3986
03:49:37,560 --> 03:49:40,560
Good morning, Abeno-san.

3987
03:49:40,560 --> 03:49:42,560
Good morning, Natsume.

3988
03:49:42,560 --> 03:49:44,560
Wait, wait, wait.

3989
03:49:44,560 --> 03:49:46,560
Natsume is here too.

3990
03:49:46,560 --> 03:49:48,560
Natsume Yuki is here too.

3991
03:49:48,560 --> 03:49:50,560
Natsume is here too.

3992
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:52,560
Did you film all of us?

3993
03:49:54,560 --> 03:49:56,560
I filmed Natsume sleeping.

3994
03:49:56,560 --> 03:49:58,560
I filmed Natsume sleeping.

3995
03:49:58,560 --> 03:50:00,560
I filmed Natsume sleeping.

3996
03:50:00,560 --> 03:50:02,560
Really?

3997
03:50:02,560 --> 03:50:04,560
I filmed all of you.

3998
03:50:04,560 --> 03:50:06,560
I filmed all of you.

3999
03:50:06,560 --> 03:50:08,560
I filmed all of you.

4000
03:50:08,560 --> 03:50:11,560
Don't say scary things.

4001
03:50:11,560 --> 03:50:13,560
I thought I dropped something.

4002
03:50:13,560 --> 03:50:14,560
You're kidding, right?

4003
03:50:14,560 --> 03:50:15,560
Because...

4004
03:50:15,560 --> 03:50:17,560
That's where you put the futon.

4005
03:50:17,560 --> 03:50:19,560
Wait, it's dark!

4006
03:50:19,560 --> 03:50:21,560
Scary, scary, scary!

4007
03:50:21,560 --> 03:50:22,560
What?

4008
03:50:22,560 --> 03:50:23,560
Wait, wait, wait.

4009
03:50:23,560 --> 03:50:24,560
There's nothing.

4010
03:50:24,560 --> 03:50:26,560
It's dark, it's dark. Wait a minute.

4011
03:50:26,560 --> 03:50:27,560
What is it?

4012
03:50:27,560 --> 03:50:28,560
Be careful.

4013
03:50:28,560 --> 03:50:30,560
Hey, the camera is too dark to be seen.

4014
03:50:32,560 --> 03:50:33,560
Something is falling.

4015
03:50:36,560 --> 03:50:37,560
Scary, scary, scary.

4016
03:51:07,560 --> 03:51:09,560
Can I get a pillow?

4017
03:51:09,560 --> 03:51:11,560
A blanket.

4018
03:51:11,560 --> 03:51:13,560
What are you doing?

4019
03:51:13,560 --> 03:51:15,560
What are you doing?

4020
03:51:15,560 --> 03:51:17,560
Mikan?

4021
03:51:19,560 --> 03:51:21,560
I was really surprised.

4022
03:51:21,560 --> 03:51:23,560
I was really surprised.

4023
03:51:23,560 --> 03:51:25,560
I was really surprised.

4024
03:51:25,560 --> 03:51:27,560
I was really surprised.

4025
03:51:27,560 --> 03:51:29,560
I was really surprised.

4026
03:51:29,560 --> 03:51:31,560
I was really surprised.

4027
03:51:31,560 --> 03:51:33,560
What's wrong?

4028
03:51:33,560 --> 03:51:35,560
What's wrong?

4029
03:51:35,560 --> 03:51:40,560
KURURUGIMIKAN-SAN is in the middle of the bed.

4030
03:51:40,560 --> 03:51:42,560
What are you doing?

4031
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:44,560
Well...

4032
03:51:44,560 --> 03:51:46,560
What is it?

4033
03:51:46,560 --> 03:51:48,560
What are you doing?

4034
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:52,560
I'm writing down the heart-throbbing and the heart-throbbing of Kimo-dameshi.

4035
03:51:52,560 --> 03:51:54,560
Oh, I see.

4036
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:57,560
I can't understand you.

4037
03:51:57,560 --> 03:52:00,560
I see.

4038
03:52:00,560 --> 03:52:05,560
Everyone's here.

4039
03:52:05,560 --> 03:52:08,560
Abe-no-san, what are you doing with your phone?

4040
03:52:08,560 --> 03:52:10,560
Abe-no-san, what are you doing?

4041
03:52:10,560 --> 03:52:12,560
Abe-no-san?

4042
03:52:12,560 --> 03:52:15,560
What are you doing?

4043
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:18,560
Abe-no-san, what are you doing?

4044
03:52:18,560 --> 03:52:20,560
I'm just waking up.

4045
03:52:20,560 --> 03:52:22,560
Abe-no-san!

4046
03:52:22,560 --> 03:52:24,560
Oh no!

4047
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:32,560
This is Yuki Natsume, who is watching the girls in Abeno-san's village.

4048
03:52:32,560 --> 03:52:35,560
Minato is a good role, so it's okay.

4049
03:52:35,560 --> 03:52:38,560
Really, how many times did you get hit in the head today?

4050
03:52:38,560 --> 03:52:41,560
No, not here.

4051
03:52:41,560 --> 03:52:44,560
I can not go. I can not go.

4052
03:52:44,560 --> 03:52:45,560
Because.

4053
03:52:45,560 --> 03:52:47,560
Really.

4054
03:52:47,560 --> 03:52:50,560
The role to put in the pattern.

4055
03:52:50,560 --> 03:52:53,560
Someone put it in a little bit, just now.

4056
03:52:55,560 --> 03:52:56,560
Really?

4057
03:52:56,560 --> 03:52:58,560
My whole body is in trouble.

4058
03:52:59,560 --> 03:53:01,560
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

4059
03:53:02,560 --> 03:53:03,560
Pervert.

4060
03:53:06,560 --> 03:53:07,560
It doesn't matter.

4061
03:53:07,560 --> 03:53:09,560
Everyone is a pervert.

4062
03:53:10,560 --> 03:53:16,560
Who is the person who was a woman while turning on the rotor?

4063
03:53:16,560 --> 03:53:18,560
Oh, I see.

4064
03:53:19,560 --> 03:53:24,560
Well, then, we'll continue tonight.

4065
03:53:25,560 --> 03:53:29,560
Thank you very much. See you later.

4066
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:31,560
This is for you.

4067
03:53:31,560 --> 03:53:33,560
Did you get it?

4068
03:53:33,560 --> 03:53:35,560
I got it.

4069
03:53:35,560 --> 03:53:37,560
Wait, wait!

4070
03:53:37,560 --> 03:53:39,560
Thank you.

4071
03:53:39,560 --> 03:53:41,560
I'm Tsubomi.

4072
03:53:41,560 --> 03:53:43,560
Thank you.

4073
03:53:43,560 --> 03:53:45,560
I'll start eating.

4074
03:53:45,560 --> 03:53:47,560
Thank you.

4075
03:53:47,560 --> 03:53:49,560
Thank you!

4076
03:53:49,560 --> 03:53:51,560
Thank you.

4077
03:53:51,560 --> 03:53:53,560
Thank you.

4078
03:53:53,560 --> 03:53:55,560
Thank you.

4079
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:57,560
Can I eat Shabu-Shabu?

4080
03:53:57,560 --> 03:53:59,560
This is shabu-shabu.

4081
03:53:59,560 --> 03:54:01,560
This is shabu-shabu.

4082
03:54:01,560 --> 03:54:03,560
Shabu-shabu.

4083
03:54:03,560 --> 03:54:05,560
I can't open it.

4084
03:54:05,560 --> 03:54:07,560
Add vegetables.

4085
03:54:07,560 --> 03:54:09,560
Is this the one with cabbage?

4086
03:54:09,560 --> 03:54:11,560
Yes.

4087
03:54:11,560 --> 03:54:13,560
It looks delicious with vegetables.

4088
03:54:13,560 --> 03:54:15,560
Yes.

4089
03:54:15,560 --> 03:54:17,560
Add vegetables.

4090
03:54:17,560 --> 03:54:19,560
Add meat.

4091
03:54:19,560 --> 03:54:21,560
Yes.

4092
03:54:21,560 --> 03:54:23,560
Cheers.

4093
03:54:23,560 --> 03:54:25,560
Cheers.

4094
03:54:25,560 --> 03:54:27,560
It's good!

4095
03:54:28,260 --> 03:54:30,260
It's good!

4096
03:54:30,260 --> 03:54:32,260
Thank you for the meal!

4097
03:54:32,260 --> 03:54:34,260
Thank you so much!

4098
03:54:34,260 --> 03:54:36,260
Thank you!

4099
03:54:38,260 --> 03:54:40,260
I'm so happy!

4100
03:54:40,260 --> 03:54:42,260

I can't drink it, so I asked Natsume to drink it for me.

It's delicious, isn't it?

4111
03:55:22,260 --> 03:55:23,260
How is the egg?

4112
03:55:23,260 --> 03:55:24,260
