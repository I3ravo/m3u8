00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,880
This is a tour that gives a
dream to an amateur boy.

No.5

27
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,930
It's my favorite number.

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,810

Do you do anything special for today?

I'm drinking a lot of supplies.

00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,060
I'm Okada.

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Who was good? I'm Arai Ryo.

54
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm Arai Ryo.

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm Arai Ryo.

56
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm Arai Ryo.

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320


58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
What?

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,040
You don't have it?

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
What?

61
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,780
I don't have it.

62
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,900
You don't have a seat on the bus, do you?

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Yes, that's all.

64
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:52,160
Thank you for watching
Moody's work from day to day.

65
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,760
I'm Aoi Ibuki and I'm Nozomi Ishihara.

66
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:15,630
Welcome to the legendary super super super
super super super super big, Bakobus tour!

67
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,310
So we have to have him today.

68
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,130
Yeah.

69
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,610
A man who knows everything about
Bakobus, KenKen, aka Shimabukuro Hiroshi.

70
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,890
Yay!

71
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,210
Good morning everyone!

72
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,211
Good morning!

73
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,530
This is Shimabukuro.

74
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,910
It's been 10 years since we last met.

75
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,670
Wow!

76
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,210
It's been 10 years for me, too.

77
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,431
It's been a long time since I had a meal.

78
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,550
I thought I had a stomachache.

79
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,510
No, you didn't.

80
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,010
I thought I had a stomachache.

81
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,030
That's it.

82
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,070
Thank you.

83
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:01,970
Mr. Kenkei.

84
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,710
I'd like to ask you for an advice.

85
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,146
I'd like to ask you for an advice.

86
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,790
Well, if I have to give you an advice,

87
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,750
Everyone, there are a
lot of fun things to do.

88
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,990
That's right.

89
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,691
Let's do our best! Let's have fun!

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,460
Wow!

91
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
Thank you!

92
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,690
I'm sorry I'm late.

93
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,490
Thank you, Mr. KenKen.

94
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,950
And there's one more person.

95
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,150
We have a special guest.

96
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,910
You're curious,
right? I'm Hinari.

97
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,911


98
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,190
I'm Karen Yuzuriha, and I'm in
charge of breasts and premiums.

99
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:53,870
I'm Karen Yuzuriha, and I'm in
charge of breasts and premiums.

100
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,650
I'll do my best to be erotic and fun.

101
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,250
Let's do our best.

102
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:05,040
Thank you so much!

103
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I found it!

104
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
What is it?

105
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
What is it?

106
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,360
It's a member of TASK.

107
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,500
It's me, too!

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,860
I want to write TASK, too.

109
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,160
She is hesitating.

110
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
She is hesitating.

111
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Are you OK?

112
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Let's say the title call.

113
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,860
Ready, set, go!

114
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:35,160
Aim!

115
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:39,680
Welcome to AVNine's
Moody's Thank You Party!

116
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,520
Let's start with the
self-introduction of the actresses.

117
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,800
It's not fun if we introduce
ourselves normally.

118
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,360
How about introducing
ourselves with honking?

119
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,080
Let me introduce myself!

120
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:13,660
Let's introduce ourselves!

121
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Oh my god!

122
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,160
Let's go!

123
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,400
Let's start from the first team.

124
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,340
From us?

125
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Yes, you can start.

126
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,060
From us?

127
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,160
Yes, you can start.

128
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:26,161
Oh my god! I'm nervous.

129
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,440


130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,920
Please introduce yourself again.

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,360
Yes.

132
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,840
Please introduce yourself.

133
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm Nozomi Ishihara.

134
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,721
I'm Nozomi. Nice to meet you.

135
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,700
How many works have you made?

136
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Me?

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I think less than 100.

138
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,900
Can you tell me your best work?

139
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,940
What? Your best work.

140
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,180


141
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,520
Eh? Ruined Orgasm.

142
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
I see.

143
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,200


144
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,900
It's on the right now.

145
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
This one.

146
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Which part?

147
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,940
Which part? The highlight.

148
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,950
The highlight is... the
last scene with the director.

149
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,080
I see.

150
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:13,760
I think it's erotic when Samawari
becomes a man when he is taking a picture.

151
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,140
He is always saying something,
but he has become a boy.

152
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,580
Are you A-san? Please introduce yourself.

153
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,580
I'm A-san. I'm 40 years old and
I came from Fukuoka prefecture.

154
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,120
A-san, you have some features.

155
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,520
I have a wife.

156
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,260
A wife? A mistress?

157
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,100
Yes, I'm a mistress.

158
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm Kenta.

159
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Where is your
wife? She is at home.

160
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300


161
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:40,840
At home?

162
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,220
Yes.

163
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,860
Don't you worry
about her? No, no.

164
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,380
My wife is a bit of a playboy.

165
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,080
I see.

166
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,120
She watches my works together.

167
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,760
I see.

168
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She is like,

169
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm not sure if I should do this or that.

170
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,120
I see.

171
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,780
She is teaching me how to act.

172
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,880
We are Real NTR.

173
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,561
She is like, I think you
need more firepower.

174
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes.

175
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,400
I think I've managed to do something.

176
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Yes.

177
00:11:04,635 --> 00:11:06,280
How many shots can you shoot this time?

178
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a pleasant 15 shots,
but I'd like to shoot 10 shots.

179
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,920
This time, look at this, everyone.

180
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,400
Every time I shoot, this comes to me.

181
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
A little rock taste.

182
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Bang, bang, burst.

183
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Life is about shooting.

184
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,560
It feels like it's going to sell a little.

185
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,840
Life is about shooting.

186
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,260
Think about your wife and make
her stand with a sense of guilt.

187
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:33,940
I'm going to get a divorce.

188
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,200
I can see you.

189
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,740
I'm from the top.

190
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,680
Can I show my
nipples? Of course.

191
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,400
Please show your nipples.

192
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I can't show my nipples.

193
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
I can't.

194
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,600
Of course I can.

195
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,350
One minute left.

196
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,000
Hurry up.

197
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,340
Hurry up! Hurry up!

198
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,220
Moody's is following the rules.

199
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,680
We agree to the invoice.

200
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,640
What do you like?

201
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,540
Do you like Pekoki or Ferrari?

202
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,876
Are you a person who likes to be licked?

203
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,340
I'm a person who likes to be licked.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,020
You're lying.

205
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,420
Ichihara-san seems to be taking a nap.

206
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
He's taking a break.

207
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
I'm not taking a break.

208
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
He's not taking a break.

209
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
It's over.

210
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,440
It's a shame.

211
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,260
I'll do my best next time.

212
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,540
Hello.

213
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,800
I'm Aoi Ibuki, a member of Moody's.

214
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,830
Are you a member
of Moody's? Yes, I am.

215
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,041
How many do you have?

216
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,660
I have about 30 to 40.

217
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,740
You have a long way to go.

218
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
I have a long way to go.

219
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,740
I have a beautiful manko.

220
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,380
You have a beautiful manko.

221
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
You said it yourself.

222
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I have a beautiful manko.

223
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
I have a beautiful manko.

224
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,780
We will see it together later.

225
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,200
Yes.

226
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
We will see it together.

227
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Taku-san, what is that?

228
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Are you a Yari-chin?

229
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
I am a Yari-chin.

230
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,640
Where are you from?

231
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,641
Where? The back.

232
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,000


233
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,480
The back?

234
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,020
Then I'll lick the back a lot.

235
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,480
I'd like to ask you how to be popular.

236
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
How to be popular?

237
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,420
Yes, how to be popular.

238
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,820
How to be popular as a man.

239
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,440
How to be popular as a man.

240
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,940
Well, the ability to embrace.

241
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
The ability to embrace.

242
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,380
Calmness.

243
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,520
How dare you.

244
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,620
Well, by yourself.

245
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Well.

246
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
You should take it off.

247
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,180
You want this, don't you? I do.

248
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:46,181
This.

249
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,580
I want to fill all my arms.

250
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,220
Did you exercise
yesterday? No, I didn't.

251
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
I thought you didn't.

252
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,700
How many days did you
exercise? Only one day.

253
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000


254
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,860
The day before yesterday.

255
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,440
Let's work out for a week.

256
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,520
It's rare to have a day like this.

257
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
That's right.

258
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
What?

259
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
Ten seconds ago.

260
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Oh, no.

261
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,780
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Time's up!

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Oh my god! Why? Nervous.

263
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,200
Nervous.

264
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,000
Nervous.

265
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,100
Nervous.

266
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,720
Nervous.

267
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Nervous.

268
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:50,900
Nervous.

269
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm Yuzuriha Karen, and I'm in
charge of breasts and premiums.

270
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Look, look!

271
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,240
It's Piper!

272
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
She's the youngest, 21 years old!

273
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,500
Yes!

274
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Plus, it's Piper!

275
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,540
Piper!

276
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,040
Nice!

277
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
It's red!

278
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
It smells red!

279
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
How old are you?

280
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,060
I'm 14 years old.

281
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
14 years old!

282
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:16,725
The lemon juice is amazing.

283
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,620
Can I lick it now?

284
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,621
Can I eat it? Let's eat.

285
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,590


286
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,180
Do you watch videos
often? Yes, I do.

287
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,420


288
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Who do you watch?

289
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
We are quite different.

290
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,140
You are not different.

291
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I watch Yuzuriha-san.

292
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,980
You are alone.

293
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,300
Who are you? I
watch Yuzuriha-san.

294
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
You buy everything, don't you?

295
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,320
I buy everything.

296
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,060
Really?

297
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,400
You can't buy it online.

298
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,600
No, I can't.

299
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,100
You can't, can you? No, I can't.

300
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:41,660


301
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,220
I was going to watch it for 300 yen.

302
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
No, you can't.

303
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
I can't.

304
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,620
Do you have a goal today?

305
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,280
How many points
will you get? I'll get 6.

306
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360


307
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
That's pretty low.

308
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
I'll get 6.

309
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,820
6?

310
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,460
Yes.

311
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,676
What's the average number of people?

312
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Is it okay if I get 6?

313
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,500
Well, maybe 15?

314
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,880
15? That's about 11 people.

315
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Ah, I see.

316
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
It's not that much.

317
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Senpai.

318
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,240
I don't really count.

319
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,020
You don't count?

320
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,296
You don't count one
by one? I don't know.

321
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320


322
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,420
You are good at showing the camera.

323
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Really?

324
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Yes, you are good at it.

325
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
It's delicious.

326
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,660
It's easy to swallow
because it's a pie-pan.

327
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,140
It's the same pie-pan as me.

328
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,820
You can do it.

329
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:39,821
Close your eyes.

330
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:51,120
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Time's up!

331
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
What a shame!

332
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm Kana Morisawa.

333
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,920
You look great.

334
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,100
Did you take the train?

335
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:06,280
Did you bring your
bag? Yes, I did.

336
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980


337
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,440
Who are you?

338
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
My name is Koushi.

339
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,600
Yes.

340
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
Let's get started.

341
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,220
You are Koushi,
right? Yes, I am.

342
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,700
Koushi.

343
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Let's eat.

344
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,600


345
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,140
Who told you about
today? My friend.

346
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Don't say that.

347
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
It's a secret.

348
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,020
Don't say that.

349
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Don't say that.

350
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,600
Don't tell anyone.

351
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,480
I'm not planning a tour.
I'm just going to appear in a music video.

352
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,896
You can go after it's released.

353
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Oh, after it's released.

354
00:17:47,560 --> 00:18:04,640
It's delicious.

355
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:16,870
It feels good.

356
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:29,250
Can I touch your
boobs? Yes, you can.

357
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,410


358
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,850
Can I touch your boobs?

359
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,630
I can't stand it.

360
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,590
Show me.

361
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,750
I can't stand it.

362
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,570
Show me.

363
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:38,771
Do you want me to put it down?

364
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,050
It looks so big.

365
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,950
I touched it.

366
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,550
Can you show it
to us? It's gone.

367
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,890
It's the same.

368
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
It's out.

369
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,870


370
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,250
It's embarrassing.

371
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,350
Everyone, it's your
first time to come here.

372
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,690
Thank you very much.

373
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,610
Thank you.

374
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,590
5 seconds left.

375
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,090
Really?

376
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,490
4, 3, Oh, it's true.

377
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,130
It's back.

378
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,670


379
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,330
3,

380
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:04,650
2, 1 It's over.

381
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:05,570
It's a pity.

382
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:06,810


383
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,750


384
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,590
Thank you very much.

385
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,210
Please enjoy the rest of the show.

386
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,550
I really want to go.

387
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,830
Before the show is over.

388
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,850
Has it already
started? It's started.

389
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,430


390
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,770
It's a good feeling,
isn't it? It's fast.

391
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,790
It's fast.

392
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,130


393
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,310
They are kissing.

394
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,950
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:33,991
Please introduce yourself.

397
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,970
I'm Ena Satsuki.

398
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,930
Have you already started?

399
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,970
I couldn't wait.

400
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,470
Please tell me about
your sexual orientation.

401
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,670
Who am I?

402
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,970
I'm asking you who you are.

403
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,290
My sexual orientation is inside the mouth.

404
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,690
I'm in the middle of a kiss.

405
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,930
So I love Pera.

406
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,450
I love kisses, too.

407
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,490
Well, well.

408
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:11,400
I don't mind if you kiss me.

409
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,900
Isuzu-san.

410
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
Yes.

411
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,440
You tried to kill yourself once.

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Yes.

413
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,640
Why again? To live.

414
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
What? To live.

415
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,580


416
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,740


417
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn't know I was going to live.

418
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,240
You didn't know you were going to live?

419
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Yes.

420
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
If you live, more erotic
things will happen.

421
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
That's deep.

422
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,820
I'm glad I'm alive.

423
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,196
But you're glad you're alive, right?

424
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,360
Yes.

425
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Why did you stop there?

426
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,420
I was about to break up officially.

427
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,180
What?

428
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,775
I was about to break up officially.

429
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,680
You were about
to break up? I see.

430
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,100
You should have done it.

431
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Why didn't you
do it? I was scared.

432
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920


433
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,740
You were scared?

434
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,420
Yes.

435
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,060
Did you go to the
cliff? No, I didn't.

436
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,100
Where?

437
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,720
I thought I would go there.

438
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,520
Yes.

439
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
I thought I would go to Tojimbo.

440
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,300
But I couldn't move.

441
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
You couldn't move.

442
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,440
The weather has changed again.

443
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,916
You decided to go to Hakubasu.

444
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,180
Yes.

445
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,016
Are you looking forward to it?

446
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes.

447
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,480
Let's move forward in life.

448
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
We are important.

449
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,660
Look, she's taking it off.

450
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
You have to help her.

451
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
This is what leads to self-injury.

452
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,020
Self-injury?

453
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,960
Is it wrong?

454
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,180
Does it mean that you
are about to be injured?

455
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,260
I read it in a book.

456
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,840
It's a joint work, isn't it?

457
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
What are you going to do?

458
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
This hand!

459
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,100
Yes!

460
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:57,960
Yes!

461
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Yes!

462
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Yes!

463
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
It's a joint work!

464
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Yes!

465
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Yes!

466
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Yes!

467
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,050
Yes!

468
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,360
It's the first soil bath today!

469
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Yes!

470
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,280
Please give me a seat belt.

471
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,580
I'm so excited that I forgot.

472
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,340
You have a seat belt, right?

473
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
It's long, isn't
it? Yes, it's long.

474
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:25,960
Yes, I know.

475
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,660
It's long.

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,200
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680


479
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,740
It's a co-operation.

480
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Sex.

481
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,260
You can overcome anything, right?

482
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,540
Yes.

483
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,280
In the end.

484
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Yes.

485
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
If you break it.

486
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:46,040
Please send a message to the
people who are trying to save their lives.

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,860
Keep going until something good happens.

488
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,320
10 seconds left.

489
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,740
10 seconds left.

490
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,620
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

491
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,780
Time's up.

492
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,540
Why don't you
take it out? It's okay.

493
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,160
Let's go out secretly later.

494
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,460
You are so kind.

495
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,680
Thank you very much.

496
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,560
I'm No.11.

497
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,980
Are you No.

498
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,080
11? Can you introduce
yourself again? Of course.

499
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,280
Me? Yes, you.

500
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,180


501
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400


502
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,890
Who are you?

503
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,980
You look like a man.

504
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm Uta Hibino. Nice to meet you.

505
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,600
What is your specialty?

506
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,000
What do you want
people to pay attention to?

507
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,540
I'm good at shio-fuki and kizuo-i.

508
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
Can you do self-defense?

509
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,820
I can do anything.

510
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
Anything? I'm looking forward to it.

511
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,375
I want people to pay attention to that.

512
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,860
Let's get started.

513
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:01,861
Let's go.

514
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,580
You're Yuuki, right?

515
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Yes.

516
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,280
What do you do for
a living? I'm a nurse.

517
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780


518
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh, you're a nurse.

519
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Yes.

520
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
I see.

521
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,340
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

522
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,240
I've had a lot of girlfriends at work.

523
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
Have you ever had
sex? No, I haven't.

524
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,120


525
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,440
But if there's a nice girl
around, I approach her.

526
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:28,760
I want to approach.

527
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,320
Haven't you done it yet?

528
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,300
I've almost done it.

529
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,520
What will you do if you
get sued? I'll apologize.

530
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,260
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,840


532
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,516
You want to be an AV
actor, don't you? I do.

533
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540


534
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,980
What kind of AV actor do you want to be?

535
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,120
I want to be all over the place.

536
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:55,360
They eat a lot.

537
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Do they stand up? Yes, they do.

538
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,370


539
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,570
Do they stand up? Yes, they do.

540
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960


541
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,500
Please raise your hands
if you are in a hurry.

542
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,520
This is the first launch.

543
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
I think we can do it.

544
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
I think so, too.

545
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,540
Oh, no.

546
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,140
Here we go.

547
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:33,141
Let's go.

548
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Raise your hands.

549
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Let's go.

550
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,640
Did you get it?

551
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Yes.

552
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,970
This is it.

553
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,510
Great.

554
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:57,830
Great.

555
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,590
It's the first launch.

556
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,110
It's the first launch in a week.

557
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,890
I'm getting sleepy.

558
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,150
I'll give you this.

559
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,150
Thank you.

560
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,406
It's my first time to shoot.

561
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:12,710
Put it on.

562
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,250
Thank you.

563
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,230
Life is about shooting.

564
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,550
It's great.

565
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,630
How was it?

566
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,330
It was so good that I couldn't hold it.

567
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,710
How long did you
hold it? One week.

568
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,270


569
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,110
This is the right answer.

570
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,390
Yes.

571
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,230
It was good, wasn't it?

572
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,410
Yes, it was great.

573
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,890
I was nervous all the time.

574
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,370
Thank you very much.

575
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,070
Thank you very much.

576
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,071
Finally, it's like AV.

577
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,550
Thank you very much.

578
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,750
It's already started.

579
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,470
Please introduce yourself.

580
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,450
I'm Alice Watson.

581
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,010
Nice to meet you.

582
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,710
You are young.

583
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,450
Am I?

584
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,010
I think I'm the oldest among them.

585
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,210
Someone said the same thing.

586
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,830
Is that so? No way.

587
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,590


588
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,570
Because I'm the 11th year of Gale Key.

589
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:57,550
What?

590
00:26:57,551 --> 00:27:02,410
So even if you started at 18,
you're about 29 years old, right?

591
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,090
No, I'm 20 years old.

592
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,390
I see.

593
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,790
Please introduce yourself.

594
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:09,930
I'm Takuro.

595
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,230
Takuro, do you want to be an AV director?

596
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,650
Yes.

597
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,430
Do you have any plans?

598
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,730
I heard I've been saving up for a week.

599
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,690
Why?

600
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,930
I've been working hard.

601
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,450
Working hard?

602
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:23,810
Yes.

603
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,070
What kind of director do
you want to be? Hardware.

604
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,390
Hardware.

605
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,790
For example?

606
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,310
Mr.Peloto.

607
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:31,670
Oh!

608
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,290
Then, please enjoy the film.

609
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,830
I was very nervous just now.

610
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,490
Because I saw Uta-chan's film.

611
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,510
I was very nervous.

612
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,170
I was nervous.

613
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,150
He is very macho.

614
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:57,370
Look! It's coming out!

615
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,090
Do you want to touch it?

616
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,830
Touch it!

617
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,090
Look! It's licking you!

618
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,070
It's licking you!

619
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,690
That's right!

620
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,170
That's right!

621
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,450
Say, Mama!

622
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,870
Say, Mama!

623
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,230
What?

624
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,670
Say, Mama!

625
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,310
Mama!

626
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,830
That's right!

627
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,410
Babu babu nitsuka?

628
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,670
That's right!

629
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,470
This one too!

630
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,510
Babu!

631
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:23,930
Do you like it? It's cute.

632
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,470


633
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,250
Is it F cup?

634
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,290
I think it's H cup.

635
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,470
Excuse me, it's H cup.

636
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:36,471
Look, it's coming out.

637
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,650
It's amazing.

638
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,470
You have to say it more carefully.

639
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,450
I want to see it.

640
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,846
You want to see
it, right? Yes, I do.

641
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,870


642
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,830
I'm going to get a good one.

643
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,310
Do you want it? I'll get it.

644
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,350
Please.

645
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,750
Don't eat it.

646
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,090


647
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,870
I'll give it to you.

648
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,170
Don't eat it.

649
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,430
You want to see it, don't you?

650
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,430
You want to see it, don't you?

651
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,630
Is it good?

652
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,830
You have to say it.

653
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,470
You want to see it.

654
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,970
I want to see it.

655
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,870
Show me.

656
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,090
Show me.

657
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,970
This is the first time
for everyone to see it.

658
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,950
This is the first time for
everyone to see the mosaic.

659
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,410
This is a digital mosaic since 2004.

660
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,350
It feels good.

661
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,910
Maybe it's a little darker than before.

662
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,750
It's one minute before.

663
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,550
Please lick it.

664
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,470
Please lick it.

665
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,990
Wow!

666
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,310
This is not a small one.

667
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,910
Yes, it is.

668
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,090
Isn't it?

669
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,210
But he watches my works a lot.

670
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,210
Does he?

671
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,230
Yes, so I want to do something hard.

672
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,930
That's good.

673
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,770
What do you like about him?

674
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,210
He has a long tongue.

675
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:08,830
What?

676
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,890
He has a long tongue.

677
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,170
If you have a long tongue,
who do you like? I like blondes.

678
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,810


679
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,530
You like blondes, don't you?

680
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:16,531
It's a short hair.

681
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,290
10 seconds left.

682
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,290
I like long hair.

683
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,430
Put your hair down.

684
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,550
You should do it.

685
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,290
Time's up.

686
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,290
It's a pity.

687
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,110
Why didn't you do it?

688
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,970
I couldn't concentrate.

689
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:44,110
I couldn't do it.

690
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,350
I know.

691
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,530
Well, that's it.

692
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,050
I was nervous.

693
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,650
You were nervous.

694
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,830
Well, good luck.

695
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,650
Do you think you will win
the bronze medal this time?

696
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,130
Blue-winged horse.

697
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,210
Blue-winged horse.

698
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,470
Bronze medal.

699
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,950
What should I do?

700
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,210
Did you win the bronze medal?

701
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,630
What should I do?

702
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,130
Me?

703
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,650
Yayoi Mizuki?

704
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,050
Is it OK? Actually.

705
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:04,970
..

706
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:05,971
But you are not.

707
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,270
I will win the bronze medal with Arai Rima.

708
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,970
Actually, Arai Rima was good.

709
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,290
Do you like Arairima-chan?

710
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,390
Do you know that I
like her? She is here.

711
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,470
Wait.

712
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,810
You are next to Yayoi Mizuki.

713
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,870
Are you ready?

714
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,510
Are you ready? I'll kiss you.

715
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,270


716
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,350
It's your first kiss, isn't it?

717
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,990
It's my first kiss.

718
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,330
I'll steal your first kiss.

719
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,630
Are you ready?

720
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,630
Are you ready? Wait a minute.

721
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,210


722
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,926
Is it better to have different eyes?

723
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,270
The first kiss is...

724
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,410
The first kiss is...

725
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,630
I'll steal it.

726
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,990
I'll steal it.

727
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,990
You are happy, aren't you?

728
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,031
You are happy, aren't you?

729
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,450
You are happy, aren't you?

730
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:54,950
You are happy, aren't you?

731
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,470
You are happy, aren't you?

732
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,470
You are happy, aren't you?

733
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:06,110
You are happy, aren't you?

734
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:07,290
You are happy, aren't you?

735
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,210
You are happy, aren't you?

736
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,226
You are happy, aren't you?

737
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,310
You are happy, aren't you?

738
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,510
I want Mizuki-chan to do it.

739
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,990
I'm going to cry.

740
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,710
Look at me.

741
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,390
I'm going to get your fans' attention.

742
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,510
You're cute.

743
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,810
You look like a mussel.

744
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,910
Where is Kito?

745
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,330
Kito! I found him.

746
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,570
I'm nervous.

747
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,770


748
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,610
You're not cute.

749
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:37,611
Don't do that.

750
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,990
Your face turned red.

751
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,430
Are you OK?

752
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,330
Are you nervous? Yes, I am.

753
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,290


754
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,210
Your face is so red.

755
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,990
You are so cute.

756
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,090
I was wondering how you
would feel when I touch you.

757
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,870
I was imagining it.

758
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,080
Your dream will come true.

759
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,230
Yes, it will.

760
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,290
Let's eat.

761
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,870
It feels good.

762
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,430
You washed your hair
yesterday, didn't you? Yes, I did.

763
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,610
Did you wash your
hair? Yes, I did.

764
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,610


765
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,730
How did you do it?

766
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,490
I washed my hair carefully.

767
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,990
Yes, you did.

768
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,150
Yes, I did.

769
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:20,550
I think your hair will grow out.

770
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,690
Oh, no.

771
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,410
It's OK.

772
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,050
Oh, it grew out.

773
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,730
It's so cute.

774
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,170
It grew out.

775
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,650
It's so red.

776
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:32,651
It's so cool.

777
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,610
All the blood is coming to me.

778
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,170
Thank you so much.

779
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,950
It feels so good.

780
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,290
All of it.

781
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,870
You will fall down later.

782
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,230
All of it.

783
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,190
It's so cool.

784
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,230
You will remember today when you die.

785
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,770
That's right.

786
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,510
It's so cool.

787
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,830
It's so cool?

788
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,970
You should go there.

789
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,670
Should I?

790
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,810
You should go there.

791
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:00,971
You don't have to
be Rimochi! Oh, no.

792
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,830
You want to come,
don't you? No, I don't.

793
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,110


794
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,470
I don't want to.

795
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,310
I'll go.

796
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,790
You want to go,
don't you? Oh, no.

797
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,330


798
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,490
I can't think of anything.

799
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:29,571
You can't think of Rimochi?

800
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,226
I can't think of anything.

801
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,550
Really? Really.

802
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:31,910


803
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,750
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

804
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,230


805
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,650
Is it the best?

806
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:34,651
How do you feel?

807
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,430
Scream!

808
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,070
How do you feel?

809
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,330
How do you feel?

810
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,490
Do you want me to shake more?

811
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,250
It's real!

812
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,170
Why couldn't I say that in my life?

813
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,690
One minute left!

814
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,030
It's a waste to take it off.

815
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,310
I have to take it off.

816
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,530
It's a waste to take it off.

817
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,030
I want to take it off.

818
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,190
It's a waste.

819
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:12,430
You've caught a lot of AV, haven't you?

820
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,690
I've caught a lot.

821
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,510
You've bought it,
haven't you? Yes, I have.

822
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,070
Which one? Delivery?

823
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,350
Yes, it's a delivery.

824
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,730
It's like a delivery from a delivery man.

825
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,530
It's a regular delivery.

826
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,531
Of course.

827
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,430
But it's 300 yen,
isn't it? No, it's not.

828
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,650


829
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,650
It's not a campaign,
is it? No, it's not.

830
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,250


831
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,710
It's not a campaign,
is it? No, it's not.

832
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:34,590
Thank you very much.

833
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,990
Please buy a new swimsuit.

834
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,770
Yes, I will.

835
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,010
I'm waiting for you.

836
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,370
It feels good, doesn't it?

837
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,290
10 seconds left.

838
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,390
10 seconds left.

839
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,710
I can't hold it.

840
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Hurry up.

841
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,530
I'm in a hurry.

842
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:56,750
Oh no! They are running.

843
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,130
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

844
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:05,131
Finish!

845
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,190
I knew it!

846
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,470
My erotic director is annoying, isn't he?

847
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,650
I told you not to be loud.

848
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:15,730
You've been annoying!

849
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,170
You shut up!

850
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,970
I did not want to tell you!

851
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,750
We have many chances!

852
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,550
Congratulations! You're a grown-up now!

853
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,570
You're sweating so much!

854
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,430
You're so cute!

855
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,830
It was fun!

856
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,046
How many times are you going to do it?

857
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,130
What's your plan?

858
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,651
I want to do it with everyone.

859
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,710
You bastard!

860
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,450
I won't forgive you!

861
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,630
Let's go to the next one!

862
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,230
I'm going to take it away!

863
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,190
Thank you very much!

864
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,970
It was fun!

865
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:49,971
No.5.

866
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,951
Please introduce yourself.

867
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,750
I'm Misono Akiya. Nice to meet you.

868
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,390
Nice to meet you.

869
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,461
What is your charming point?

870
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,310
Charming point?

871
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,370
Where do you feel
confident? My boobs.

872
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,390
Your boobs.

873
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,530


874
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,490
What is your size?

875
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:08,890
From the bottom.

876
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,330
From the bottom.

877
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:15,270
My butt is over 90cm.

878
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,271
I have more than 60cm.

879
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,190
It's not good to hit the back of your butt.

880
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,290
To the back of my butt.

881
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,330
Is it OK to hit?

882
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:24,790
No.

883
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,030
No? It's OK.

884
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,790


885
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,970
It's OK?

886
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,210
Is it a little bit smaller than the middle?

887
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,070
Which do you think?

888
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,410
Which do you think?

889
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:36,930
Which do you think?

890
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,150
Yes.

891
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,730
And the middle?

892
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,390
The middle?

893
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,570
Do I have to say it?

894
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,490
You can hide it.

895
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:42,950
How tall are you?

896
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,330
I'm about 60 cm.

897
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,970
And you?

898
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,870
I'm about 95 cm.

899
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,390
You're tall.

900
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:53,210
I'm G cup.

901
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,450
You're G cup.

902
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,770
You look like G cup.

903
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,310
Do you want to
see it? Yes, I do.

904
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,770
Please show me.

905
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,650
I'm G cup.

906
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,690
You look tall.

907
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,690
You look tall.

908
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,230


909
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,570
This is a camisole.

910
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,710
Camisole, isn't it?

911
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,331
In the past, it was called a shimizu.

912
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,850
Oh, great!

913
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,850
Don't bend it!

914
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,770
How is it? It's so erotic.

915
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,010


916
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,470
Isn't this light blue underwear great?

917
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,470
It's great, isn't it?

918
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,850
Do you want to see it?

919
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,850
Can I? No, not me.

920
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,350


921
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,190
I want to see it.

922
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:35,191
I'd like to go there.

923
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,230
Oh my god!

924
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,550
She is so erotic.

925
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,330
Let's go there.

926
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,630
Let's lick here.

927
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,370
Yes, here.

928
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,110
Let's take it off.

929
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,950
Who are you? Are
you Ren? Yes, I'm Ren.

930
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,110
Excuse me.

931
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,090


932
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,970
Someone is being bitten.

933
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,830
Is it a string? Yes, it is.

934
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,030


935
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,130
What do you do for a living?

936
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:07,131
I'm a concierge.

937
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:07,750
What do you do for a living?

938
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:07,810
I'm a concierge.

939
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,910
That's cool.

940
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,036
You're a manager of a concierge.

941
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,330
Yes, I am.

942
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,150
That's cool.

943
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,370
How do you feel? I feel great.

944
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,050
How do you feel? I feel great.

945
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,390


946
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,070
Compared to her? I feel great.

947
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,210
It's too much.

948
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:30,290
It's rude.

949
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,010
It hurts.

950
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,130


951
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,470
How do you feel? It feels good.

952
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,650


953
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,430
How do you feel? It's terrible.

954
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,950
I have a cramp.

955
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,490


956
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,450
You have a cramp?

957
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,790
Yes.

958
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,250
Take a deep breath.

959
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,190
It's getting lighter.

960
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,270
Isn't it better to let it out?

961
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,490
What should I do? Of course.

962
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,810


963
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,790
What should I do?

964
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:01,390
I want to do it.

965
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,770
I'll give it to you.

966
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,910
Really?

967
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:06,710
You want the launch
version, don't you? Yes, I do.

968
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:07,711


969
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,930
Really?

970
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,890
Do you really want it?

971
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,030
I really want it.

972
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:13,930
Don't sell it.

973
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:14,550
Don't sell it.

974
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,370
I won't.

975
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,470
I'll keep it.

976
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,810
One minute left.

977
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,670
The situation is not good.

978
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:23,711
I'm happy to see you, Mom.

979
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,370
I see.

980
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,770
You're in the movie, right?

981
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,230
Yes.

982
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,350
You're in the movie a lot.

983
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,850
Yes.

984
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:33,910
I'm happy to see you.

985
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,191
I want you to show me your face.

986
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,830
Yes.

987
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,170
I'm happy to see you.

988
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,190
Yes.

989
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,410
I'm happy to see you.

990
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,450
How do you feel?

991
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,130
Take a deep breath.

992
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,090
Take a deep breath.

993
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,650
Take a deep breath.

994
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,010
I'm taking a deep breath.

995
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,810
We don't have much time.

996
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,830
Isn't it better if you take a deep breath?

997
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,210
10 seconds left.

998
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,450
I'm not in a hurry.

999
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,350
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1000
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,090
Time's up.

1001
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,931
This is the 13th year
anniversary of AV-JUICY.

1002
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,850
How do you feel?

1003
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:16,610
Are you nervous?

1004
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,950
I'm very nervous.

1005
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,870
If you get so much attention,
you'll have plenty of chances later.

1006
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,890
Thank you very much.

1007
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,110
Next is No.13.

1008
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,170
Thank you for waiting.

1009
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,750
I'm Arai Rima.

1010
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,050
This is the 13th year
anniversary of AV-JUICY.

1011
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:34,051
Nice to meet you.

1012
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,530
Can I ask you about your
first experience? Me? Yes, you.

1013
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,290


1014
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,510


1015
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,770
Who are you asking?

1016
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,791
You can't ask this person.

1017
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,430
I can't help it.

1018
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,530
You can't help it.

1019
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,610
When I was 19 years old,

1020
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:57,270
I had an affair with my
boyfriend at that time.

1021
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,050
Did it hurt? It didn't hurt.

1022
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,910
It felt good.

1023
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,590


1024
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,350
How many men do you think you are?

1025
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,290
I really don't know.

1026
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,270
That's cool.

1027
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,330
Are you a takoyaki chef?

1028
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,810
What do you do for a living?

1029
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,230
I work as a delivery man.

1030
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,670
What do you do? Mostly.

1031
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,130
..

1032
00:42:31,145 --> 00:42:32,466
Do you say, 「Ren-san, I'm No.

1033
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,630
2!」? No, I don't.

1034
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:34,090
You don't?

1035
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,350
I'm the receptionist.

1036
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:35,890
Oh, you're the receptionist.

1037
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:36,410
I'm the receptionist.

1038
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,070
Oh, you're the receptionist.

1039
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:37,490
I'm the receptionist.

1040
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,370
You're used to treating
girls, aren't you? No, not at all.

1041
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,890


1042
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,490
Not at all?

1043
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:46,870
I'm very polite.

1044
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,130
You're very polite.

1045
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,750
Of course you are.

1046
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,010
Yes.

1047
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,010
You're quite big.

1048
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,510
I'm not that big.

1049
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,030
He's big.

1050
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,670
Oh, really? It's hard.

1051
00:42:56,671 --> 00:42:57,770


1052
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:01,906
I think it's the biggest one
among the triangles so far.

1053
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:02,570
Really? I think so.

1054
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,330


1055
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,770
I've never seen a human's penis.

1056
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,590
Who is it?

1057
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,610
If you want to be an
actor, you have to look at it.

1058
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:12,570
I see.

1059
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,990
You rub it.

1060
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,510
You rub it with a 3-Pin Ferrari.

1061
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,350
Oh, do I rub it? Yes, you do.

1062
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,090
It's disgusting.

1063
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,990
I want to show it.

1064
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,986
Today is your day
off, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1065
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,670


1066
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,990
Are you sure? Yes, I am.

1067
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,550
Are you in a hurry
today? No, I'm not.

1068
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,910
Oh, you're not.

1069
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,770
Don't say that.

1070
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:36,090


1071
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,530
Yes.

1072
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,230
I think you have high
expectations for the launch.

1073
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,950
What do you think?

1074
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,050
Well, I'm not sure.

1075
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,410
But I'm being asked,
aren't I? Yes, you are.

1076
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,370
I'm so sorry.

1077
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:47,371


1078
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,410
It's my job to ask.

1079
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:51,990
Yes.

1080
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:53,430
Let's do it.

1081
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,610
Do you want to rub it?

1082
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,550
Rub?

1083
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,090
Do you want to take it off?

1084
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,830
Do you want to take
it off? No, I don't.

1085
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:06,230
Don't take it off.

1086
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,330
No, I don't.

1087
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:07,710
I'll take it off.

1088
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,210
Take it off.

1089
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,650
I won't hold it.

1090
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:13,770
I won't.

1091
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:14,771
I won't.

1092
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,810
It's OK.

1093
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,610
I'll take it off.

1094
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,730
I couldn't sleep because
I was looking forward to it.

1095
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,350
You thought you were going to do it
with everyone, didn't you? That's the one.

1096
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:44,740
That's the one.

1097
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,460
This one? That's the one.

1098
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,240
That's the one.

1099
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,440
That's the one.

1100
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:47,900
That's the one.

1101
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:49,121
Do you understand?
That's the one.

1102
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,540
That's the one.

1103
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:56,100
Can you touch
the ball? I'm sorry.

1104
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,980
I'm sorry.

1105
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,196
If you can do it in 10
seconds, you'll be the MVP.

1106
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,220
Ah, wait!

1107
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:12,700
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1108
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,440
Time's up!

1109
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
What a shame!

1110
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,860
What a shame!

1111
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,626
You were a little nervous,
weren't you? Yes, I was.

1112
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,890
Were you nervous? Yes, I was.

1113
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,030


1114
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,321
There are a lot of men
who don't know how to lose.

1115
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,510
That's true.

1116
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,890
You were surrounded by old men.

1117
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,510
That's true.

1118
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,910
Thank you very much!

1119
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:32,690
Thank you very much.

1120
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:33,691
Thank you very much.

1121
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,770
Next is No.6.

1122
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,590
Let's go to No.6.

1123
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,750
Yes.

1124
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,890
Please introduce yourself.

1125
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,370
My name is Mary Tachibana.

1126
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,150
Wonderful.

1127
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,230
Your costume is wonderful.

1128
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,430
Thank you.

1129
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,966
Your bare face is wonderful, isn't it?

1130
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,270
It's wonderful if I take it off.

1131
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,170
Could you tell us about your costume?

1132
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,230
Could you tell us about my costume?

1133
00:45:58,231 --> 00:45:59,570
What is your favorite size?

1134
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:07,750
My favorite size is about 92cm,
about 60cm, and about 90cm.

1135
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,570
What is your favorite skill?

1136
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,430
My favorite skill is... I have a lot of
saliva, so I use home-made lotion.

1137
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,070
Home-made lotion?

1138
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,670
I'm hyperactive.

1139
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,950
And...

1140
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,831
I can control my blood pressure.

1141
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,750
You can control your
blood pressure very well.

1142
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:28,490
So, you're going to shoot as
you want, right? I don't know.

1143
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:29,990


1144
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,270
Right? I don't know.

1145
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,430


1146
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,630
Don't you want to see your boobs?

1147
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:36,810
Can I?

1148
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:37,730
I want to see them.

1149
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,870
Then, ask me.

1150
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,250
I can't ask you.

1151
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,570
Can I see your boobs?

1152
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,380
I can't see both.

1153
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,460
I want to see the inside.

1154
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
Please.

1155
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,720
I'm going to break it.

1156
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
How is it?

1157
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,600
I've never seen such a soft one.

1158
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,640
It looks soft, doesn't it?

1159
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,060
Can I touch it? Just a little.

1160
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480


1161
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,000
My hands are sweating.

1162
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,480
I'm touching it.

1163
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,780
How is it?

1164
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,360
It's my first time.

1165
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Is it a match? Yes, I am.

1166
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,500


1167
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,400
You are not going to that
office, are you? No, I am not.

1168
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,516
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1169
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,036
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1170
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,316
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1171
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,920
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1172
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,140
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1173
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:33,500
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1174
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,256
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1175
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,720
You are not going
to that office?

1176
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,140
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1177
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,780
You are not going to
that office? No, I am not.

1178
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:53,040


1179
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,500
Oh, it's already standing.

1180
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,340
It's a little bigger.

1181
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,400
Yes, it is.

1182
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,760
This is a natural lotion.

1183
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,320
Does it feel good?

1184
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,500
Do you like it?

1185
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:34,600
It's because of you that
the world went bankrupt.

1186
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,020
May I? Yes, please.

1187
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320


1188
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,970
It's easy to shoot without a camera.

1189
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,890
It's smooth.

1190
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,650
My stomach is connected to the universe.

1191
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,750
I want to do it.

1192
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,470
Do you want to do it? Yes, I do.

1193
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,370


1194
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,590
I will definitely do it.

1195
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,670
Definitely.

1196
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,730
Definitely.

1197
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:30,180
Can you do it?

1198
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,680
I wonder if I can.

1199
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,460
There is only one minute left.

1200
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,320
There is only one minute left.

1201
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,700
I'm sorry.

1202
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,380
Ah, but it feels good, so
it's getting red here, isn't it?

1203
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:54,580
Do you want me to bite your nipple?

1204
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,120
Yes.

1205
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,320
Do you want me to bite it?

1206
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
Yes.

1207
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,300
Can I take it off?

1208
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Please take it off.

1209
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,520
Can I take it off?

1210
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:02,521
Please take it off.

1211
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,440
It's coming out now.

1212
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,500
I think this is good.

1213
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,501
It's good, isn't it?

1214
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,370
We only got a couple of pictures.

1215
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,750
The director said he wanted a picture.

1216
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:23,970
Concentrate.

1217
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:25,930
Concentrate.

1218
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,010
Look. Who's talking?

1219
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,310
Who is it? It's Mary.

1220
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,700
It's Mary.

1221
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,270


1222
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,310
Mary is talking.

1223
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,250
Look. Open your eyes.

1224
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,290
Don't put on your glasses.

1225
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,590
Look at me.

1226
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,310
Those are the glasses.

1227
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:47,850
Ten seconds.

1228
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,150
Ten seconds.

1229
00:50:51,780 --> 00:51:03,410
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one.

1230
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,830
Let's go.

1231
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,910
It's cool, isn't it?

1232
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,270
It's cool, isn't it?

1233
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,310
It's like a baby rider.

1234
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,010
It's cool, isn't it?

1235
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:31,540
Look at that medallion.

1236
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,820
It's like this.

1237
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,260
Did you feel good? No, I didn't.

1238
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,421
I didn't feel good.

1239
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,280
I did it.

1240
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,336
How do you feel about
the taste of life and death?

1241
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,360
Is it bitter? No, it's sweet.

1242
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,780
Is it sweet? Yes, it is.

1243
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,040
It's sweet.

1244
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
I'm happy.

1245
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,040


1246
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,560
Great! Thank you very much.

1247
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,800
This is the second launch.

1248
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,080
We did it!

1249
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,780
The shooting is going well.

1250
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,530
I'm so excited.

1251
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,340
Thank you very much.

1252
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,870
Please give me a tissue.

1253
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,300
Thank you.

1254
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:07,880
It was cool.

1255
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,300
It was cool.

1256
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
At the countdown.

1257
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
Yes, it was great.

1258
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,500
You'll definitely see this later, right?

1259
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,320
You'll say, I did a good
job at the countdown.

1260
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,580
Idiot!

1261
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,860
Thank you very much.

1262
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,100
Let's move on.

1263
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,460
You're number 14, right?

1264
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,160
Yes.

1265
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,580
Please introduce yourself.

1266
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,680
Yes.

1267
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm Jun Tsuehiro.

1268
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,780
Until now, you've had a lot of meat dishes,

1269
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,840
so you look very decorative.

1270
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,020
Can you see it? I can see it.

1271
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,720


1272
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,460
Is that so? I don't know.

1273
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:40,461
I don't know.

1274
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,120


1275
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
What do you think?

1276
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,100
What do you think?

1277
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,480
What kind of movies do you watch?

1278
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,676
I watch a lot of movies that get killed.

1279
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,700
That's right.

1280
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,140
Because you are that kind of character.

1281
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,520
Is that so? I think so.

1282
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,280
There are a lot
of movies like that.

1283
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,440
Really?

1284
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,220
Yes.

1285
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,060
A lot of movies get killed.

1286
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,980
A lot of movies get killed by students.

1287
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,880
That's right.

1288
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,160
You are still a sailor
uniform student, aren't you?

1289
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,480
Actually, I have many wives.

1290
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Who are you?

1291
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,340
My name is Isoyama.

1292
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,300
Isoyama?

1293
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:20,760
Yes.

1294
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,620
What do you usually do?

1295
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,640
I usually work as a programmer.

1296
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,380
That's a lie, isn't it?

1297
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,740
What? No, it's true.

1298
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:28,860
No, it's true.

1299
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,220


1300
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,781
You're in the gay video, aren't you?

1301
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
You're in it, aren't you?

1302
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,620
You were in the Sports
Newspaper commercial, weren't you?

1303
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,800
No, I was in the commercial.

1304
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,540
Hey, take it off.

1305
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,940
I want to take it off.

1306
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:47,860
Take it off.

1307
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,460
I want to blur it out.

1308
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,200
Don't blur it out.

1309
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,240
But it's not gay,
is it? No, it's not.

1310
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,680


1311
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:56,300
What are you going to do?

1312
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:57,960
What are you going to do?

1313
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,100
I don't know yet.

1314
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,980
She said you are cute.

1315
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,300
I was so excited when I saw Mary.

1316
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,480
I think she wants to go to the other side.

1317
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,960
I'll do my best not to lose.

1318
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:19,200
Bella, please.

1319
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,000
Look!

1320
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,280
What's that?

1321
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:24,281
Ah!

1322
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,100
I'm putting up with it.

1323
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,380
It's salty.

1324
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,780
Salty.

1325
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,121
How long did you put
up with it? Let's eat.

1326
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,520


1327
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,680
I did it yesterday.

1328
00:54:46,000 --> 00:55:00,890
It's the best.

1329
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,350
You can touch me.

1330
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
Vegetable boy.

1331
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,540
Do you have any habits?

1332
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,960
I like to play with fire.

1333
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:22,040
And I have a big butt.

1334
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,640
Do you have a big
butt? Vegetable boy.

1335
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,600


1336
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,620
I'm touching you.

1337
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,180
I'm touching you.

1338
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,560
You like it, don't
you? Yes, I love it.

1339
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,980


1340
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,860
Don't you want to see Aoyokuba?

1341
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,420
Aoyokuba? Aoyokuba.

1342
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,841
What?

1343
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,125
Aoyokuba?

1344
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,800
This one, too?

1345
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,360
Yes, I want to see it.

1346
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,920
You want to see this one, too?

1347
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yes.

1348
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,140
You are very clean today.

1349
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Yes, I am.

1350
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
Look.

1351
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
Do you want to touch it?

1352
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,700
Yes.

1353
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:02,860
You can touch it.

1354
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:05,980
How is it? It's the best.

1355
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,460


1356
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Can I kiss you?

1357
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
Yes.

1358
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:18,890
I feel so happy.

1359
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,330
I got a tip.

1360
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,540
It feels good.

1361
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:27,710
I think I can drink it.

1362
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,810
Do you want to
drink it? Not yet.

1363
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:31,810


1364
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:32,650
I want to drink it.

1365
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:33,930
But we don't have time.

1366
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,650
Then I'll drink it.

1367
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,130
Can I eat it?

1368
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,990
This is a serious face.

1369
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,170
Great.

1370
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,910
It's getting hard.

1371
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,190
You have one minute. Concentrate.

1372
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,130
Great. It's getting bigger.

1373
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,241
I want to get three shots.

1374
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,510
That's too few! Oh, wow.

1375
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,270


1376
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:12,390
Three shots are fine.

1377
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,340
I'm getting bigger.

1378
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:42,880
Go for it!

1379
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,170
It's over!

1380
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,160
Why didn't you
get it? I got bigger.

1381
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,500


1382
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,200
Shut up!

1383
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:58,920
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! I'm sorry.

1384
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,160


1385
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,800
You've grown up so much.

1386
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,440
You're right.

1387
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,020
I'm so sorry. Thank you so much.

1388
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,960
I'll show you later.

1389
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,080
I still have more.

1390
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,620
Next is No.7.

1391
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,440
Please introduce yourself.

1392
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,100
I'm Mori Hinako, who loves Emo-kun.

1393
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,820
How many Oden did you eat?

1394
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,080
How many Oden did you eat?

1395
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,940
Hundreds of Oden.

1396
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,340
In how many
years? About 3 years.

1397
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,080


1398
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,720
Do you have any memorable shooting?

1399
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,480
I love to attack.

1400
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,220
You love to lick.

1401
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,230
I love to lick.

1402
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,740
I love to be licked.

1403
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,200
Today is good, isn't it?

1404
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,180
Can I lick a lot?

1405
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,320
I want you to lick a lot.

1406
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:49,761
I want you to teach me how to do it.

1407
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,820
Please teach me how to do it.

1408
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,480
I forgot how to do it.

1409
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,440
You forgot, didn't you?

1410
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,790
I'll look it up on the Internet.

1411
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,240
I'll look it up on the Internet.

1412
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,900
I'll look it up on Wikipedia.

1413
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,020
Yusuke-san, Kousuke-san.

1414
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,120
Kousuke-san.

1415
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,440
What do you do for a living?

1416
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,980
I work in the construction industry.

1417
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,340
So, you're like, Wasshoi!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

1418
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,380
I do that too,

1419
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,340
but I'm more of a manager.

1420
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,820
Oh, that's cool.

1421
00:59:15,821 --> 00:59:16,200
It's good, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1422
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,580
I see.

1423
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,660


1424
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,081
Then, let's start the Pilates.

1425
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:20,440
Yes.

1426
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,100
Here we go.

1427
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,820
Here we go.

1428
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:26,480
Mori-san, what is your specialty?

1429
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:28,710
I'll show you now.

1430
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:29,660
Wow!

1431
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,080
Cool! I'll show you.

1432
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
I'll show you.

1433
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,500
Cool!

1434
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:35,760
Cool!

1435
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,476
I'll show you from the top to the bottom.

1436
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,500
Then, let's see.

1437
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,160
Let's see.

1438
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:40,161
Let's do it together.

1439
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,740
This is the point.

1440
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,900
The posture is different.

1441
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,560
She walks slowly.

1442
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,630
Look at this.

1443
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,720
It is possible to crush a
bullet bag with this leg.

1444
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,060
It is true that it is thin.

1445
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,300
It is amazing.

1446
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,920
It is really amazing.

1447
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,810
You like it.

1448
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,720
What? It's so hot.

1449
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,700


1450
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,100
I'm so excited in this situation.

1451
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,450
What are you going to do?

1452
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,860
What are you going
to do? It's so hot.

1453
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,040


1454
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,140
You have a cute face.

1455
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,840
Your penis is purple.

1456
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,460
You have a cute face.

1457
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,640
It's so hot.

1458
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,600
It's so hot.

1459
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,100
Is it possible to fire? Maybe.

1460
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,040
Don't bite it.

1461
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,460


1462
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,160
If you bite it, the game is over.

1463
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
Don't take it out.

1464
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:37,940
I want to see it.

1465
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,280
Wow, it's so red.

1466
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:43,395
It's fresh.

1467
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,460
It's fresh, isn't
it? It's fluffy.

1468
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,980


1469
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,580
This is a good one.

1470
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:55,000
This is the first time I've seen this.

1471
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,800
This is surprisingly good.

1472
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,740
It's cute. It's dry.

1473
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,900
It's been a minute.

1474
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,560
You can do it.

1475
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,480
Concentrate.

1476
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,080
Close your eyes.

1477
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,060
How is it? It feels good.

1478
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,820


1479
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,640
How many places have
you been in the history?

1480
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,140
I've been in the first place.

1481
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:37,770
It's a problem if
you're in the third place.

1482
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,380
You have to be in the third place.

1483
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,460
You're noisy.

1484
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,860
I'm noisy, aren't I?

1485
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,189
I'd like you to write a
comment in the corner

1486
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,780
where you were
mixed up with the voice.

1487
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,060
There's a tap later.

1488
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,440
It's a corner to get a chicken tail.

1489
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,700
30 seconds left.

1490
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,960
You want a band, don't you?

1491
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,060
10 seconds left.

1492
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:24,900
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Time's up!

1493
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,220
We couldn't make it.

1494
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,800
I'm sorry.

1495
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,840
We had limited time.

1496
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
And it was noisy.

1497
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
Sorry.

1498
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,040
I know.

1499
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,600
It was noisy.

1500
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,360
I didn't mean it in a weird way.

1501
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,100
This is how it is.

1502
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,220
Thank you very much.

1503
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,540
Thank you very much.

1504
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:48,980
Thank you very much.

1505
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1506
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,140
Please introduce yourself.

1507
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,700
I'm Hana Himesaki from I Cup.

1508
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,780
It's been a long time.

1509
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,380
Can you show me your chest?

1510
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,840
My voice?

1511
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,200
It's coming out a little.

1512
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,480
It's okay. Just show it.

1513
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,860
It's huge!

1514
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,120
You can put a lot of things in here.

1515
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,240
You can put your phone in here.

1516
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,180
It's convenient.

1517
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,760
It's amazing.

1518
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,860
You can put your phone in here.

1519
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
No, you can't.

1520
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,820
I want to see it.

1521
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,680
You can enjoy it later.

1522
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,760
I want to see it now.

1523
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,080
No, I can't. I'm not that kind of person.

1524
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,900
You're strict.

1525
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,360
What do you usually do, Kin-san?

1526
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,160
I'm a construction worker.

1527
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,080
So you're his subordinate?

1528
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:57,940
No, it's our first meeting.

1529
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,180
Yes, it's our first meeting.

1530
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,900
But we might be related in the future.

1531
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,780
So you'll be his subordinate.

1532
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:06,850
Let's go.

1533
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,640
We're almost there.

1534
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Let's go.

1535
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,981
You are taking off
your clothes by yourself.

1536
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,260
Are you ready? Let's start.

1537
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,060


1538
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,280
Take off your clothes quickly.

1539
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,460
Go for it! I'm in trouble.

1540
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,760
I'm in trouble.

1541
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,820
Excuse me.

1542
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000


1543
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,160
How many times are you
going to take off your clothes?

1544
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,400
But I heard that Hamedori is really cool.

1545
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,680
I want to go to Hamedori 8.

1546
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,420
Where? 8 means 5.

1547
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,000


1548
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:44,900
I want to go to Hamedori 15.

1549
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,640
Then, let's go to Hamedori 15.

1550
01:05:47,755 --> 01:05:49,276
What about Hamedori 15 and Hamedori 8?

1551
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,940
Do you often go to Hamedori?

1552
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,280
In private?

1553
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,500
Yes, in private.

1554
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,080
I heard that you are very confident.

1555
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,620
Only Hamedori?

1556
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,240
Yes, only Hamedori.

1557
01:06:00,315 --> 01:06:02,140
Maasa doesn't sell it, does she?

1558
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,070
She doesn't sell it.

1559
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,880
She keeps it in her personal computer.

1560
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,560
Did you wash it
thoroughly? Yes, I did.

1561
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,500


1562
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,120
It's peeling off.

1563
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,160
It's cute, isn't it?

1564
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,000
It's cute, but it's cute.

1565
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,500
I don't want you to think I'm
smelly, so I wash it thoroughly.

1566
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,580
Can I kiss you? Please.

1567
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,310


1568
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,180
I'm going to help you, Hime-chan.

1569
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,340
Oh, my gosh!

1570
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:32,940
It's a special service.

1571
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:36,300
I'm going to touch your neck.

1572
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,320
It's a special service.

1573
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,030
Oh, it's getting bigger.

1574
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,040
Wow!

1575
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:50,041
Wow!

1576
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:53,910
It's getting stronger.

1577
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,180
It's true.

1578
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:02,260
It's hard.

1579
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,580
It's full of meat.

1580
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,340
Isn't it great?

1581
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,730
You can take it out.

1582
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,050
1 minute left.

1583
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,620
You are fast.

1584
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:30,940
I'm fast.

1585
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,500
But it is not a wind.

1586
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,180
Look, look, look.

1587
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,640
It is not a wind.

1588
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,780
It is a great pin.

1589
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,580
It is a great pin.

1590
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,940
It is long.

1591
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,200
It is a great pin.

1592
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:39,720
Isn't it?

1593
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:40,300
It is a great pin.

1594
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,680
It is long.

1595
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,520
Will you be happy?

1596
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,240
It is easy to take a picture of Hame-shiro.

1597
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:50,321
It's easy to say, isn't it?

1598
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
You can say, like, I'm in it.

1599
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:53,600


1600
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,380
That's the point, isn't it?

1601
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:55,900
Hey, you! I love you.

1602
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,280
Oh, my God.

1603
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,340


1604
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,160
You've been doing a lot of work lately.

1605
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
Your nipples feel good,
don't they? I love you.

1606
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,840


1607
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,160
I'm leaving it to you.

1608
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
I've only done two shots.

1609
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,540
The director said he wanted
to shoot the launch scene.

1610
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:10,880
Because? Yes, you.

1611
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:11,740


1612
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,800
You want to eat,
don't you? I love you.

1613
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,020


1614
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,230
If it's 10 seconds left, close
your eyes and concentrate!

1615
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:41,360
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, time's up!

1616
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:44,220
Wow! It was so close!

1617
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,400
I wish I had a little more time.

1618
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,540
I'm sorry.

1619
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,500
I didn't mean to roll it up.

1620
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,500
I didn't roll it up at all.

1621
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,040
Thank you so much.

1622
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,141
We still have a lot of time.

1623
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,800
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

1624
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,560
We've been waiting for so long.

1625
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,800
Are you angry? I'm angry.

1626
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,880
I've been waiting for so long.

1627
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,960
I'm sorry.

1628
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,151
Please introduce yourself.

1629
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:13,960
Hello. I'm Sumire Kuramoto,
the best go-mon in Japan.

1630
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,920
Nice to meet you.

1631
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,600
I'm curious. Where is go-mon?

1632
01:09:20,425 --> 01:09:21,586
Go-mon is in Oman prefecture.

1633
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:22,560
Is it crowded? Yes, it is.

1634
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,160


1635
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,160
Do you sometimes feel pain when
you insert a go-mon? Yes, I do.

1636
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,880


1637
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,500
I want to see it.

1638
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:34,501
I want to see it.

1639
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
I want to see it.

1640
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,860
I don't know what to do.

1641
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,340
It's not a joke.

1642
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,180
I want to see it.

1643
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,460
You want to see it, don't you?

1644
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,380
You want to do image training, don't you?

1645
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,380
How rough it is.

1646
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:49,460
It's a lie.

1647
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,360
It's rough.

1648
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,920
It's true.

1649
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:56,830
It's amazing.

1650
01:09:59,965 --> 01:10:00,820
Who are you? Hi, I'm Yu.

1651
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:01,821


1652
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:02,780
What do you do
usually? I'm a flutter.

1653
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:03,780


1654
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,440
Flutter?

1655
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,300
Yes.

1656
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,001
What's the reason for coming here today?

1657
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,360
I'm going to launch it.

1658
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,540
Let's launch it!

1659
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,620
You have to launch it.

1660
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:12,880
You have to launch it.

1661
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:13,220
You have to launch it.

1662
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,000
You have to launch it.

1663
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:14,980
Take off your clothes.

1664
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,400
Take off your clothes.

1665
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:16,561
Please take off your clothes.

1666
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,520
It's getting hot.

1667
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,900
You said you couldn't stand up.

1668
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,860
What? Show me.

1669
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,340
Show me.

1670
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,400
Cute.

1671
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,060
So cute!

1672
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,200
So cute!

1673
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,160
It's a little bit hard.

1674
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,840
Right?

1675
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,660
Are you still nervous?

1676
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,920
They are kissing.

1677
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,381
They stand up right away when they kiss.

1678
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,480
Look!

1679
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,920
It's so big!

1680
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,520
It's so big! I like it.

1681
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,960
Isn't it great?

1682
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,340
I don't like it.

1683
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,210
Please lick it.

1684
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,760
Please do more.

1685
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,060
Please lick it.

1686
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,290
OK.

1687
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
How do you feel? I feel good.

1688
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:27,870


1689
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,270
How do you feel?

1690
01:11:31,925 --> 01:11:32,710
Please explain in detail.

1691
01:11:32,711 --> 01:11:34,391
When I touch it, I feel a little tingling.

1692
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:37,780
Is it warm? Yes, it is.

1693
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,290
Is it soft?

1694
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,370
Yes, it feels good.

1695
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:44,290
It hurts.

1696
01:11:50,915 --> 01:11:51,915
It is good.

1697
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,550
It has become very hard.

1698
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,611
What kind of Ferro do you like?

1699
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,070
Sakippo?

1700
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,350
Sakippo?

1701
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:09,810
What kind of Ferro do you like?

1702
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,710
Ferro Ferro?

1703
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,210
Ferro Ferro?

1704
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,270
Oh, you like Ferro Ferro.

1705
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:18,570
Is it spicy? It's hot.

1706
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,120
It's good.

1707
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,750


1708
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,930
If you eat too much,
you'll get a stomachache.

1709
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:37,790
Really?

1710
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,820
You'll get a stomachache.

1711
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,011
What are you thinking about?

1712
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,380
I'm thinking about something pleasant.

1713
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,620
It's very hard.

1714
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,720
It's hard, isn't it?

1715
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,620
If I can't get it out with
this, I'll be in trouble.

1716
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,120
Don't be scared.

1717
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,370
10 seconds left.

1718
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:40,710
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1719
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:41,810
Time's up! I'm sorry.

1720
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,030
I didn't mean to rush you.

1721
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,010
I think it was too late.

1722
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,110
I thought it was going to come out.

1723
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:51,710
Because it was squeezed.

1724
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,150
I told you not to rush.

1725
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,170
It's noisy.

1726
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:56,710
I told you 10 seconds left.

1727
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,981
I wanted to do it a little more.

1728
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:01,490
It's noisy.

1729
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,870
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

1730
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:04,570
Thank you very much.

1731
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:05,150
Thank you very much.

1732
01:14:05,151 --> 01:14:06,670
Yay! Yay!

1733
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,350
It's the last one!

1734
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:12,110
It's the last one!

1735
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:13,470
I knew it!

1736
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,230
I knew it!

1737
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,130
This is the time!

1738
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,430
This is the time!

1739
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,170
This is the time!

1740
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:19,730
This is the time!

1741
01:14:19,731 --> 01:14:20,050
Wait, don't eat
it! This is good.

1742
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:21,270


1743
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,490
It's the last one!

1744
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,850
Then, you can lick it.

1745
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,091
Please introduce yourself
and look at the camera.

1746
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:30,090
I'm Tomirakako, and I'm in
the sixth grade of high school.

1747
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:31,830
I'm so excited.

1748
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,830
I'll put it in the video.

1749
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:37,870
Thank you.

1750
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:40,390
It's Icchan's.

1751
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,790
It's a collaboration.

1752
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:46,970
It's a collaboration, right?

1753
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,730
I heard it before.

1754
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,250
If you make a noise here,
a lot of it will come out.

1755
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:55,490
It's good for the lungs.

1756
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,731
I heard that it's easy to jump.

1757
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,750
Then, you will jump a lot, right?

1758
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,470
Wow, there is a lot of sugar in it.

1759
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:07,790
It's amazing.

1760
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,431
I feel like I'm on a business trip.

1761
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,930
Yes.

1762
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,830
Right?

1763
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,750
I can't stop eating it.

1764
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:17,270
It's like a horse sashimi.

1765
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,531
It's a little dirty, so I'll wipe my butt.

1766
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:24,950
Oh, really?

1767
01:15:24,951 --> 01:15:29,550
Do you have the inspection form?

1768
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:30,430
What?

1769
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:31,930
Do you have the inspection
form? Of course I do.

1770
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,730
Then, please touch it.

1771
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,170
I even showed you my buttocks.

1772
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,821
I know you have a lot of fangs.

1773
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,290
I'm white.

1774
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,291
It's true.

1775
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,510
It's noisy.

1776
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,850
I can't do it well.

1777
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,990
I can't do it well.

1778
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,730
Kajitsu-san.

1779
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:04,810
I can't do it well.

1780
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,830
Do you exercise? No, I don't.

1781
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,410
You don't, do you?

1782
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,050
It's totally different.

1783
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:11,930
It's written as Bunkeidanshi.

1784
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:13,291
It was written in the answer note.

1785
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,110
The king kaza of king
kaza does not fire at all.

1786
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,110
Let's fire.

1787
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,150
Let's fire.

1788
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,450
Let's dance.

1789
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,990
Let's do a katsu dance.

1790
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,790
I want to see.

1791
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,990
I want to see.

1792
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,650
I want to see.

1793
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:29,210
I also want to see.

1794
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,710
I want to see.

1795
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,070
Let me see.

1796
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:36,810
I'm going to dance, if you clap your hands.

1797
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,890
I think you are doing small things inside.

1798
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,030
Could you tell me what you are doing?

1799
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,890
You are doing small things.

1800
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,090
My body is spinning.

1801
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:57,090
Your body is spinning.

1802
01:16:57,091 --> 01:16:59,650
You are moving with
a small body skillfully.

1803
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,870
Don't move your body.

1804
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,770
It's difficult, isn't it?

1805
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:11,350
It's hot, isn't it?

1806
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,090
Don't take it off.

1807
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:21,050
Take it off.

1808
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,510
Let's take it off.

1809
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,250
It's thin.

1810
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,550
Wow!

1811
01:17:39,995 --> 01:17:49,370
You have only one minute left.

1812
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,270
One minute!

1813
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:55,470
If you can't make it, you
may be forced to return it.

1814
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:57,170
I can do it!

1815
01:17:57,171 --> 01:17:58,171
You can do it!

1816
01:17:58,830 --> 01:17:59,830
You can do it!

1817
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:06,250
You want to be a representative, don't you?

1818
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,020
Let's drink it!

1819
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:09,630
Let's drink it!

1820
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,250
Right?

1821
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:16,286
You are trying so hard, but you can't.

1822
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,790
I don't know, Kin-Kin.

1823
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:50,810
10 seconds left.

1824
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:54,150
Decide.

1825
01:18:54,430 --> 01:19:05,690
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1826
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:06,350
Time's up!

1827
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:07,470
Argh!!

1828
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:08,910
OMG!

1829
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,250
I feel bad for the producer
who hit the countdown.

1830
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,370
We've waited for so long.

1831
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,630
It's just so-so.

1832
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,270
I want to go home!

1833
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,230
Let's change the balls now.

1834
01:19:30,231 --> 01:19:31,231
I can't believe it.

1835
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:34,190
I can't believe it.

1836
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,750
I'm so sad.

1837
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,490
It's just the beginning.

1838
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,150
It's just the beginning.

1839
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:39,990
It's just the beginning.

1840
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,990
That's all.

1841
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,210
Thank you very much.

1842
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,030
That's all.

1843
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:48,590
That's all.

1844
01:19:48,591 --> 01:20:12,281
BAKOBASU BAKOBASU

1845
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:24,560
BAKOBASU I can't
wait any longer.

1846
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:29,140
Why don't we have sex together?

1847
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,120
Let's start seat belt high-speed sex.

1848
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,260
First of all, please give me a kiss.

1849
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,440
Kiss.

1850
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:48,960
This is the first time for me.

1851
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,340
She is very active.

1852
01:20:52,620 --> 01:21:33,940
Are you looking
at me? Look at me.

1853
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,560


1854
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,540
Are you looking at me?

1855
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,930
Are you looking at
me? Look down more.

1856
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:38,520


1857
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,480
She is happy to see me.

1858
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:01,490
Look down more.

1859
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,730
She is happy to see me.

1860
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,440
How do you feel?

1861
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,800
Next is a man's nipples.

1862
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,860
It's nipples.

1863
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,300
You said it was weak, but it's nipples.

1864
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:21,920
Is it weak?

1865
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,180
Yes.

1866
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:40,480
I'm looking forward to it.

1867
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,920
I love it.

1868
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,700
Long time no see.

1869
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,140
Do you like Chiku-kun?

1870
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,120
I love Chiku-kun.

1871
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,260
Do you love her? Yes, I do.

1872
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,440


1873
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,560
Wow! What a nice Kana!

1874
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,540
You are so sexy!

1875
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,920
Are you wearing it? Yes, I am.

1876
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,300
Be big.

1877
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,380
Take this.

1878
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,700


1879
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:37,480
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

1880
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,680


1881
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:40,870
She is already taking it.

1882
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,580
She is holding it.

1883
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,400
She is fast.

1884
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,740
Good morning!

1885
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:58,700
Good morning!

1886
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,800
You are getting stiff.

1887
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,380
Look at her licking.

1888
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:29,890
How is your neck?

1889
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,330
It feels so good.

1890
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:34,070
Does it?

1891
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:49,710
Do you want to kiss?

1892
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:22,800
It's so shiny, isn't it?

1893
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:36,990
Chikubi is standing up.

1894
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,130
He is purring.

1895
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,410
He is purring for the first time.

1896
01:27:45,835 --> 01:27:47,070
He has a cute voice.

1897
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,050
Do you feel good?

1898
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,500
Chikubi is standing up.

1899
01:28:23,501 --> 01:28:24,501
I'm scared.

1900
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:28,640
You may lose your nipple.

1901
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,820
You have a cute face.

1902
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:59,570
Do you feel this
nipple? It's gone.

1903
01:29:06,605 --> 01:29:09,750


1904
01:29:14,105 --> 01:29:36,240
Oh, this is good.

1905
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:40,460
Next, put your boobs on your face.

1906
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:42,960
Boobs?

1907
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,580
I've never seen boobs.

1908
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:48,660
I'll take this off.

1909
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,020
Boobs.

1910
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,560
What should I do? I'll show you.

1911
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,620
I'm so happy.

1912
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,260


1913
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,140
Ta-da!

1914
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,160
Can I take it off? Sure.

1915
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,360


1916
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:23,700
You are so active.

1917
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,100
Awesome.

1918
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:29,540
I'm nervous.

1919
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:08,710
It's soft.

1920
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,200
Is it painful?

1921
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,500
Painful?

1922
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:19,800
Kuruchi? Don't fail.

1923
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:36,990
I'll push you.

1924
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:48,770
I'll hug you.

1925
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:58,290


1926
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:25,050
I can't show you my eyes.

1927
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,170
Do you want to do
it again? Let's go.

1928
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:30,610


1929
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:34,890
How many seconds do I have to do it?

1930
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:38,550
I don't have boobs, but
I'm going to push you.

1931
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:43,950
I don't have boobs, but
I'm going to push you.

1932
01:32:43,951 --> 01:32:44,951
I'm going to push you.

1933
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:46,510
I can push you.

1934
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:55,610
I can push you.

1935
01:32:57,290 --> 01:32:58,410
I can push you.

1936
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:01,470
I can push you.

1937
01:33:01,471 --> 01:33:03,070
I can push you.

1938
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:03,250
I can push you.

1939
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:03,570
I can push you.

1940
01:33:03,571 --> 01:33:03,650
I can push you.

1941
01:33:03,651 --> 01:33:03,710
I can push you.

1942
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:04,711
I can push you.

1943
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,430
I can push you.

1944
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:06,910
I can push you.

1945
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:08,710
I can push you.

1946
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:09,970
I can push you.

1947
01:33:09,971 --> 01:33:10,010
I can push you.

1948
01:33:10,011 --> 01:33:10,170
I can push you.

1949
01:33:10,171 --> 01:33:13,730
I can push you.

1950
01:33:13,731 --> 01:33:15,850
What's wrong with you? You're so cute!

1951
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:21,540
What?

1952
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:25,120
I want to see the baby.

1953
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,180
It feels so good.

1954
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:34,100
Do you like a
big baby? I love it.

1955
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,160
What? I love it.

1956
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,600


1957
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:38,820
I want to touch it.

1958
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:41,980
I want to touch it so much.

1959
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,180
I'm so happy.

1960
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,120
What is this?

1961
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:09,620
Are you licking my nipple?

1962
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,540
You are so cute.

1963
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,860
Are you licking my nipple?

1964
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Did you lick it? Yes, I did.

1965
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,880


1966
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,240
Is it good?

1967
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:34,480
Do you want
to try it? I'll try it.

1968
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,480


1969
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,280
Are you ready?

1970
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,440
Look!

1971
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,240
Wow!

1972
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,160
Wow!

1973
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:16,320
Wow!

1974
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,180
Wow!

1975
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,300
Look!

1976
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,820
Wow!

1977
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:43,020
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

1978
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,120
Look at me.

1979
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,180
Do you want me to kiss you?

1980
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:28,190
3,2,1

1981
01:36:28,191 --> 01:36:30,150
It came out!

1982
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:33,110
It came out!

1983
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:35,050
It came out! With this.

1984
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,390
..

1985
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,710
1,2,3 We are very sorry
for the inconvenience.

1986
01:36:40,711 --> 01:36:42,490
We will continue the training.

1987
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,980
I'm going to be a right-handed person.

1988
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,120
Can I observe you?

1989
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,760
Can you drink it?

1990
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,480
What?

1991
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,100
Oh, no!

1992
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,520
Go! Go!

1993
01:37:41,205 --> 01:37:42,940
It's the first step to the second step!

1994
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:46,040
It's broken!

1995
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:52,720
Is it beautiful?

1996
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,120
How is it?

1997
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,960
Beautiful?

1998
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,700
I want to go to that side.

1999
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,250
Can I drink it? Yes, you can.

2000
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:07,790
Thank you.

2001
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:20,880
Thank you.

2002
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:29,970


2003
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:31,690
Can I drink it? Yes, you can.

2004
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:33,610
Thank you.

2005
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:36,090
Thank you.

2006
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:37,890


2007
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:50,780
This is the first time to
see a dog without a mosaic.

2008
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,240
Donte, are you licking it?

2009
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:55,620
Donte is observing the dog.

2010
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:57,740
He is licking it.

2011
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,240
This part is curly.

2012
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,280
He is licking it with his tongue.

2013
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:04,600
Is it beautiful? Yes, it is.

2014
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,660


2015
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:08,270
Be careful not to hurt your eyes.

2016
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,240
Good boy.

2017
01:43:39,220 --> 01:44:37,820
I'm sorry for the delay.

2018
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,720
Please use the ferry.

2019
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:43,300
It's too early.

2020
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:44,700
I'm sorry.

2021
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,520
It's too early.

2022
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,180
I'm going to go again.

2023
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,900
It's too early.

2024
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:53,800
It's too early.

2025
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,040
Wait.

2026
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:56,041
Do you want to eat more?

2027
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,160
Do you want to drink Nagamon juice?

2028
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,680
Nagamon juice is full!

2029
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,830
Nagamon juice is full!

2030
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:27,110
Nagamon juice is
full! It's delicious.

2031
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:30,460
It's delicious.

2032
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:53,080


2033
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:06,950
Do you like it?

2034
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:28,480
What are you looking
at? It feels good.

2035
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:37,270


2036
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:48,840
From the beginning?

2037
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:11,830
It's harder than before.

2038
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:16,270
It's quite hard, isn't
it? It feels good.

2039
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,790


2040
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,010
Is it heavy? It feels good.

2041
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:26,810
It's so good.

2042
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:41,090


2043
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,560
Do you feel good?

2044
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,240
You look like a girl
when you open your legs.

2045
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,640
Really?

2046
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,300
You look like an MC.

2047
01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:22,640
Don't make such a painful face.

2048
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,720
Oh, no.

2049
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:29,160
What?

2050
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:30,161
What? Don't move.

2051
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,500
It's a public office.

2052
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:35,360
It's so tight.

2053
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,440
It's so cute.

2054
01:49:08,830 --> 01:49:09,830
Don't do that.

2055
01:49:10,410 --> 01:50:21,620
She is No.7. She looks very comfortable.

2056
01:50:21,621 --> 01:50:22,621
It looks so good.

2057
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,360
Do you want to have sex? Oh, no.

2058
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,660


2059
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:04,840
Do you want to have sex?

2060
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,220
Do you want to have sex?

2061
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,320
I'll do it for you.

2062
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,620
I'll do it quickly.

2063
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:17,340
What?

2064
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,360
I'll do it quickly.

2065
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:18,800
Quickly.

2066
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,780
Do you want to do it with someone else?

2067
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,700
Who do you want to
do it with? Mizuki-san.

2068
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,760


2069
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:29,020
Mizuki-san?

2070
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,120
Can I play with
her? I made a wish.

2071
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:33,020


2072
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:34,590
Isn't it too early?
She is my fan.

2073
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:36,020
That's right.

2074
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:40,180
Betrayer.

2075
01:51:40,181 --> 01:51:45,540
You are a cheater! You are a pervert!

2076
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:49,500
I want to wear a condom.

2077
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:54,040
I'm going to wear a condom.

2078
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:18,410
I'm going to wear it.

2079
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:20,460
Let's put it in.

2080
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:22,270
Wait, let's put it in quickly.

2081
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:25,230
It's from the back.

2082
01:52:27,150 --> 01:52:28,270
It's easy to take a picture.

2083
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:30,150
It's for the back, please.

2084
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:33,990
I'll put it in.

2085
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,330
It's a wonderful sight.

2086
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:41,390
Please check it and see
if it fits well to the root.

2087
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:43,490
Please put it in properly.

2088
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:50,610
It's in!

2089
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:54,130
Great!

2090
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:57,110
It's a great sight.

2091
01:52:58,410 --> 01:52:59,410
Let's go! It's in.

2092
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:05,610


2093
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:10,750
Let's put it in.

2094
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:13,070
Great!

2095
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:15,530
It's a great sight.

2096
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,550
It's wonderful.

2097
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:27,760
How is it?

2098
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:32,760
It's narrow, isn't it?

2099
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:34,460
You don't have to play with it.

2100
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:49,160
Not yet.

2101
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:56,530
Have you graduated as a virgin?

2102
01:53:57,630 --> 01:54:00,910
Have you graduated as a virgin?

2103
01:54:00,911 --> 01:54:02,271
Did you graduate from
high school? No, I didn't.

2104
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:06,390
Don't worry.

2105
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:18,450


2106
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,080
Did you graduate from
high school? No, I didn't.

2107
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,420


2108
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,820
Did you graduate from
high school? No, I didn't.

2109
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,780


2110
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:41,170
Great!

2111
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:46,010
It's coming out!

2112
01:54:46,011 --> 01:54:47,011
It's coming out!

2113
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:50,430
It came out!

2114
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:52,610
Look!

2115
01:54:53,110 --> 01:54:54,110
Oh no!

2116
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,230
One more time!

2117
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,810
One more time!

2118
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:01,850
This is no good!

2119
01:55:01,990 --> 01:55:05,030
It's coming out again!

2120
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:06,390
It's coming out!

2121
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,590
It's coming out!

2122
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:11,990
I can't do it anymore!

2123
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:13,030
I can't do it anymore!

2124
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:18,070
One more time, one more time.

2125
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:18,490
Push.

2126
01:55:18,491 --> 01:55:20,510
I'm sleepy.

2127
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:35,030
More please.

2128
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:38,890
Oh, no.

2129
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:45,710
I can't move.

2130
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:50,290
This is a wonderful picture.

2131
01:55:58,310 --> 01:56:00,630
Now, let's have a face-to-face meeting.

2132
01:56:07,360 --> 01:57:03,470
We are going to start the meeting now.

2133
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,570
We are going to start the meeting now.

2134
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,920
I just got in.

2135
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:16,900
Congratulations.

2136
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,000
Congratulations.

2137
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,240
Congratulations.

2138
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:34,960
Is it warm?

2139
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:37,860
Feels good?

2140
01:58:38,780 --> 01:58:40,240
Congratulations.

2141
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,480
What is it?

2142
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:46,820
It's a seat belt.

2143
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:49,320
OK, everyone.

2144
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:50,860
Let's have a face-to-face meeting.

2145
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:03,360
This pervert.

2146
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,980
Be happy.

2147
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,220
It's dangerous.

2148
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:28,350
This time, we are going to have a
face-to-face meeting, so please be kind to us.

2149
01:59:28,670 --> 01:59:29,670
I'm sorry.

2150
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:30,730
This is a formal meeting.

2151
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:47,300
Did you get it? Let me see.

2152
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,020
It's true.

2153
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:55,490


2154
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:15,560
Congratulations!

2155
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,440
Let's give her another round of applause.

2156
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:20,400
It was a wonderful performance.

2157
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:22,100
Congratulations!

2158
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:24,560
Oh, my God!

2159
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:26,220
Oh, my God!

2160
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:27,660
Oh, my God!

2161
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:29,780
Oh, my God!

2162
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:30,700
Oh, my God!

2163
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:31,000
Oh, my God!

2164
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:31,380
Oh, my God!

2165
02:00:31,381 --> 02:00:31,540
Oh, my God!

2166
02:00:31,541 --> 02:00:32,541
Oh, my God!

2167
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,340
Now, let's move on to free sex.

2168
02:00:36,341 --> 02:00:40,480
Please do not take off your seat belts.

2169
02:00:56,180 --> 02:01:01,060
Please continue this happy
moment for three minutes.

2170
02:01:41,890 --> 02:01:44,130
Wow! There are a lot of them!

2171
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,500
I made a mistake.

2172
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:06,990
I'll do it again.

2173
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:04,520
Did you get it? Yes, I did.

2174
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000


2175
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:13,680
Oh, I can't eat this.

2176
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,830
We have one minute left.

2177
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:31,590
One minute left.

2178
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:33,630
Here we go!

2179
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:36,310
Great!

2180
02:03:36,850 --> 02:03:37,850
Standing ovation!

2181
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:39,810
Here we go!

2182
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:40,570
Great!

2183
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:41,850
Here we go!

2184
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:44,130
Should I take it off?

2185
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:45,830
I'm going to take it off.

2186
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:49,790
Here we go!

2187
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:50,170
I got it!

2188
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:51,630
I got it!

2189
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,270
Thank you!

2190
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:04,690
Congratulations!

2191
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:07,070
Congratulations!

2192
02:04:07,071 --> 02:04:07,450
I got it!

2193
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:09,030
I got it!

2194
02:04:10,210 --> 02:04:11,030
I got it!

2195
02:04:11,031 --> 02:04:11,310
I got it!

2196

2366
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:57,100
I'm so happy!

2367
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:00,480
I'm so happy!

2368
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:09,020
Look at me and eat!

2369
02:19:09,021 --> 02:19:10,021
Look at this!

2370
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,220
Oh my god!

2371
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,960
Oh my god!

2372
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,560
Oh my god!

2373
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:21,810
Oh my god!

2374
02:19:21,811 --> 02:19:24,850
I think it's not enough.

2375
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:26,470
Oh my god!

2376
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:27,770
I want all of them!

2377
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:29,950
Oh my god!

2378
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:32,510
Oh my god!

2379
02:19:32,511 --> 02:19:32,910
Oh my god!

2380
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:33,810
Oh my god!

2381
02:19:33,811 --> 02:19:36,950
Oh my god!

2382
02:19:36,951 --> 02:19:37,951
Wow.

2383
02:19:50,430 --> 02:19:54,810
Yuujin, you are looking at me.

2384
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:56,490
You look so happy.

2385
02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:00,770
Please eat some sweets.

2386
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:04,090
It is delicious.

2387
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:08,790
Thank you very much.

2388
02:20:08,950 --> 02:20:10,930
That's all for lunch time.
Thank you very much.

2389

Bakobasu

2394
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:42,425
Now, we are going
to start the production

2395
02:20:42,437 --> 02:20:44,620
presentation of the revival of
BAKKON BAKKON BUS TOUR.

2396
02:20:47,565 --> 02:20:51,960
First of all, I would like to introduce
the actress, Ms. Fumizuki Yayoi.

2397
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:08,564
On behalf of the 16 AV
actresses here, I would

2398
02:21:08,576 --> 02:21:11,460
like to greet you with
a round of applause.

2399
02:21:11,461 --> 02:21:12,820
I would like to introduce myself.

2400
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,010
I'm a movie maker, Moody's.

2401
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:56,130
I'm honored to be here.

2402
02:21:56,131 --> 02:21:59,590
I'm going to make a historical
work that my seniors left behind.

2403
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:03,570
I'm going to make it erotic and cute.

2404
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:24,800
Thank you very much.

2405
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:30,860
There are a lot of congratulatory messages
from actresses who didn't appear this time.

2406
02:22:30,861 --> 02:22:33,449
We have received a
lot of requests, so we will

2407
02:22:33,461 --> 02:22:36,400
introduce only a part of
it due to time constraints.

2408
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,960
Hello to everyone
participating in BAKOBASU.

2409
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:46,160
I'm Arina Arata, and
I'm in charge of Mooding.

2410
02:22:53,130 --> 02:22:55,563
Congratulations to all the
amateur actors who were

2411
02:22:55,575 --> 02:22:58,020
selected from among the
many applicants this time.

2412
02:22:58,570 --> 02:23:00,660
Congratulations to all of you.

2413
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:06,500
I'm so happy to have a one-night-two-days
sex with such a gorgeous AV actress.

2414
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:13,460
I'm so excited when I think that
an AV actor will be born from here.

2415
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:19,780
I'm looking forward to
seeing you in an AV someday.

2416
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,960
Have fun, everyone.

2417
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:28,520
I'm Rina Arata, a member of Moody's.

Congratulations on the
shooting of Bako Bus.

2419
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:40,980
It's fun to travel by bus, isn't it?

2420
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:43,540
I can see everyone's happy faces.

2421
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,340
I'll do my best to be on Bako Bus someday.

2422
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,480

02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:53,920
MIOCHI!

2425
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:07,450
We have received a message in the video,
so please pay attention to the monitor.

2426
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:12,290
Hello to everyone who participated
in the BAKKONBASHI tour.

2427
02:24:13,450 --> 02:24:15,770
I'm Nana Yagi, the lead actress.

2428
02:24:16,910 --> 02:24:19,010
Everyone may be nervous today,

2429
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:23,349
I don't have to say it, but
today, please don't hold back and

2430
02:24:23,361 --> 02:24:25,930
give your passionate feelings
to the actresses over there.

2431
02:24:30,700 --> 02:24:34,870
I also hope that one day I
can have sex with everyone.

2432
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:39,950
Please enjoy it.

2433
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:49,920
I would like to introduce the
actors who will appear in this movie.

2434
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,500
Please.

2435
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:07,320
This movie is called Aim for AV Actors.

2436
02:25:08,415 --> 02:25:10,760
The theme is to train actors.

2437
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:13,960
The cast here are still beginners.

2438
02:25:31,820 --> 02:25:34,380
This time, congratulations on the
revival of BAKO BAKO BUS TOUR!

2439
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:42,840
The most historical work of the best AV
makers in Japan, BAKO BAKO BUS TOUR,

2440
02:25:42,841 --> 02:25:49,920
So, I expect that AV actress
will be more sexy than usual.

2441
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:55,800
Also, I heard that men
want to be like AV actresses.

2442
02:25:57,290 --> 02:26:02,520
So, my advice is... At first, don't think
about difficult things and enjoy sex.

2443
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:05,400
Enjoy!

2444
02:26:05,401 --> 02:26:09,860
So, if this is released,
I will definitely buy it.

2445
02:26:10,940 --> 02:26:12,300
See you again!

2446
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:17,980
Thank you very much.

2447
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:26,680
Let's do our best and aim for
the second place in the first round.

2448
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:30,400
So, before we get into the game,

2449
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:33,880
Let's check the Anaru & Bokki!

2450
02:26:33,881 --> 02:26:35,100
Let's check it out!

2451
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:50,080
No matter how embarrassing the
situation is, you don't have to give up.

2452
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,400
Isn't that right, everyone?

2453
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:53,520
That's right!

2454
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:56,860
Okay, everyone on the second
floor, please take your positions.

2455
02:26:58,525 --> 02:26:59,925
If you want to be a model everyday,

2456
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:11,750
Anal check, start!

2457
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:13,330
Yes! I'm nervous.

2458
02:27:33,790 --> 02:27:34,790


2459
02:27:41,690 --> 02:27:51,620
I've never done this before.

2460
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:54,720
Are you embarrassed? Yes, I am.

2461
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:55,380


2462
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,160
I'm embarrassed, but I'll do my best.

2463
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:00,000
You have to get used to it.

2464
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:01,280
That's right.

2465
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,840
I'll do my best.

2466
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:04,520
OK, let's start.

2467
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:06,140
Pocky check!

2468
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:07,720
Pocky check!

2469
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:11,120
Show me your picture.

2470
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:12,880
I'm not pocky at all.

2471
02:28:13,380 --> 02:28:14,860
Don't do that, Kawaii-chan.

2472
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:24,860
We'll write a letter for you.

2473
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:26,680
Oh, no.

2474
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:28,180
Oh, no.

2475
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:31,560
I have to do it!

2476
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:36,880
You are getting old, Ochinpo!

2477
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:38,100
Let me do it!

2478
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:42,460
You are doing your best!

2479
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:44,360
You are doing your best!

2480
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:46,280
You can do it, Ochinpo!

2481
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,990
Are you holding up?

2482
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:57,570
This is Ochinpo, who
has the qualities of a man.

2483
02:28:58,530 --> 02:29:00,090
Oh, you surprised me!

2484
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:05,440
Yabui-chan!

2485
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:10,700
Oh, you are here again.

2486
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:12,340
You are amazing!

2487
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:13,940
What? It's strange.

2488
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:15,280


2489
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:17,160
What?

2490
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:17,840
What?

2491
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:18,940
Why are you so shy?

2492
02:29:20,290 --> 02:29:23,080
You can't get excited, can you?

2493
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:23,760
Why?

2494
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Why?

2495
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:28,660
Who are you?

2496
02:29:29,255 --> 02:29:30,860
Who are you?

2497
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:33,000
Yoku-san asked me.

2498
02:29:33,001 --> 02:29:34,001
I've got a message.

2499
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:35,360
What is it?

2500
02:29:35,490 --> 02:29:40,200
I have 123,000 followers on SNS.

2501
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:42,560
I have more than 10,000 fans.

2502
02:29:42,830 --> 02:29:43,940
I have 33 fans.

2503
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:46,700
On my birthday, I'm going to make an AV.

2504
02:29:48,050 --> 02:29:50,000
I have more than 10
million followers a month.

2505
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:52,020
I own several luxury cars.

2506
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:54,260
I'm Kaido from Reiwa.

2507
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:55,820
I'm the best disciple of director Samoari.

2508
02:29:55,821 --> 02:29:59,780
He is the best disciple
of Emro, the director.

2509
02:30:01,550 --> 02:30:03,960
He looks like a child, but he is an adult.

2510
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:07,180
His name is Toy Boy Aizawa.

2511
02:30:15,010 --> 02:30:16,110
He is amazing.

2512
02:30:17,630 --> 02:30:18,190
He is amazing.

2513
02:30:18,191 --> 02:30:19,191
Don't be shy.

2514
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:28,800
You have to make him
stand no matter where he is.

2515
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:30,860
Is he standing? No, he is not.

2516
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,720
What are you doing?

2517
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:36,320
Yes, I'm standing.

2518
02:30:57,880 --> 02:31:02,770
What are you doing?

2519
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:05,550
What are you doing?

2520
02:31:05,551 --> 02:31:06,870
We are in the same team.

2521
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:11,170
What are you doing?

2522
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:12,950
What are you doing?

2523
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:14,510
What are you doing?

2524
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:24,320
We are in the same team.

2525
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:41,720
We are in the same team.

2526
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:42,420
We are in the same team.

2527
02:31:42,421 --> 02:31:44,260
What's this?

2528
02:31:45,255 --> 02:31:46,255
What?

2529
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:48,840
You said something very arrogant.

2530
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:50,620
You said you liked me.

2531
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:53,240
Look at this.

2532
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:54,580
I don't like it at all.

2533
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:55,800
I want to see this.

2534
02:31:57,360 --> 02:31:58,360
What?

2535
02:32:04,310 --> 02:32:05,910
Where did you get that
confidence from? What? The most.

2536
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:07,610


2537
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:08,490
..

2538
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:09,491
Wait a minute.

2539
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:11,590
Don't show it to everyone.

2540
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:32,710
Are you sure?

2541
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:41,250
What are you doing?

2542
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:55,170
Hey!

2543
02:32:58,970 --> 02:32:59,930
You can do whatever you want.

2544
02:32:59,950 --> 02:32:59,970
Hey!

2545
02:32:59,971 --> 02:32:59,990
Hey!

2546
02:32:59,991 --> 02:33:00,991
Hey!

2547
02:33:06,090 --> 02:33:06,290
Hey!

2548
02:33:06,291 --> 02:33:11,770
If the male and female
dancers see this, they will say,

2549
02:33:11,771 --> 02:33:15,930
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2550
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:21,450
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2551
02:33:21,451 --> 02:33:23,990
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2552
02:33:24,290 --> 02:33:27,470
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2553
02:33:27,471 --> 02:33:28,150
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2554
02:33:28,151 --> 02:33:30,071
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2555
02:33:30,370 --> 02:33:32,670
「Zen, don't betray the
male and female dancers!」

2556
02:33:32,671 --> 02:33:41,130
「Zen, don't betray the male and
female dancers!」 Don't make me breathe.

2557
02:33:42,850 --> 02:33:43,850
Don't make me breathe.

2558
02:34:03,210 --> 02:34:31,700
What do you want me to do?

2559
02:34:32,210 --> 02:34:33,210
Which one is the nipple?

2560
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:34,700
Nipple!

2561
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:37,000
Please choose the nipple.

2562
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:38,020
Should I eat the nipple?

2563
02:34:38,021 --> 02:34:38,280
What should I do?

2564
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:40,020
I'm not used to it.

2565
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:43,100
I'm scared if you don't tell me.

2566
02:34:43,460 --> 02:34:44,600
Did you break it? I broke it.

2567
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:46,100


2568
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:52,200
I want you to be kind to me.

2569
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:54,780
Please tell everyone.

2570
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:56,480
Please be kind to my nipples.

2571
02:35:07,630 --> 02:35:09,770
Do you feel good?

2572
02:35:09,771 --> 02:35:10,990
I'll do it for you.

2573
02:35:10,991 --> 02:35:15,510
I'll let you lick me.

2574
02:35:21,710 --> 02:35:26,050
I want to lick the commotion.

2575
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:28,710
If you lick the commotion, I'll get実.

2576
02:35:31,970 --> 02:35:38,160
It's getting slightly bigger.

2577
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:39,840
It's awesome.

2578
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:43,440
If you lick Manko, it will grow bigger.

2579
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:05,720
You are good at licking Manko.

2580
02:36:10,115 --> 02:36:12,195
If you can do it, you can
do a lot of erotic things.

2581
02:36:13,740 --> 02:36:15,140
Manko is licking Manko deliciously.

2582
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:19,980
Is it delicious?

2583
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:22,500
Is it delicious?

2584
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:24,020
Is it delicious?

2585
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:25,100
Come here!

2586
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:27,480
Chie-pon is working out.

2587
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:29,080
Chie-pon?

2588
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:30,680
What?

2589
02:36:37,950 --> 02:36:39,270
Chie-pon?

2590
02:36:40,170 --> 02:36:41,170
Chie-pon?

2591
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:42,310
Chie-pon?

2592
02:36:42,311 --> 02:36:43,311
Chie-pon?

2593
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:44,730
Chie-pon?

2594
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:47,350
Chie-pon?

2595
02:36:47,351 --> 02:36:48,690
Give it back!

2596
02:36:50,030 --> 02:36:51,030
Give it back!

2597
02:36:51,870 --> 02:37:03,530
I think you can become an actress.

2598
02:37:05,330 --> 02:37:07,330
I want to be an actress.

2599
02:37:08,670 --> 02:37:09,810
Hey, you.

2600
02:37:11,490 --> 02:37:12,490
You did your best.

2601
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:16,490
But you came here, so you can't do it.

2602
02:37:17,300 --> 02:37:19,310
And you have been out twice.

2603
02:37:19,311 --> 02:37:20,311
I can't do it.

2604
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:28,250
I can't do it. I became an amateur.

2605
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:31,270
You can do it.

2606
02:37:31,271 --> 02:37:33,290
I can't do it.

2607
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:36,110
I can't do it.

2608
02:37:36,190 --> 02:37:37,190
I can't do it.

2609
02:37:37,310 --> 02:37:37,530
I can't do it.

2610
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:38,990
I can't do it.

2611
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:42,870
I can't do it.

2612
02:37:42,930 --> 02:37:46,710
I can't do it.

2613
02:37:48,870 --> 02:37:49,870
I can't do it.

2614
02:37:55,220 --> 02:37:56,040
I can't do it.

2615
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:56,660
I can't do it.

2616
02:37:56,661 --> 02:37:56,680
I can't do it.

2617
02:37:56,681 --> 02:37:56,880
I can't do it.

2618
02:37:56,881 --> 02:38:02,400
It looks like it's coming out.

2619
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:04,440
It's turning red.

2620
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:06,120
It's coming out?

2621
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:08,300
It's amazing, isn't it?

2622
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:14,560
Isn't there anyone named
Waruko-sama? It's so good.

2623
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:27,270
It feels good.

2624
02:38:27,630 --> 02:38:28,630


2625
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:54,570
It's so cute!

2626
02:41:19,610 --> 02:41:20,710
It feels so good!

2627
02:41:21,270 --> 02:41:22,270
It's a butterfly!

2628
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:33,010
It feels so good!

2629
02:41:33,710 --> 02:41:34,710
It's a butterfly!

2630
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:58,400
Go! Go! Go!

2631
02:41:58,580 --> 02:41:59,980
You can do it! You can still do it!

2632
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:36,550
It's amazing!

2633
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:37,970
You can do it!

2634
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:24,960
You did it!

2635
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Thank you!

2636
02:44:19,370 --> 02:44:20,910
Let's go!

2637
02:44:21,470 --> 02:44:55,260
It feels so good!

2638
02:44:55,740 --> 02:44:56,260
It feels so good!

2639
02:44:56,540 --> 02:44:58,700
Can I really do it?

2640
02:45:00,235 --> 02:45:01,540
I can't do it anymore.

2641
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:09,400
What? What?

2642
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:13,000
I can't do it anymore.

2643
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:47,380
Ai-chan, Ai-chan, Ai-chan.

2644
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:08,460
Cute.

2645
02:47:15,380 --> 02:47:25,300
Are you happy? Latte is cute.

2646
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:27,700
I'm scared.

2647
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:36,950


2648
02:47:42,800 --> 02:48:58,090
What is the best thing about the meeting?

2649
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:02,160
The best thing is the student council.

2650
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:04,730
The best thing is the student council?

2651
02:49:05,790 --> 02:49:10,270
Did you kiss her a lot?

2652
02:49:14,570 --> 02:49:34,360
I failed the hair challenge.

2653
02:49:34,361 --> 02:49:35,361
I failed!

2654
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:36,580
You put it on your hair!

2655
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:37,840
What are you talking about?

2656
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:56,970
You can do it!

2657
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:02,150
Can I touch all of your hair later?

2658
02:50:03,290 --> 02:50:04,290
Can I?

2659
02:50:04,550 --> 02:50:05,730
You are so kind!

2660
02:50:14,990 --> 02:50:16,010
Come here!

2661
02:50:17,860 --> 02:50:21,280
Who do you want to play with?

2662
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Who do you like?

2663
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:29,640
Who do you like?

2664
02:50:29,641 --> 02:50:29,700
Who do you like?

2665
02:50:30,220 --> 02:50:31,220
Who do you like?

2666
02:50:31,380 --> 02:50:32,380
Who?

2667
02:50:32,940 --> 02:50:33,980
Can't you choose?

2668
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:36,540
If you can't choose,
you can't take a picture.

2669
02:50:38,090 --> 02:50:39,280
Hurry up.

2670
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:41,300
If you don't choose, you can't put it in.

2671
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:42,680
It's Mori.

2672
02:50:43,000 --> 02:51:02,050
It looks big.

2673
02:51:02,051 --> 02:51:03,051
It looks big.

2674
02:51:15,490 --> 02:51:16,570
You have to look at Morita.

2675
02:51:18,270 --> 02:51:19,510
Look at her eyes.

2676
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:26,590
What are you going to do with your hands?

2677
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:28,690
It's a waste if you don't touch her hands.

2678
02:51:32,510 --> 02:51:33,510
I'm sorry.

2679
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:48,800
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2680
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:56,130
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2681
02:52:56,131 --> 02:53:06,230
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2682
02:53:06,231 --> 02:53:07,666
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2683
02:53:07,690 --> 02:53:09,290
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2684
02:53:09,430 --> 02:53:11,030
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2685
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:15,060
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2686
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:15,240
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2687
02:53:15,241 --> 02:53:15,360
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2688
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:21,080
We are going to have a concert in Tokyo.

2689
02:53:21,081 --> 02:53:22,560
It's a black bird.

2690
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:25,020
But it's big.

2691
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:29,580
Look at it. Look at it carefully.

2692
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:32,460
It's so big.

2693
02:53:33,375 --> 02:53:34,415
Look at it. It's going in.

2694
02:53:34,785 --> 02:53:36,920
It's so cute.

2695
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:39,140
It's going in.

2696
02:53:43,070 --> 02:53:47,740
You want to put it
in, don't you? Please.

2697
02:53:48,140 --> 02:53:48,580


2698
02:53:48,980 --> 02:53:49,400
What?

2699
02:53:49,401 --> 02:53:50,401
What are you doing?

2700
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:53,800
Mori-chan!

2701
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:54,660
Mori-chan!

2702
02:53:54,820 --> 02:53:55,820
Please do it!

2703
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:29,380
Stop it!

2704
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:30,900
Your waist is moving!

2705
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:32,760
Stop it!

2706
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:56,970
Don't look at the handle!

2707
02:54:58,430 --> 02:55:01,540
Look at my eyes!

2708
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:03,020
Look at my eyes!

2709
02:55:03,420 --> 02:55:04,120
Look at my eyes!

2710
02:55:04,121 --> 02:55:04,560
Look at my eyes!

2711
02:55:04,561 --> 02:55:04,840
Look at my eyes!

2712
02:55:04,841 --> 02:55:06,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

2713
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:08,280
It feels good, doesn't it?

2714
02:55:08,281 --> 02:55:08,980
Say it louder!

2715
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:10,300
It feels good, doesn't it?

2716
02:55:10,900 --> 02:55:11,460
Say it louder!

2717
02:55:11,461 --> 02:55:11,840
How do you feel?

2718
02:55:12,360 --> 02:55:13,260
How do you feel? I was scared.

2719
02:55:13,261 --> 02:55:25,690
I was scared.

2720
02:55:27,150 --> 02:55:28,150


2721
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:31,790
How do you feel
now? I feel great.

2722
02:55:37,860 --> 02:55:38,980


2723
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:47,690
Are you going to cry? Not yet.

2724
02:55:48,070 --> 02:55:50,130
Not yet? You are crying.

2725
02:56:06,930 --> 02:56:19,230
I'm worried.

2726
02:56:37,530 --> 02:56:38,530


2727
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:41,930
How do you feel
now? I'm worried.

2728
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:16,850
I'm so happy.

2729
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:29,420
I have a t-shirt.

2730
03:00:29,421 --> 03:00:42,740
I'm free, so I'm wearing this.

2731
03:00:43,240 --> 03:00:45,580
Look at this.

2732
03:00:45,630 --> 03:00:47,060
My butt is in it.

2733
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:22,960
I'm happy to wear it.

2734
03:02:24,060 --> 03:02:25,760
It feels good.

2735
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:34,000
I like it.

2736
03:02:34,001 --> 03:02:35,001
This is the best.

2737
03:03:09,770 --> 03:03:11,400
I have a weak hip strength.

2738
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:55,360
My hips are shaking.

2739
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:31,900
Can I stand up?

2740
03:05:33,170 --> 03:05:34,170
Stand up!

2741
03:06:14,050 --> 03:06:16,120
Look! My hips are shaking.

2742
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:19,220
This is erotic.

2743
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:20,980
This is erotic.

2744
03:06:27,830 --> 03:06:28,780
I can learn a lot.

2745
03:06:28,781 --> 03:06:29,861
There are a lot of monkeys!

2746
03:06:34,320 --> 03:06:35,320
Wow! This is a monkey!

2747
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:37,320
This is a monkey!

2748
03:07:06,200 --> 03:07:09,900
It feels so good!

2749
03:07:29,010 --> 03:07:30,290
Which one do you want
to choose? I don't know.

2750
03:07:30,390 --> 03:07:31,390


2751
03:07:31,610 --> 03:07:32,890
Which one do you want to choose?

2752
03:07:33,990 --> 03:07:34,630
Which one do you want to choose?

2753
03:07:34,631 --> 03:07:34,730

2754
03:07:34,770 --> 03:07:35,090
Which one do you want to choose?

2755
03:07:35,091 --> 03:07:35,150
Which one do you want to choose?

2756
03:07:35,170 --> 03:07:35,210
Which one do you want to choose?

2757
03:07:35,211 --> 03:07:35,410
Which one do you want to choose?

2758
03:07:35,411 --> 03:07:35,530
Which one do you want to choose?

2759
03:07:35,590 --> 03:07:35,650
Which one do you want to choose?

2760
03:07:35,690 --> 03:07:36,906
Which one do you want to choose?

2761
03:07:36,930 --> 03:07:37,210
Which one do you want to choose?

2762
03:07:37,590 --> 03:07:38,870
Which one do you want to choose?

2763
03:07:49,360 --> 03:07:50,640
Which one do you want to choose?

2764
03:07:51,480 --> 03:07:52,760
Which one do you want to choose?

2765
03:07:53,180 --> 03:07:54,460
Which one do you want to choose?

2766
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:56,920
Which one do you want to choose?

2767
03:07:56,921 --> 03:07:59,320
I can't eat it yet.

2768
03:07:59,760 --> 03:11:29,870
It's delicious.

2769
03:11:40,780 --> 03:11:41,940
I'll give it to you.

2770
03:11:51,320 --> 03:11:53,020
Is it really
delicious? Yes, it is.

2771
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:54,320
Let's eat it.

2772
03:11:54,380 --> 03:11:55,380
Let me see.

2773
03:11:56,340 --> 03:11:57,420


2774
03:11:58,210 --> 03:11:59,260
Show me the truth.

2775
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:07,720
I'm going to eat it.

2776
03:12:08,100 --> 03:12:08,680
Go ahead.

2777
03:12:08,681 --> 03:12:29,060
I'm going to take a bath now.

2778
03:13:58,420 --> 03:14:37,420
Mayuko, lie down.

2779
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:38,700
Mayuko, lie down.

2780
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:40,000
Lie down close to me.

2781
03:15:03,980 --> 03:15:06,280
Mayuko, lick me.

2782
03:15:29,890 --> 03:15:42,200
I feel good.

2783
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:55,950
Can you show me again?

2784
03:16:41,580 --> 03:16:43,160
I won't forgive you if you don't decide.

2785
03:16:43,180 --> 03:16:44,000
No, I won't.

2786
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:44,300
Decide!

2787
03:16:44,730 --> 03:16:46,170
If you don't decide, I'll shoot you.

2788
03:18:17,930 --> 03:18:50,600
Oh, no, I'm gonna puke.

2789
03:18:50,880 --> 03:18:52,660
No, you can't.

2790
03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:54,060
I won't give it to you.

2791
03:18:58,120 --> 03:18:59,140
Oh, no, I'm gonna puke.

2792
03:19:34,170 --> 03:19:35,170
Congratulations!

2793
03:21:15,455 --> 03:21:42,810
It was close, wasn't it?

2794
03:21:42,850 --> 03:21:53,970
ばこばっす

2795
03:22:03,010 --> 03:22:34,220
We take off our blindfolds
and introduce ourselves.

2796
03:22:34,870 --> 03:22:36,760
It's a game to see if you
can guess the answer.

2797
03:22:38,220 --> 03:22:44,060
In this Hamehame area, if you are a
beginner, raise your hand and guess.

2798
03:22:54,220 --> 03:22:55,580
Please spread out to all 13 areas.

2799
03:23:01,530 --> 03:23:02,530
What?

2800
03:23:03,530 --> 03:23:03,630
What?

2801
03:23:04,530 --> 03:23:10,690
Do you have enough mangos?

2802
03:23:19,190 --> 03:24:02,150
We heard that you don't have enough mangos.

2803
03:24:02,610 --> 03:24:04,990
So, we are going to support you.

2804
03:24:06,730 --> 03:24:08,610
We are going to help you in Hamehame area.

2805
03:24:15,810 --> 03:24:17,090
You came here to run,
didn't you? Yes, we did.

2806
03:24:17,110 --> 03:24:18,170
I see.

2807
03:24:18,290 --> 03:24:18,830


2808
03:24:19,190 --> 03:24:20,190
Well, it can't be helped.

2809
03:24:20,450 --> 03:24:22,530
If you say so,

2810
03:24:23,770 --> 03:24:25,530
Let's do our best together.

2811
03:24:25,890 --> 03:24:26,890
We'll do our best.

2812
03:24:27,370 --> 03:24:28,370
How is it?

2813
03:24:28,530 --> 03:24:28,790
Are you ready?

2814
03:24:29,370 --> 03:24:29,830
Yes.

2815
03:24:30,170 --> 03:24:31,170
Thank you.

2816
03:24:35,250 --> 03:24:37,910
Then, everyone, let's start
the Peloton Manjin Sports Day.

2817
03:24:39,190 --> 03:24:40,190
Ready, go!

2818
03:24:51,380 --> 03:24:52,780
Are you ready?

2819
03:24:52,781 --> 03:24:53,781
Hello, we are NiziU.

2820
03:25:11,150 --> 03:25:13,070
I don't know what's going on.

2821
03:25:13,310 --> 03:25:14,410
I'm scared.

2822
03:25:14,790 --> 03:25:15,790
I'm scared, too.

2823
03:25:26,110 --> 03:25:28,460
It's like a dental examination.

2824
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:30,080
Wait a minute.

2825
03:25:30,100 --> 03:25:31,100
Don't laugh.

2826
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:45,600
Wow, it's amazing.

2827
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:52,870
Did you touch it?

2828
03:25:55,150 --> 03:25:56,150
This side is better.

2829
03:25:56,870 --> 03:25:59,970
I think it's good.

2830
03:26:04,900 --> 03:26:06,790
It's good.

2831
03:26:09,530 --> 03:26:10,650
That's why I said it's good.

2832
03:26:21,710 --> 03:26:22,850
This is good.

2833
03:26:24,750 --> 03:26:25,750
Are you ready?

2834
03:26:26,690 --> 03:26:27,690
Yes!

2835
03:26:29,570 --> 03:26:31,370
Don't take off your eye mask yet.

2836
03:26:32,690 --> 03:26:36,070
Let's go to bed.

2837
03:26:39,590 --> 03:26:40,590
Did you sleep? Yes, I did.

2838
03:26:40,900 --> 03:26:41,900


2839
03:26:42,240 --> 03:26:43,240
Are you here? Yes, I am.

2840
03:26:43,790 --> 03:26:45,500


2841
03:26:46,140 --> 03:26:47,620
Can I take this off?

2842
03:26:48,260 --> 03:26:49,260
Yes.

2843
03:26:49,380 --> 03:26:50,900
It's so bright.

2844
03:26:52,400 --> 03:26:53,520
Wait a minute.

2845
03:26:54,180 --> 03:26:55,540
Can you see me? Excuse me.

2846
03:26:56,900 --> 03:26:57,900


2847
03:26:58,220 --> 03:26:59,560
Let's check the question mark.

2848
03:27:00,420 --> 03:27:02,200
Let's check the question mark.

2849
03:27:02,680 --> 03:27:04,340
I already know my genius question mark.

2850
03:27:05,300 --> 03:27:06,300
Really?

2851
03:27:06,480 --> 03:27:08,700
I don't know because there is a rubber.

2852
03:27:09,480 --> 03:27:10,600
You don't know?

2853
03:27:11,020 --> 03:27:12,020
It's a password.

2854
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:15,800
But what is it?

2855
03:27:16,120 --> 03:27:17,120
How was it?

2856
03:27:18,320 --> 03:27:20,320
It's hard to understand
because there is a rubber.

2857
03:27:21,100 --> 03:27:22,560
What number is it?

2858
03:27:27,260 --> 03:27:28,260
Mon-chan!

2859
03:27:28,770 --> 03:27:29,270
Difficult!

2860
03:27:29,730 --> 03:27:30,730
4!

2861
03:27:31,870 --> 03:27:32,870
I'm 4!

2862
03:27:33,060 --> 03:27:34,150
I'm 2!

2863
03:27:34,690 --> 03:27:35,690
Wait, I'm really 4.

2864
03:27:36,110 --> 03:27:37,110
Really?

2865
03:27:37,410 --> 03:27:37,750
Really? You're lying.

2866
03:27:38,310 --> 03:27:39,310
I don't know.

2867
03:27:39,450 --> 03:27:40,690


2868
03:27:41,830 --> 03:27:42,830
No.

2869
03:27:42,970 --> 03:27:44,970
Let's change.

2870
03:27:45,290 --> 03:27:46,290
Let's change.

2871
03:27:46,930 --> 03:27:47,930
Which one? Wait.

2872
03:27:50,030 --> 03:27:51,030


2873
03:27:57,120 --> 03:27:59,470
Wait a minute, this
person has a lot of voice.

2874
03:28:02,650 --> 03:28:06,510
Wait a minute, I remember this.

2875
03:28:06,730 --> 03:28:08,610
I don't know.

2876
03:28:10,630 --> 03:28:11,790
I think this is 2.

2877
03:28:12,490 --> 03:28:14,970
Too many 2s.

2878
03:28:14,971 --> 03:28:16,530
Oh my god! 2 and 3.

2879
03:28:17,510 --> 03:28:19,090


2880
03:28:19,250 --> 03:28:20,250
This person is 1.

2881
03:28:20,670 --> 03:28:21,670
This person is 1? 3? 3 and 4.

2882
03:28:22,770 --> 03:28:23,090


2883
03:28:23,730 --> 03:28:24,730


2884
03:28:25,010 --> 03:28:26,010
4! 4! Let's line up.

2885
03:28:26,910 --> 03:28:31,170
Line up.

2886
03:28:31,490 --> 03:28:31,990
Let's stand up.

2887
03:28:32,410 --> 03:28:33,790


2888
03:28:34,210 --> 03:28:35,410
No.1.

2889
03:28:36,910 --> 03:28:37,910
No.1 is here.

2890
03:28:38,190 --> 03:28:39,190
No.1 is here.

2891
03:28:39,350 --> 03:28:40,350
No.2.

2892
03:28:40,590 --> 03:28:42,910
No.3.

2893
03:28:42,911 --> 03:28:43,050
No.3.

2894
03:28:43,570 --> 03:28:43,930
No.4.

2895
03:28:44,090 --> 03:28:45,090
No.5.

2896
03:28:45,550 --> 03:28:46,550
No.6.

2897
03:29:11,140 --> 03:29:13,900
It's already standing, isn't it?
It's stable, isn't it?

2898
03:29:26,210 --> 03:29:27,790
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

2899
03:29:28,700 --> 03:29:29,870


2900
03:29:30,570 --> 03:29:31,970
I feel like my heart is going to pop out.

2901
03:29:31,971 --> 03:29:32,971
Thank you very much.

2902
03:29:40,530 --> 03:29:43,370
Let's do our best, Kana-chan!

2903
03:29:45,490 --> 03:29:47,350
Sexy girls are waiting for you.

2904
03:29:47,830 --> 03:29:48,830
Do your best!

2905
03:29:49,630 --> 03:29:50,710
Are you ready?

2906
03:29:51,030 --> 03:29:52,030
Are you motivated?

2907
03:29:53,350 --> 03:29:54,510
We've arrived at the bedside!

2908
03:29:54,870 --> 03:29:55,870
Let's go!

2909
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:05,280
I'm going to tuck you in.

2910
03:30:20,300 --> 03:30:21,460
I'll hold you tight.

2911
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:24,700
It feels good, doesn't it?

2912
03:30:38,400 --> 03:30:41,030
Hang in there! Hang in there!

2913
03:30:41,450 --> 03:30:43,330
I'll help you a little.

2914
03:30:43,331 --> 03:30:44,331
Let's go!

2915
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:53,380
Wow!

2916
03:30:54,600 --> 03:31:02,200
You got wet, didn't
you? Oh, I'm sorry.

2917
03:31:02,310 --> 03:31:04,420
You got wet.

2918
03:31:16,105 --> 03:31:17,860
Oh, wow! You're so strong!

2919
03:31:18,340 --> 03:31:18,880
Wow!

2920
03:31:19,280 --> 03:32:04,700
Are you OK? Do you want to get better?

2921
03:32:05,400 --> 03:32:07,080
You can do it!

2922
03:32:14,250 --> 03:32:15,250
You are slipping.

2923
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:48,860
I'm going!

2924
03:32:58,190 --> 03:33:14,160
Do you want to win?

2925
03:33:14,480 --> 03:33:15,480
Yes!

2926
03:33:25,410 --> 03:33:27,590
I won! Congratulations!

2927
03:33:27,591 --> 03:33:28,591
I did it!

2928
03:33:39,410 --> 03:33:40,690
I'm so disappointed.

2929
03:33:49,560 --> 03:33:50,940
I did it!

2930
03:33:56,400 --> 03:33:57,400
You have a thick arm.

2931
03:33:59,240 --> 03:34:00,530
Look at the third one.

2932
03:34:05,180 --> 03:34:11,820
It's so close!

2933
03:34:24,970 --> 03:34:26,300
I did it!

2934
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:48,720
You did a good job.

2935
03:34:48,900 --> 03:34:50,010
I'm sweating a lot.

2936
03:34:50,470 --> 03:34:52,010
We did our best.

2937
03:34:53,870 --> 03:34:54,930
We did our best.

2938
03:35:05,580 --> 03:35:07,720
Look, there are four.

2939
03:35:08,240 --> 03:35:09,240
It's great.

2940
03:35:09,680 --> 03:35:13,930
I hope we can have fun.

2941
03:35:17,930 --> 03:35:20,010
Which one?

2942
03:35:29,990 --> 03:35:31,310
The biggest one.

2943
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:32,600
The biggest one.

2944
03:35:32,830 --> 03:35:33,270
It's cute.

2945
03:35:33,271 --> 03:35:35,990
It's a practice game.

2946
03:35:36,190 --> 03:35:37,190
Number one, Piper!

2947
03:35:38,970 --> 03:35:39,970
What else?

2948
03:35:40,350 --> 03:35:42,530
Don't concentrate on the game.

2949
03:35:43,190 --> 03:35:44,930
Kintama is a little stretched.

2950
03:35:45,290 --> 03:35:45,510
Next!

2951
03:35:46,070 --> 03:35:47,070
Wow!

2952
03:36:00,030 --> 03:36:05,890
I got it!

2953
03:36:06,090 --> 03:36:07,090
Next! Turn left.

2954
03:36:08,130 --> 03:36:09,130
Turn left.

2955
03:36:09,870 --> 03:36:10,230
Turn left.

2956
03:36:10,690 --> 03:36:11,010
Turn right.

2957
03:36:11,490 --> 03:36:12,490


2958
03:36:15,050 --> 03:36:16,370
Who is it? It's me.

2959
03:36:16,530 --> 03:36:17,530
It's amazing.

2960
03:36:19,550 --> 03:36:21,190


2961
03:36:22,750 --> 03:36:23,750
I can't hear you.

2962
03:36:25,110 --> 03:36:26,950
Where are you
looking at? Change.

2963
03:36:30,330 --> 03:36:32,410
OK.

2964
03:36:36,770 --> 03:36:38,460
I said something.

2965
03:36:38,820 --> 03:36:39,860
I said something.

2966
03:36:39,861 --> 03:36:40,861
It's a child.

2967
03:37:09,530 --> 03:37:11,310
No.2 is thick.

2968
03:37:12,670 --> 03:37:14,110
No.2 is thick.

2969
03:37:14,510 --> 03:37:15,510
No.1 is thin.

2970
03:37:20,050 --> 03:37:21,050
No.2 is so floating.

2971
03:37:22,050 --> 03:37:22,370
Change!

2972
03:37:22,670 --> 03:37:23,670
BINBI!

2973
03:37:23,750 --> 03:37:24,750
Change!

2974
03:37:25,150 --> 03:37:26,490
No.1 is...

2975
03:37:26,640 --> 03:37:27,870
No.2 is... Yes, yes, yes.

2976
03:37:27,910 --> 03:37:28,110
It's a bit thin.

2977
03:37:28,450 --> 03:37:30,810
No.2 is... No.2 is...

2978
03:37:31,540 --> 03:37:31,810
What? I don't know.

2979
03:37:32,270 --> 03:37:33,270


2980
03:37:33,960 --> 03:37:34,960
No.3 is bent.

2981
03:37:35,070 --> 03:37:36,850
After No.3, it's bent right and left.

2982
03:37:37,770 --> 03:37:39,790
No.3 and No.4 are similar.

2983
03:37:40,590 --> 03:37:41,030
Yes, they are.

2984
03:37:41,490 --> 03:37:41,950
Maybe they are.

2985
03:37:42,430 --> 03:37:43,510
Are they? I heard that.

2986
03:37:43,511 --> 03:37:49,410
No.4 is thin at the base
and has a lot of air flow.

2987
03:37:53,900 --> 03:37:55,550
They are quite similar.

2988
03:37:56,150 --> 03:37:58,830
They are very similar.

2989
03:37:59,270 --> 03:38:03,430
No.1 is very thin and
has a lot of air flow.

2990
03:38:03,630 --> 03:38:05,030
Yes, yes, yes.

2991
03:38:06,170 --> 03:38:07,170
OK.

2992
03:38:08,130 --> 03:38:09,130
No.4, please.

2993
03:38:14,210 --> 03:38:15,370
Have you gone to bed already?

2994
03:38:16,740 --> 03:38:18,220
Everyone, please take off your masks.

2995
03:38:19,870 --> 03:38:20,870
I don't know.

2996
03:38:21,890 --> 03:38:23,230
Wait, this is difficult.

2997
03:38:23,250 --> 03:38:25,070
I can't see the numbers.

2998
03:38:25,990 --> 03:38:26,990
Who is it?

2999
03:38:27,710 --> 03:38:33,760
I read it three times.

3000
03:38:35,520 --> 03:38:36,520
I don't know.

3001
03:38:40,420 --> 03:38:43,060
I'm going to go with this.

3002
03:38:44,900 --> 03:38:45,900
What did you write?

3003
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:49,160
I already get it.

3004
03:38:52,060 --> 03:38:53,560
One, three, or three times?

3005
03:38:54,060 --> 03:38:55,060
Two.

3006
03:38:55,660 --> 03:38:58,040
What's number 2?

3007
03:38:58,620 --> 03:39:05,820
It's hard to read it.

3008
03:39:05,821 --> 03:39:07,096
It's a little difficult,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

3009
03:39:07,120 --> 03:39:08,220


3010
03:39:09,820 --> 03:39:11,840
How do you feel?

3011
03:39:14,745 --> 03:39:16,665
I think it's better for me
to go around and see.

3012
03:39:17,080 --> 03:39:18,080
It's hot.

3013
03:39:19,300 --> 03:39:20,300
Is it dangerous?

3014
03:39:20,900 --> 03:39:22,760
How do you feel?

3015
03:39:23,980 --> 03:39:25,940
I wonder if everyone's
stimulation is not enough.

3016
03:39:27,080 --> 03:39:28,080
Oh, it's good.

3017
03:39:28,081 --> 03:39:29,081
It's morning.

3018
03:39:35,610 --> 03:39:38,410
What number did you say?

3019
03:39:39,190 --> 03:39:40,190
No.4.

3020
03:39:41,050 --> 03:39:42,050
I think so.

3021
03:39:42,170 --> 03:39:43,170
No.3 and No.3.

3022
03:39:43,400 --> 03:39:45,550
I think it's No.2.

3023
03:39:45,600 --> 03:39:46,680
No one said No.

3024
03:39:48,475 --> 03:39:49,730
2, did they? No.1,
No.2, No.3, No.4.

3025
03:39:50,390 --> 03:39:53,230
No.1 and No.1.

3026
03:39:54,110 --> 03:39:55,290
I don't know.

3027
03:39:57,210 --> 03:39:58,290
I don't know.

3028
03:40:08,740 --> 03:40:09,740
Wait.

3029
03:40:09,800 --> 03:40:10,040
It's OK.

3030
03:40:10,580 --> 03:40:11,120
It's big.

3031
03:40:11,440 --> 03:40:12,440
Wait.

3032
03:40:12,920 --> 03:40:13,220
It's big.

3033
03:40:13,700 --> 03:40:14,700
It's OK.

3034
03:40:14,780 --> 03:40:15,780
It's over.

3035
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:16,520
It's over.

3036
03:40:16,700 --> 03:40:17,700
Please leave the stage.

3037
03:40:18,340 --> 03:40:19,340
Don't show your back.

3038
03:40:19,860 --> 03:40:20,140
Don't show your back.

3039
03:40:20,660 --> 03:40:23,080
Everyone, please turn around.

3040
03:41:05,560 --> 03:41:08,940
It's slippery.

3041
03:41:10,440 --> 03:41:11,440
Really?

3042
03:41:18,940 --> 03:41:19,940
I'll give you a pie.

3043
03:41:21,160 --> 03:41:22,240
Give me your butt.

3044
03:41:31,040 --> 03:41:36,060
It's good, it's good.

3045
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:45,000
OK!

3046
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:48,180
It's regrettable.

3047
03:41:49,100 --> 03:41:49,460
Good luck!

3048
03:41:49,880 --> 03:41:51,260
Good luck! I'm so excited.

3049
03:42:44,805 --> 03:42:46,340
I'm so excited.

3050
03:42:46,540 --> 03:42:47,800
Let's go.

3051
03:42:50,860 --> 03:43:00,410
Let's go.

3052
03:43:09,870 --> 03:43:34,840
I'm going to the concert hall.

3053
03:43:39,460 --> 03:43:44,140
I'm flying very close.

3054
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:46,840
I just got up.

3055
03:43:48,125 --> 03:43:49,800
You got up, didn't you?

3056
03:43:49,900 --> 03:43:50,900
Yes.

3057
03:43:53,460 --> 03:44:12,480
Let's go!

3058
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:47,641
・I'm tired ・I'm tired ・Easy
・The cleaning is over there

3059
03:44:49,000 --> 03:45:49,530
・I'm tired ・I'm tired
・I'm tired ・I'm tired

3060
03:45:57,920 --> 03:45:58,920
Oh, my God! I'll help you.

3061
03:45:59,620 --> 03:46:06,240


3062
03:46:08,160 --> 03:46:17,170
Oh, my God!

3063
03:46:17,490 --> 03:46:18,490
Oh, my God!

3064
03:46:18,650 --> 03:47:01,140
Oh, my God! I feel good.

3065
03:47:02,400 --> 03:47:03,400
Oh, my God!

3066
03:47:05,400 --> 03:47:06,600
Oh, my God!

3067
03:47:09,430 --> 03:47:17,620
8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

3068
03:47:17,621 --> 03:47:18,621
Wow!

3069
03:47:23,300 --> 03:47:24,340
I'm so happy!

3070
03:47:25,240 --> 03:47:26,240
Congratulations!

3071
03:47:40,820 --> 03:47:41,850
Thank you very much.

3072
03:47:42,450 --> 03:47:44,190
Is it over?

3073
03:47:49,600 --> 03:47:50,900
I'll put it in my pocket.

3074
03:47:54,840 --> 03:48:01,330
Is it over?

3075
03:48:01,331 --> 03:48:01,450
What?

3076
03:48:01,510 --> 03:48:04,590
I did it!

3077
03:48:05,370 --> 03:48:05,870
I did it!

3078
03:48:06,050 --> 03:48:41,360
What's wrong?

3079
03:48:41,820 --> 03:48:42,300
You are exhausted.

3080
03:48:42,720 --> 03:48:43,720
I'm exhausted.

3081
03:48:43,760 --> 03:48:44,760
No, you are not.

3082
03:48:46,120 --> 03:48:47,120
I'm tired.

3083
03:48:47,520 --> 03:48:48,840
You are not exhausted.

3084
03:48:50,780 --> 03:48:52,060
You did a good job.

3085
03:48:52,860 --> 03:48:53,860
Thank you.

3086
03:48:54,990 --> 03:48:56,400
You can do it!

3087
03:48:57,840 --> 03:48:59,820
Come on!

3088
03:49:08,910 --> 03:49:09,910
What's going on?

3089
03:49:10,260 --> 03:49:11,610
I've never seen you before.

3090
03:49:12,070 --> 03:49:13,070
How do you feel,
Ichiban? I'm scared.

3091
03:49:13,850 --> 03:49:15,350
Don't do that.

3092
03:49:15,351 --> 03:49:16,351


3093
03:49:18,070 --> 03:49:19,070
What's going on? I'm sorry.

3094
03:49:19,150 --> 03:49:20,150


3095
03:49:22,250 --> 03:49:24,370
I heard that you had an interview.

3096
03:49:24,650 --> 03:49:25,730
Yes, I did.

3097
03:49:26,210 --> 03:49:27,210
These three?

3098
03:49:27,910 --> 03:49:29,470
You said you had nothing to do with me.

3099
03:49:29,850 --> 03:49:30,450
Let's switch.

3100
03:49:30,630 --> 03:49:31,630
Let's switch.

3101
03:49:32,470 --> 03:49:33,470
It's too early.

3102
03:49:34,330 --> 03:49:35,330
No, it's too early.

3103
03:49:35,990 --> 03:49:37,430
What's going on?

3104
03:49:38,840 --> 03:49:40,930
It's the third stage,
so we should hurry up.

3105
03:49:41,610 --> 03:49:43,490
Let's change!

3106
03:49:43,810 --> 03:49:45,550
You're too fast! It's a mansion.

3107
03:49:49,890 --> 03:49:52,750


3108
03:49:55,160 --> 03:49:56,170
Are we already
here? Oh, we're here.

3109
03:49:56,890 --> 03:50:01,030
It's so fast, isn't it?

3110
03:50:04,880 --> 03:50:05,940
Can you see it?

3111
03:50:06,845 --> 03:50:07,920
The tip is smooth.

3112
03:50:09,620 --> 03:50:10,740
The golden ball is small.

3113
03:50:12,220 --> 03:50:12,980
I see.

3114
03:50:13,080 --> 03:50:14,080
I think so.

3115
03:50:14,560 --> 03:50:15,760
This is the parent-child type.

3116
03:50:15,800 --> 03:50:16,460
The parent-child type.

3117
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:17,820
Where is the parent-child
type? Here it is.

3118
03:50:18,380 --> 03:50:20,461
No.2.

3119
03:50:21,480 --> 03:50:21,920
Wait.

3120
03:50:22,060 --> 03:50:23,180
Isn't No.

3121
03:50:24,420 --> 03:50:25,420
2 very long? Yes.

3122
03:50:25,920 --> 03:50:27,440
No.1, No.2, No.3 are the new face.

3123
03:50:29,020 --> 03:50:30,020
Who is No.

3124
03:50:32,880 --> 03:50:32,960
1? I don't know.

3125
03:50:33,660 --> 03:50:34,660
Who is No.

3126
03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:36,440
3? I don't know.

3127
03:50:38,260 --> 03:50:39,260
Change!

3128
03:50:40,780 --> 03:50:41,380
Change! Who is No.

3129
03:50:41,740 --> 03:50:42,740
1? I'm No.

3130
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:45,100
1.

3131
03:50:45,560 --> 03:50:45,860
I'm No.1.

3132
03:50:46,435 --> 03:50:47,780
No.2 is long.

3133
03:50:47,940 --> 03:50:49,480
Please stand by.

3134
03:50:50,760 --> 03:50:56,140
I'm No.8.

3135
03:50:56,141 --> 03:50:56,280
I'm No.8.

3136
03:50:56,281 --> 03:50:57,281
What is my number?

3137
03:50:57,460 --> 03:51:01,140
No.4 is long and straight.

3138
03:51:06,900 --> 03:51:09,660
No.3 is short.

3139
03:51:10,720 --> 03:51:13,480
No.2 is long and straight.

3140
03:51:14,220 --> 03:51:15,540
No.3 is here.

3141
03:51:18,210 --> 03:51:26,080
No.2 and No.4 are similar,
aren't they? It's similar.

3142
03:51:26,330 --> 03:51:33,960
No.2 is long, and
No.4 is thin and long.

3143
03:51:34,460 --> 03:51:35,460
It's straight.

3144
03:51:36,750 --> 03:51:37,750
It's the opposite.

3145
03:51:38,020 --> 03:51:39,900
No.4.

3146
03:51:41,240 --> 03:51:42,360
No.4.

3147
03:51:43,305 --> 03:51:44,800
No.4.

3148
03:51:44,900 --> 03:51:45,760
No.4.

3149
03:51:45,761 --> 03:51:46,761
No.4.

3150
03:51:47,510 --> 03:51:49,000
No.4.

3151
03:51:49,001 --> 03:51:49,680
No.4.

3152
03:51:49,681 --> 03:51:50,580
No.4.

3153
03:51:50,581 --> 03:51:50,780
No.4.

3154
03:51:50,960 --> 03:51:51,960
No.4.

3155
03:51:51,961 --> 03:51:52,000
No.4.

3156
03:51:52,001 --> 03:51:52,020
No.4.

3157
03:51:52,400 --> 03:51:54,360
No.4.

3158
03:51:54,505 --> 03:51:56,060
No.4.

3159
03:51:56,880 --> 03:51:58,480
It's good.

3160
03:51:59,860 --> 03:52:01,300
Not yet.

3161
03:52:01,920 --> 03:52:02,920
OK, shuffle.

3162
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:12,000
Everyone, please sleep.

3163
03:52:16,555 --> 03:52:17,920
Not yet.

3164
03:52:18,360 --> 03:52:19,560
Let's take off the blindfolds.

3165
03:52:20,280 --> 03:52:21,820
Please take off the blindfolds.

3166
03:52:23,300 --> 03:52:24,580
You can take off the blindfolds.

3167
03:52:26,285 --> 03:52:27,285
I got it.

3168
03:52:28,140 --> 03:52:29,140
No way.

3169
03:52:29,300 --> 03:52:30,160
I got it.

3170
03:52:30,161 --> 03:52:32,200
Did you get it? Yes, I did.

3171
03:52:33,720 --> 03:52:34,080
I got it.

3172
03:52:34,081 --> 03:52:35,081
This is No.

3173
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:36,800
3.

3174
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:38,280
Let's exchange No.1 and No.5.

3175
03:52:39,700 --> 03:52:40,700
I haven't decided yet.

3176
03:52:42,920 --> 03:52:44,880
What is No.

3177
03:52:46,700 --> 03:52:47,820
4? This is No.4.

3178
03:52:48,850 --> 03:52:51,440
No.4 is thin, long and straight.

3179
03:52:52,420 --> 03:52:53,480
I got it.

3180
03:52:53,830 --> 03:52:54,830
This is a new mango.

3181
03:52:56,430 --> 03:52:57,100
I got it.

3182
03:52:57,101 --> 03:52:59,040
It's in!

3183
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:08,980
It's in!

3184
03:53:09,340 --> 03:53:10,340
It's in!

3185
03:53:10,640 --> 03:53:11,640
It's in!

3186
03:53:11,960 --> 03:53:12,960
It's in!

3187
03:53:13,800 --> 03:53:14,800
Do you feel good?

3188
03:53:14,860 --> 03:53:16,640
Do you feel good?

3189
03:53:17,505 --> 03:53:20,680
No.1?

3190
03:53:21,440 --> 03:53:22,180
No.1?

3191
03:53:22,380 --> 03:53:23,080
No.1? Oh, she's gone.

3192
03:53:23,081 --> 03:53:24,081


3193
03:53:25,560 --> 03:53:26,560
She's gone?

3194
03:53:26,750 --> 03:53:28,300
She's gone?

3195
03:53:29,620 --> 03:53:30,120
She's gone?

3196
03:53:30,240 --> 03:53:30,780
She's gone?

3197
03:53:31,240 --> 03:53:32,240
She's gone?

3198
03:53:32,620 --> 03:53:33,620
She's gone?

3199
03:53:34,280 --> 03:53:36,380
She's gone!

3200
03:53:38,020 --> 03:53:40,620
She's gone!

3201
03:53:47,260 --> 03:53:48,880
She's gone!

3202
03:53:49,700 --> 03:53:50,700
She's gone!

3203
03:53:52,480 --> 03:53:54,360
She's still so stubborn!

3204
03:53:54,880 --> 03:53:56,680
She's still so
stubborn! I can do it.

3205
03:53:56,681 --> 03:53:58,120


3206
03:53:59,340 --> 03:54:00,680
Why did you fail the interview?

3207
03:54:01,480 --> 03:54:04,100
Why? But I did it.

3208
03:54:04,600 --> 03:54:05,600
You couldn't do it?

3209
03:54:05,640 --> 03:54:06,640
This is definitely 2.

3210
03:54:06,720 --> 03:54:08,420
This is definitely 2.

3211
03:54:08,460 --> 03:54:09,460
It's 2, isn't it?

3212
03:54:09,960 --> 03:54:10,960
It's over there.

3213
03:54:12,860 --> 03:54:14,800
Can I guess the
order? It's over.

3214
03:54:15,320 --> 03:54:17,300
Time's up!

3215
03:54:25,560 --> 03:54:29,640
Please line up No.1, No.2, and No.3.

3216
03:54:33,335 --> 03:54:35,980
Are you ready for the final answer?

3217
03:54:36,260 --> 03:54:37,080
Final answer!

3218
03:54:37,180 --> 03:54:38,600
Please look behind you.

3219
03:54:38,860 --> 03:54:39,860

I got it!

3222
03:54:55,680 --> 03:54:58,680
What should I do?

3223
03:54:59,500 --> 03:55:00,500
I got it!

3224
03:55:04,340 --> 03:55:09,110
I want to do it again.

3225
03:55:09,590 --> 03:55:10,390
You want to do it again, don't you?

3226
03:55:10,490 --> 03:55:11,490
I want to do it again.

3227
03:55:11,650 --> 03:55:13,570
It has a cute voice.

3228
03:55:13,590 --> 03:55:14,590
It's cute.

3229
03:55:15,550 --> 03:55:16,150
It's sleeping.

3230
03:55:16,230 --> 03:55:17,230
The nose is cute.

3231
03:55:24,490 --> 03:55:29,520
We are going to take off the
women's clothes in the service time.

3232
03:55:30,260 --> 03:55:32,260
Excellent chimpanzee.

3233
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:34,120
Do you want to have sex?

3234
03:55:34,940 --> 03:55:37,520
Do you want to have sex?
Do you want to have sex again?

3235
03:55:38,380 --> 03:55:39,800
Do you want to have sex again?

3236
03:55:41,060 --> 03:55:43,720
It is proud to send out like this.

3237
03:55:43,721 --> 03:55:44,760
I'm so proud of you.

3238
03:55:46,660 --> 03:55:48,600
You are going to enter the mark.

3239
03:55:50,080 --> 03:55:51,080
Are you ready?

3240
03:55:51,380 --> 03:55:52,380
Don't be swallowed.

3241
03:55:53,630 --> 03:55:54,640
Let's go.

3242
03:56:01,540 --> 03:56:02,570
I'm here.

3243
03:56:14,420 --> 03:56:16,910
Go, go, go.

3244
03:56:21,145 --> 03:56:23,720
I'm here.

3245
03:56:24,160 --> 03:56:26,100
Can you see me? Don't rush.

3246
03:56:26,800 --> 03:56:27,800
Take your time.

3247

Don't rush.

3248
03:56:29,120 --> 03:56:30,120


3249
03:56:30,540 --> 03:56:31,620
Should I stand up a little?

3250
03:56:32,100 --> 03:56:33,100
Yes.

3251
03:56:33,200 --> 03:56:34,200
I can't.

3252
03:56:34,300 --> 03:56:35,460
Don't rush.

3253
03:56:36,910 --> 03:56:37,910
Can you do it?

3254

Nice to meet you.

Oh, she flew away.

It's very good, isn't
it? Eiko, come on.

3257
03:57:03,635 --> 03:57:05,580
Come on.

Eiko, come on.

3259
03:57:07,200 --> 03:57:08,160
Come on.

3260
03:57:08,180 --> 03:57:08,320
Come here.

3261
03:57:08,620 --> 03:57:08,960
Come on.

3262
03:57:09,560 --> 03:57:10,560

Are you ready? Yes, I am.

3265
03:57:30,160 --> 03:57:31,941
Are you a model?

3266
03:57:32,300 --> 03:57:33,300
Then, you go over there.

3267
03:57:33,660 --> 03:57:34,660
Do you want to calm
down? Calm down once.

3268
03:57:34,700 --> 03:57:36,060
Calm down once.

3269
03:57:36,080 --> 03:57:37,080


3270
03:57:37,260 --> 03:57:38,676
I don't want to go to a place like that.

3271
03:57:38,700 --> 03:57:39,700
I'll do my best.

3272
03:57:40,240 --> 03:57:40,580
Will you go? Yes, I will.

3273
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:41,240
OK, let's go.

3274
03:57:41,241 --> 03:57:42,241
SEX Let's go.

3275
03:57:42,600 --> 03:57:43,600
Let's go.

3276
03:57:43,640 --> 03:57:44,220


3277
03:57:44,320 --> 03:57:45,320


3278
03:57:45,800 --> 03:57:46,800
I'll do my best.

3279
03:57:47,420 --> 03:57:48,420
Put the tension in.

3280

I'll put the tension in.

3281
03:57:49,720 --> 03:57:51,480
Someone's tension will
be in my mango today.

3282
03:57:51,760 --> 03:57:52,180
I'll do my best.

Go, go, go!

3296
03:58:44,330 --> 03:58:44,980
Go! I got a lot.

3297
03:58:45,300 --> 03:59:04,080
You got a lot.

3298
03:59:05,400 --> 03:59:06,400


3299
03:59:10,470 --> 03:59:12,080

Congratulations!

3302
03:59:33,880 --> 03:59:34,490
I have to endure with a cough.

3303
03:59:34,491 --> 03:59:36,450
I have to be patient,
so it may be dangerous.

3304
03:59:45,460 --> 03:59:46,780
I think I can do it.

3305
03:59:47,400 --> 03:59:48,400
Can you do it?

3306

Don't drink it.

3315
04:01:14,350 --> 04:01:20,380
Don't let me breathe.

3316
04:01:21,860 --> 04:01:23,520
I want to drown.

3317
04:01:23,860 --> 04:01:24,860

Everyone, let's go.

04:02:40,110 --> 04:02:41,410
It's a beautiful Chikubi.

3331
04:02:52,150 --> 04:02:54,470
Please wait a moment.

3332

This is the 4th person.

3339
04:03:21,400 --> 04:03:22,530
Please step back.

3340
04:03:27,270 --> 04:03:29,070
You don't have to put
on the rubber band yet.

3341
04:03:29,960 --> 04:03:30,960
Please step back.

3342
04:03:33,270 --> 04:03:35,830
Only the 4th person seems to know.

3343
04:03:39,320 --> 04:03:40,850
No.2 is thin and long.

3344
04:03:44,590 --> 04:03:48,670

04:04:06,951 --> 04:04:09,110
I didn't hit it.

3357
04:04:09,910 --> 04:04:15,130
No.4 is a big ball.

3358
04:04:15,700 --> 04:04:18,090
No.4 is a big ball.

3359
04:04:18,650 --> 04:04:21,210
There are a lot of balls.

3360
04:04:22,740 --> 04:04:24,490
Wait, the ball is big.

3361
04:04:26,670 --> 04:04:27,230
You want to play,
don't you? I want to play.

3362
04:04:27,430 --> 04:04:28,830


3363
04:04:31,150 --> 04:04:32,210
Shuffle?

3364
04:04:32,510 --> 04:04:33,510
Yes, it's shuffle.

3365
04:04:33,890 --> 04:04:34,890
Shuffle again.

Go ahead.

3367
04:04:39,340 --> 04:04:40,610
Is it OK? Please wait a moment.

3368
04:04:41,050 --> 04:04:42,050
Let's go.

3369
04:04:42,795 --> 04:04:44,710
Can I take it off?

3370
04:04:45,125 --> 04:04:46,390
Please take it off.

3371
04:04:47,010 --> 04:04:48,010
OK.

3372
04:04:55,630 --> 04:04:58,130
Oh, it's big.

3373
04:05:08,990 --> 04:05:09,990
Good luck.

3374
04:05:13,710 --> 04:05:15,210
It feels good.

3375
04:05:21,190 --> 04:05:22,610
It's getting bigger.

3376
04:05:23,680 --> 04:05:24,680
It's getting bigger.

3377
04:05:26,270 --> 04:05:27,490
It's not responding at all.

3378
04:05:27,950 --> 04:05:29,470
Let's make it bigger and play with it.

3379
04:05:32,940 --> 04:05:35,510
It's so warm.

3380
04:05:41,610 --> 04:05:42,610
There is!

3381
04:05:43,670 --> 04:05:44,670
Great! It's big!

3382
04:05:45,350 --> 04:05:47,950
It's a jackfruit today, too!

3383
04:05:48,590 --> 04:05:49,310
Oh, it feels good!

3384
04:05:49,490 --> 04:05:50,490
Great!

3385
04:05:53,060 --> 04:05:54,630
Oh, no! It's going to be big!

3386
04:05:55,600 --> 04:06:03,100
Oh, no! It's going to be big!

3387
04:06:03,960 --> 04:06:07,720
Oh, it feels good!

3388
04:06:08,540 --> 04:06:09,540
Oh, it's hot!

3389
04:06:10,520 --> 04:06:12,440
Oh, it feels good!

3390
04:06:12,441 --> 04:06:13,441
It's so cool!

3391
04:06:14,540 --> 04:06:15,540
It's so cool!

3392
04:06:16,530 --> 04:06:18,540
Can I touch it? Yes, you can.

3393
04:06:19,000 --> 04:06:20,380
I'll put it in.

3394
04:06:20,381 --> 04:06:21,381


3395
04:06:22,250 --> 04:06:23,250
Do you like it?

3396
04:06:23,300 --> 04:06:24,140
Do you like to be
patted? Yes, I like it.

3397
04:06:24,300 --> 04:06:25,400
I'll pat you.

3398
04:06:26,130 --> 04:06:27,400


3399
04:06:28,535 --> 04:06:30,500
I'll put it on your face.

3400
04:06:36,065 --> 04:06:38,380
Does it feel good?

3401
04:06:38,381 --> 04:06:41,020
I want to go to the toilet.

3402
04:06:41,460 --> 04:06:42,460
Can you go to the toilet?

3403
04:06:45,430 --> 04:06:48,160
Thanks to Miria, I can go to the toilet.

3404
04:06:48,520 --> 04:06:49,520
You can go to the toilet.

3405
04:06:50,560 --> 04:06:52,200
You like Manko,
don't you? Yes, I do.

3406
04:06:52,900 --> 04:06:59,270


3407
04:07:00,510 --> 04:07:02,610
I want to go to the toilet.

3408
04:07:02,611 --> 04:07:03,611
Mika-san.

3409
04:07:04,210 --> 04:07:05,870
Mika-san.

3410
04:07:06,950 --> 04:07:08,090
It's amazing.

3411
04:07:09,790 --> 04:07:11,010
But this is completely 2.

3412
04:07:13,230 --> 04:07:14,230
I need it.

3413
04:07:18,070 --> 04:07:21,770
I feel 2.

3414
04:07:23,110 --> 04:07:24,310
Here is 2 and 3.

3415
04:07:24,970 --> 04:07:25,970
Which one is 2 and 3? This is 2.

3416
04:07:26,270 --> 04:07:27,270
This is 2.

3417
04:07:27,790 --> 04:07:29,470
This is 2 inside.

3418
04:07:31,050 --> 04:07:32,050
Yes, 3.

3419
04:07:34,810 --> 04:07:35,970
Why do you touch
it? Don't do that.

3420
04:07:35,971 --> 04:07:36,971
Don't do that.

3421
04:07:37,790 --> 04:07:38,790


3422
04:07:41,220 --> 04:07:42,220
Can I take turns? Yes, I know.

3423
04:07:43,270 --> 04:07:44,330


3424
04:07:44,650 --> 04:07:45,270
Are you sure? Yes, I know.

3425
04:07:45,590 --> 04:07:46,190


3426
04:07:46,370 --> 04:07:46,570
Are you sure? Yes, I know.

3427
04:07:47,240 --> 04:07:48,240
Yes, I know.

3428
04:07:49,210 --> 04:07:50,650
This is 2.

3429
04:07:50,810 --> 04:07:52,310


3430
04:07:52,610 --> 04:07:53,610
Don't show your back.

3431
04:07:54,390 --> 04:07:55,750
Don't show your back.

3432
04:07:58,600 --> 04:08:00,080
Please look this way.

3433
04:08:00,840 --> 04:08:01,840
Please line up from 1.

3434
04:08:03,640 --> 04:08:04,640
Who is number 1? Number 1.

3435
04:08:04,700 --> 04:08:05,820
This person is No.1.

3436
04:08:06,040 --> 04:08:07,160
This person is No.4.

3437
04:08:07,600 --> 04:08:08,600
This person is No.

3438
04:08:08,940 --> 04:08:09,120
4? Yes.

3439
04:08:09,440 --> 04:08:10,440
Wait!

3440
04:08:10,960 --> 04:08:11,960
Wait!

3441
04:08:12,420 --> 04:08:13,740
This person is the last one.

3442
04:08:14,160 --> 04:08:15,160
No, everyone knows.

3443
04:08:17,200 --> 04:08:18,200
Then, No.3.

3444
04:08:18,300 --> 04:08:19,040
Yes, No.3.

3445
04:08:19,120 --> 04:08:19,540
No.3 is fine.

3446
04:08:19,920 --> 04:08:20,920
I feel like this.

3447
04:08:21,280 --> 04:08:22,480
I feel like this, too.

3448
04:08:22,500 --> 04:08:22,700
I feel like this.

3449
04:08:23,080 --> 04:08:24,280
That's Kasuke, isn't it?

3450
04:08:24,720 --> 04:08:25,720
Then,

3451
04:08:30,870 --> 04:08:31,870
Please turn around.

3452
04:08:32,290 --> 04:08:34,030
One, two, three.

3453
04:08:34,031 --> 04:09:19,040
It feels good.

3454
04:09:25,000 --> 04:09:26,220
It's hot.

3455
04:09:29,730 --> 04:09:31,420
It's hot.

3456
04:09:31,421 --> 04:09:32,860
I'll put it on you.

3457
04:09:33,560 --> 04:09:34,870
Thank you.

3458
04:09:39,900 --> 04:09:54,230
It's good.

3459
04:09:57,420 --> 04:09:58,740
It's good! It's good!

3460
04:09:59,355 --> 04:10:01,320
Let's make it a little bigger.

3461
04:10:03,390 --> 04:10:04,400
Have a nice trip!

3462
04:10:21,310 --> 04:10:23,750
Have a nice trip!

3463
04:10:39,840 --> 04:10:42,260
The hair smells good.

3464
04:10:52,530 --> 04:10:53,530
One more roll.

3465
04:11:02,210 --> 04:11:03,820
Is it fun?

3466
04:11:05,185 --> 04:11:08,520
Who's your favorite member?

3467
04:11:12,970 --> 04:11:19,980
Is it like this?

3468
04:11:19,981 --> 04:11:28,730
We are going to have a photo session.

3469
04:11:30,450 --> 04:11:31,450
Let's go!

3470
04:11:32,170 --> 04:11:33,170
Let's go!

3471
04:11:35,900 --> 04:11:36,960
Have a good time!

3472
04:11:45,660 --> 04:11:48,640
Aiko, do you want to fall on your mom?

3473
04:11:51,350 --> 04:11:53,670
Hey, you don't have enough manko.

3474
04:11:55,280 --> 04:11:56,490
Look at the second manko.

3475
04:12:30,310 --> 04:12:31,770
Have a good time! Look at me.

3476
04:12:31,771 --> 04:12:33,590
Look at me.

3477
04:12:45,400 --> 04:12:46,400


3478
04:13:52,300 --> 04:14:00,100
Can I touch your boob?

3479
04:14:01,240 --> 04:14:27,300
Does it feel good? Do your best.

3480
04:14:29,690 --> 04:14:40,190


3481
04:14:40,770 --> 04:14:41,570
Are you OK?

3482
04:14:41,571 --> 04:14:44,670
Do you want me to put a lot of it on you?

3483
04:14:46,380 --> 04:14:48,020
Do you want me to put a lot of it on you?

3484
04:14:48,190 --> 04:14:49,190
Are you okay?

3485
04:14:52,470 --> 04:14:53,090
How do you feel?

3486
04:14:53,390 --> 04:14:54,490
It's fun, isn't it?

3487
04:14:55,310 --> 04:14:55,850
It's fun, isn't it?

3488
04:14:55,990 --> 04:14:56,090
It feels so good!

3489
04:14:56,990 --> 04:14:57,990
How do you feel?

3490
04:15:18,110 --> 04:15:19,250
It's amazing, isn't it?

3491
04:15:19,350 --> 04:15:20,350
It's Harlem!

3492
04:15:20,650 --> 04:15:21,650
It's Harlem!

3493
04:15:26,300 --> 04:15:26,600
It's the best!

3494
04:15:27,120 --> 04:15:28,120
It's the best!

3495
04:15:28,260 --> 04:15:29,260
You're so young!

3496
04:15:37,180 --> 04:15:37,500
Wow!

3497
04:15:37,880 --> 04:15:38,880
I finally did it!

3498
04:15:40,240 --> 04:15:44,560
It might be thick.

3499
04:15:44,561 --> 04:15:45,561
It might come out.

3500
04:15:46,620 --> 04:15:47,620
It might come out.

3501
04:15:49,710 --> 04:16:05,820
It came out.

3502
04:16:06,120 --> 04:16:07,620
It came up to my eyes.

3503
04:16:08,760 --> 04:16:09,760
It's amazing.

3504
04:16:11,000 --> 04:16:12,000
It's flying.

3505
04:16:18,860 --> 04:16:22,380
It's not over yet.

3506
04:16:23,020 --> 04:16:24,020
It's not over yet.

3507
04:16:26,020 --> 04:16:28,180
It's amazing. The launch was amazing.

3508
04:16:28,940 --> 04:16:29,940
It's flying.

3509
04:16:30,880 --> 04:16:31,880
It's flying.

3510
04:16:33,850 --> 04:16:37,960
Let's do it again.

3511
04:16:37,961 --> 04:16:39,080
Let's do it one more time.

3512
04:16:39,081 --> 04:16:40,081
Let's do it.

3513
04:16:42,320 --> 04:16:43,660
I was surprised.

3514
04:17:36,330 --> 04:17:37,490
We don't have enough players.

3515
04:17:38,350 --> 04:17:48,190
We don't have enough players.

3516
04:17:49,910 --> 04:17:50,910
Let's play a little more.

3517
04:18:12,130 --> 04:18:13,550
Wow!

3518
04:19:14,610 --> 04:19:16,160
Bakobasu!

3519
04:19:19,060 --> 04:19:20,280
The game is about to start.

3520
04:19:21,100 --> 04:19:22,720
I have an announcement to make.

3521
04:19:23,140 --> 04:19:30,560
Zawa Zawa Zawa Zawa
Zawa Zawa You said earlier.

3522
04:19:31,420 --> 04:19:32,460
Don't eat it.

3523
04:19:37,050 --> 04:19:38,980
Takuro-san

3524
04:19:39,470 --> 04:19:40,470
Takuya-san

3525
04:19:56,660 --> 04:20:00,020
As a result of the competition
between the director and the staff,

3526
04:20:03,320 --> 04:20:05,360
you three will go to the back of the box.

3527
04:20:06,540 --> 04:20:07,540
What?

3528
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:08,600
Back of the box?

3529
04:20:09,200 --> 04:20:09,340
What?

3530
04:20:10,080 --> 04:20:10,640
You have passed.

3531
04:20:10,780 --> 04:20:11,360
What?

3532
04:20:11,780 --> 04:20:12,800
What does that mean? Goodbye.

3533
04:20:12,920 --> 04:20:13,920
It's not good.

3534
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:14,580
It's not good.

3535
04:20:14,800 --> 04:20:15,260
It's not good.

3536
04:20:15,600 --> 04:20:16,760
It's not good.

3537
04:20:16,840 --> 04:20:20,740
Please go to the back
of the box and rehearse.

3538
04:20:20,741 --> 04:20:21,741
I want you to do this.

3539
04:20:22,620 --> 04:20:23,620
Let's go!

3540
04:20:40,850 --> 04:20:42,670
Three people have decided.

3541
04:20:43,630 --> 04:20:45,230
I want to replenish three people.

3542
04:20:45,231 --> 04:20:46,911
I'd like to introduce you to the next one.

3543
04:20:52,790 --> 04:21:04,090
Yes, it's cool.

3544
04:21:10,720 --> 04:21:13,200
This is a gift from the back of the box.

3545
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:26,920
Mr.Tiger and Mr.Tiger will be
replenished from the nurse's office.

3546
04:21:32,900 --> 04:21:35,600
We will do our best with these members.

3547
04:21:36,620 --> 04:21:38,740
Let's go to the game where
the new members have come.

3548
04:21:48,840 --> 04:21:51,160
One, two, three.

3549
04:21:51,161 --> 04:21:56,881
AOA Popular Series
Dice Game Yeah!

3550
04:21:59,740 --> 04:22:00,740

Yeah!

3552
04:22:05,820 --> 04:22:12,500
Now, three actors will roll
dice and go to the first square.

3553
04:22:14,100 --> 04:22:17,580
The name of the game
is written on the square.

3554
04:22:17,581 --> 04:22:20,300
So, please go to another
room and enjoy the game.

3555
04:22:21,780 --> 04:22:25,140
In each room, you can challenge
the popular series of the anime.

3556
04:22:27,600 --> 04:22:31,060
Let's enjoy and do our best
while improving your diving skills.

3557
04:22:31,800 --> 04:22:35,580
Of course, there are rooms that require
acting skills, so please do your best.

3558
04:22:42,420 --> 04:22:45,540
Please come to the first place.

3559
04:22:45,541 --> 04:22:46,781
Please come to the first place.

3560
04:22:48,780 --> 04:22:50,660
Let's roll the dice.

3561
04:23:05,410 --> 04:23:12,150
5, 6, 7, 8.

3562
04:23:12,151 --> 04:23:23,431
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 What is it now?

3563
04:23:23,850 --> 04:23:24,850
What is it now?

3564
04:23:25,130 --> 04:23:25,330
Let's go!

3565
04:23:25,670 --> 04:23:26,670
Ta-dah!

3566
04:23:27,370 --> 04:23:28,370
It's a go-kart!

3567
04:23:28,530 --> 04:23:29,530
Yeah!

3568
04:23:32,600 --> 04:23:33,600
Let's go to go-kart!

3569
04:23:36,280 --> 04:23:37,800
How do you do?

3570
04:23:37,840 --> 04:23:38,600
It's fast, isn't it?

3571
04:23:38,720 --> 04:23:40,300
It's fast, isn't it?

3572
04:23:40,301 --> 04:23:40,880
It's good!

3573
04:23:41,000 --> 04:23:42,000
It's good!

3574
04:23:42,160 --> 04:23:43,160
Awesome!

3575
04:23:43,800 --> 04:23:44,260
Wow! Hi, I'm Nari.

3576
04:23:44,261 --> 04:23:49,300
I'm Kotori.

3577
04:23:51,660 --> 04:23:54,380
I'm Nari.

3578
04:23:56,360 --> 04:24:05,660
We found you!

3579
04:24:05,661 --> 04:24:07,900
Thank you!

3580
04:24:09,180 --> 04:24:12,420
Thank you!

3581
04:24:12,540 --> 04:24:12,780
Thank you!

3582
04:24:12,781 --> 04:24:13,781
Thank you! This is.

3583
04:24:14,120 --> 04:24:15,080
..

3584
04:24:15,081 --> 04:24:18,941
Usami Kirei and... Amedori!

3585
04:25:04,010 --> 04:25:04,710
Yeah!

3586
04:25:04,950 --> 04:25:05,950
Yeah!

3587
04:25:06,530 --> 04:25:07,910
Time is up!

3588
04:25:07,930 --> 04:25:08,990
Time is up! From now on.

3589
04:25:09,870 --> 04:25:10,550
..

3590
04:25:10,551 --> 04:25:12,490
Anyway, do you want to play volleyball?

3591
04:25:13,210 --> 04:25:14,210
Sounds good!

3592
04:25:14,250 --> 04:25:15,450
Let's do it!

3593
04:25:15,451 --> 04:25:18,330
Let's play volleyball!

3594
04:25:18,590 --> 04:25:19,290
Sounds good! That's unfair.

3595
04:25:19,291 --> 04:25:20,291


3596
04:25:23,180 --> 04:25:24,870
That's Uta-chan's part.

3597
04:25:25,070 --> 04:25:26,070
How do you stop it?

3598
04:25:27,890 --> 04:25:28,890
I'll try it once.

3599
04:25:28,950 --> 04:25:29,950
I'll use magic.

3600
04:25:31,290 --> 04:25:32,330
I'll try it once.

3601
04:25:32,610 --> 04:25:33,610
You'll try it once?

3602
04:25:34,050 --> 04:25:35,070
You'll stop it once?

3603
04:25:37,210 --> 04:25:38,270
But it's already stopped.

3604
04:25:39,130 --> 04:25:40,130
But it's already stopped.

3605
04:25:40,310 --> 04:25:42,970
Move, move, move, move.

3606
04:25:47,950 --> 04:25:48,770
It stopped.

3607
04:25:48,771 --> 04:25:49,771
This is the legend.

3608
04:25:51,350 --> 04:25:53,610
This is amazing.

3609
04:25:54,490 --> 04:25:55,490
Let's move it again.

3610
04:26:01,510 --> 04:26:02,710
Let's do volleyball.

3611
04:26:02,711 --> 04:26:03,711
Let's do it.

3612
04:26:03,990 --> 04:26:04,990
Here we go.

3613
04:26:07,545 --> 04:26:08,670
It was good, wasn't it?

3614
04:26:08,950 --> 04:26:09,950
Oh!

3615
04:26:21,680 --> 04:26:22,680
Rinko is surprised.

3616
04:26:23,140 --> 04:26:25,340
If you are surprised, it's a penalty game.

3617
04:26:26,260 --> 04:26:27,260
It's amazing.

3618
04:26:28,240 --> 04:26:29,240
It's amazing.

3619
04:26:29,490 --> 04:26:31,880
It's like an evolved human being.

3620
04:26:32,100 --> 04:26:33,340
It's amazing.

3621
04:26:34,040 --> 04:26:35,400
But the time has stopped.

3622
04:26:35,920 --> 04:26:38,920
Even if you lick your nipples, you don't
get a penalty, do you? You can do it.

3623
04:26:39,160 --> 04:26:41,840
What is this?

3624
04:26:42,020 --> 04:26:43,020
Is this a real
one? That's right.

3625
04:26:44,020 --> 04:26:45,020


3626
04:26:45,420 --> 04:26:46,560
It's Anaru Marumie.

3627
04:26:47,420 --> 04:26:48,760
Anaru Marumie.

3628
04:26:48,800 --> 04:26:49,800
It's embarrassing.

3629
04:26:49,960 --> 04:26:50,960
It's the same.

3630
04:26:52,280 --> 04:26:53,280
Oh, it's a nipple.

3631
04:26:54,120 --> 04:26:55,120
Oh.

3632
04:26:55,820 --> 04:26:57,280
Tamatama Sukko.

3633
04:26:57,300 --> 04:26:59,000
Oh, Tamatama Gyuute.

3634
04:27:00,450 --> 04:27:01,450
Oh, it's true.

3635
04:27:01,710 --> 04:27:02,916
Do you want to tickle your glasses?

3636
04:27:02,940 --> 04:27:02,980
It's a little stiff.

3637
04:27:02,981 --> 04:27:03,981
She is taking a nap.

3638
04:27:16,890 --> 04:27:18,410
She is not moving or pausing the time.

3639
04:27:20,190 --> 04:27:21,420
She is pausing the time.

3640
04:27:21,421 --> 04:27:22,421
I can't do it.

3641
04:27:27,320 --> 04:27:31,580
This is a great acting ability.

3642
04:27:32,100 --> 04:27:33,100
Amazing.

3643
04:27:34,110 --> 04:27:35,340
It's a little wobbly.

3644
04:27:35,760 --> 04:27:35,920
Is it? It's wobbly.

3645
04:27:36,180 --> 04:27:37,180


3646
04:27:37,280 --> 04:27:37,940
Isn't it wobbly? It's vertical.

3647
04:27:38,200 --> 04:27:39,200
It's vertical.

3648
04:27:39,480 --> 04:27:40,480


3649
04:27:40,620 --> 04:27:41,620
Can't it be
connected? It's true.

3650
04:27:41,780 --> 04:27:42,160
It's no good.

3651
04:27:42,700 --> 04:27:43,700
It's standing.

3652
04:27:43,860 --> 04:27:44,860


3653
04:27:45,260 --> 04:27:46,260
Is it out?

3654
04:27:47,700 --> 04:27:48,260
Out?

3655
04:27:48,430 --> 04:27:49,200
What's out?

3656
04:27:49,325 --> 04:27:51,940
If it's out, it's going to be a doggy.

3657
04:27:52,470 --> 04:27:53,780
Our dog is decided.

3658
04:27:54,620 --> 04:27:55,620
You are a dog.

3659
04:27:57,620 --> 04:27:58,620
You are the first dog.

3660
04:27:59,100 --> 04:28:00,100
Let's go next.

3661
04:28:00,260 --> 04:28:02,790
From today, it's a doggy.

3662
04:28:05,110 --> 04:28:06,270
I want to do this.

3663
04:28:08,890 --> 04:28:12,390
Hey, time is stopped.

3664
04:28:13,740 --> 04:28:14,740
Is it correct? I don't know.

3665
04:28:14,790 --> 04:28:15,790


3666
04:28:16,150 --> 04:28:17,710
I don't know if it's correct.

3667
04:28:17,711 --> 04:28:18,970
It's getting harder and harder.

3668
04:28:20,510 --> 04:28:21,510
Really?

3669
04:28:21,580 --> 04:28:22,830
Please touch it.

3670
04:28:26,230 --> 04:28:27,230
Is it a flounder?

3671
04:28:28,055 --> 04:28:29,370
Is it a flounder?

3672
04:28:31,040 --> 04:28:32,670
You haven't eaten it yet, have you?

3673
04:28:32,790 --> 04:28:33,790
Why?

3674
04:28:34,810 --> 04:28:35,830
Chinguri!

3675
04:28:36,230 --> 04:28:37,230
Chinguri! Here we go.

3676
04:28:37,790 --> 04:28:38,790
Here we go.

3677
04:28:43,050 --> 04:28:44,050


3678
04:28:47,520 --> 04:28:48,700
The hole in the butt is big.

3679
04:28:52,400 --> 04:28:53,480
This is not good.

3680
04:28:58,280 --> 04:29:00,660
It's more dangerous than this.

3681
04:29:02,490 --> 04:29:03,960
What about the others?

3682
04:29:06,000 --> 04:29:08,380
This is a person who can stop time.

3683
04:29:10,800 --> 04:29:12,140
Time! Time!

3684
04:29:12,280 --> 04:29:12,600
Time! Time!

3685
04:29:12,960 --> 04:29:13,960
Time!

3686
04:29:22,110 --> 04:29:23,110
Ready, go!

3687
04:29:24,030 --> 04:29:25,400
Ready, go!

3688
04:29:26,840 --> 04:29:27,900
You're sweating!

3689
04:29:31,950 --> 04:29:33,390
You're right! I'm starting to sweat.

3690
04:29:34,480 --> 04:29:35,480
Isn't it too weak?

3691
04:29:36,660 --> 04:29:39,820
Why am I sweating when
I'm not doing anything?

3692
04:29:42,520 --> 04:29:43,520
Does it smell good?

3693
04:29:43,970 --> 04:29:44,970
I didn't do anything.

3694
04:29:46,115 --> 04:29:48,010
Isn't it plump?

3695
04:29:56,290 --> 04:29:58,130
This is the first time
I've seen such a thing.

3696
04:30:04,650 --> 04:30:05,650
It's stopped.

3697
04:30:05,790 --> 04:30:06,790
Great!

3698
04:30:07,650 --> 04:30:08,690
Great!

3699
04:30:10,610 --> 04:30:12,190
Yoisho!

3700
04:30:14,020 --> 04:30:15,170
Yoisho!

3701
04:30:15,510 --> 04:30:16,510
Yoisho!

3702
04:30:17,030 --> 04:30:18,890
Konnichiwa!

3703
04:30:21,370 --> 04:30:23,650
Yoisho! I see, I see.

3704
04:30:23,990 --> 04:30:25,570
It moved.

3705
04:30:26,610 --> 04:30:31,830


3706
04:30:34,390 --> 04:30:36,450
It's not paused.

3707
04:30:37,350 --> 04:30:38,350
It's not paused, is it?

3708
04:30:39,570 --> 04:30:40,570
It's decided!

3709
04:30:41,590 --> 04:30:42,590
It's decided! It's one man.

3710
04:30:44,100 --> 04:30:45,100


3711
04:30:45,590 --> 04:30:46,590
Please release it.

3712
04:30:47,130 --> 04:30:47,470
Can I?

3713
04:30:47,750 --> 04:30:48,750
I'll take it off.

3714
04:30:49,030 --> 04:30:50,030
Yes!

3715
04:30:51,110 --> 04:30:52,110
Great!

3716
04:30:52,730 --> 04:30:52,910
Release!

3717
04:30:53,130 --> 04:30:53,350
Release!

3718
04:30:53,550 --> 04:30:54,550
Release!

3719
04:30:58,350 --> 04:31:01,260
As a penalty game, you'll be our dog.

3720
04:31:03,660 --> 04:31:04,380
I'll take you to various places.

3721
04:31:04,381 --> 04:31:05,381
She is meowing.

3722
04:31:06,140 --> 04:31:07,160
She is a dog, isn't
she? Look at my dog.

3723
04:31:07,980 --> 04:31:37,780
My dog.

3724
04:31:38,760 --> 04:31:39,760
My dog.

3725
04:31:40,680 --> 04:31:41,980
She is happy.

3726
04:32:02,490 --> 04:32:03,490
She is eating.

3727
04:32:05,960 --> 04:32:06,960


3728
04:32:08,140 --> 04:32:09,300
Great!

3729
04:32:10,420 --> 04:32:11,780
She wants to pee.

3730
04:32:14,840 --> 04:32:15,600
Thank you for the meal.

3731
04:32:15,601 --> 04:32:17,880
Thank you for the meal.

3732
04:32:19,000 --> 04:32:20,240
Thank you for the meal.

3733
04:32:21,680 --> 04:32:22,680
Thank you for the meal.

3734
04:32:32,820 --> 04:32:33,820
Thank you for the meal.

3735
04:32:35,140 --> 04:32:36,140
Do I look beautiful?
Yes, you do.

3736
04:32:37,200 --> 04:32:38,200
Thank you.

3737
04:32:38,320 --> 04:32:39,600
You look great.

3738
04:32:39,860 --> 04:32:40,860


3739
04:32:42,120 --> 04:32:43,120
Thank you for the meal.

3740
04:32:43,480 --> 04:32:45,620
This dog is the best dog.

3741
04:32:46,260 --> 04:32:47,260
Chinchin.

3742
04:32:47,880 --> 04:32:48,520
Chinchin.

3743
04:32:48,720 --> 04:32:50,880
Let's go.

3744
04:32:50,881 --> 04:32:51,881
Here we are.

3745
04:32:53,660 --> 04:32:53,820
Let's go.

3746
04:32:54,660 --> 04:32:55,660
It's cute, isn't it?

3747
04:32:56,200 --> 04:32:57,200
I want to ride it.

3748
04:32:57,320 --> 04:32:58,320
Let's ride it.

3749
04:32:58,560 --> 04:32:59,860
It's wet here.

3750
04:33:00,180 --> 04:33:01,180
No, let's go this way.

3751
04:33:01,800 --> 04:33:04,640
I brought my dog, too.

3752
04:33:04,720 --> 04:33:05,720
Let's go.

3753
04:33:05,880 --> 04:33:07,041
We have a dog other than you.

3754
04:33:07,720 --> 04:33:08,720
Yes, we have.

3755
04:33:08,940 --> 04:33:11,060
I want a male dog.

3756
04:33:12,440 --> 04:33:13,920
Let's catch it until its knees break.

3757
04:33:14,820 --> 04:33:16,040
Where else can we catch it?

3758
04:33:17,020 --> 04:33:17,700
Here?

3759
04:33:17,701 --> 04:33:20,320
Oh, I can hear a dog barking.

3760
04:33:21,060 --> 04:33:22,820
What kind of pet
is it? It's a dog.

3761
04:33:23,240 --> 04:33:25,520


3762
04:33:25,640 --> 04:33:26,640
It's a stray dog.

3763
04:33:27,060 --> 04:33:27,960
It looks like a dog.

3764
04:33:27,961 --> 04:33:28,961
It looks like a dog.

3765
04:33:29,940 --> 04:33:31,020
Look at its eyes.

3766
04:33:31,520 --> 04:33:32,600
Say hello to it.

3767
04:33:32,860 --> 04:33:33,960
Look at its eyes.

3768
04:33:34,100 --> 04:33:35,640
Did you learn how to say hello?

3769
04:33:37,610 --> 04:33:38,610
Say hello to it.

3770
04:33:39,240 --> 04:33:40,240
Say, Wan.

3771
04:33:40,700 --> 04:33:41,700
Wan.

3772
04:33:43,280 --> 04:33:45,100
Thank you for coming.

3773
04:33:51,220 --> 04:33:52,220
I'm surprised.

3774
04:33:53,480 --> 04:33:54,640
I'm Tomomi Matsumoto.

3775
04:33:55,620 --> 04:33:55,920
Hello.

3776
04:33:56,260 --> 04:33:57,940
I'm Tomomi Matsumoto.

3777
04:33:59,020 --> 04:33:59,540
Lick it.

3778
04:33:59,541 --> 04:34:01,520
Hurry up! Excuse me.

3779
04:34:05,940 --> 04:34:11,920


3780
04:34:13,100 --> 04:34:15,220
You don't have to eat it.

3781
04:34:16,340 --> 04:34:21,260
Time out!

3782
04:34:23,260 --> 04:34:27,540
Thank you!

3783
04:34:31,100 --> 04:34:32,220
You're watching, aren't you?

3784
04:34:36,080 --> 04:34:38,060
Ready, set, go!

3785
04:34:38,860 --> 04:34:39,860
So cute!

3786
04:34:40,720 --> 04:34:41,720
I'm going to pee.

3787
04:34:42,160 --> 04:34:42,860
Go ahead.

3788
04:34:43,040 --> 04:34:45,200
Oh, there's a nice toilet here.

3789
04:34:49,010 --> 04:34:50,010
I'm going to pee.

3790
04:34:50,760 --> 04:34:53,040
I'm going to bathe your head first.

3791
04:34:53,780 --> 04:34:55,900
You're going to take a shower?
That's great.

3792
04:34:56,900 --> 04:34:59,760
I'll put it on your body.

3793
04:35:02,900 --> 04:35:10,940
I feel refreshed.

3794
04:35:13,120 --> 04:35:14,600
I feel refreshed.

3795
04:35:16,325 --> 04:35:19,240
It would be nice if you could pick it up.

3796
04:35:22,360 --> 04:35:25,360
Thank you.

3797
04:35:30,350 --> 04:35:31,450
How is it?

3798
04:35:32,700 --> 04:35:35,750
Well, this is the only place where
I can have this kind of experience.

3799
04:35:38,010 --> 04:35:39,110
It's the best.

3800
04:35:40,950 --> 04:35:44,410
As you said, please stay
until someone picks you up.

3801
04:35:45,350 --> 04:35:46,510
Thank you for your hard work.

3802
04:35:47,150 --> 04:35:48,150
OK, let's go.

3803
04:35:50,310 --> 04:35:56,290
Boys, close your eyes and
count slowly to 100 and wait.

3804
04:35:57,710 --> 04:35:58,710
Are you ready?

3805
04:35:59,390 --> 04:36:00,390
Yes!

3806
04:36:00,610 --> 04:36:01,690
Good answer!

3807
04:36:02,070 --> 04:36:03,070
Let's go!

3808
04:36:03,890 --> 04:36:04,890
Let's go!

3809
04:36:05,770 --> 04:36:08,570
Hey, find it! Let's count it.

3810
04:36:08,571 --> 04:36:09,571
Four.

3811
04:36:10,850 --> 04:36:11,850
..

3812
04:36:12,630 --> 04:36:13,630
Five...

3813
04:36:17,990 --> 04:36:30,130
Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten...
Eleven... Twelve... Thirteen... Fourteen...

3814
04:36:30,131 --> 04:36:38,550
Fifteen... Sixteen... Seventeen... Eighteen...
Nineteen... Twenty... Twenty-five...

3815
04:36:38,551 --> 04:37:08,530
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,50,51,52,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,85,86,87,89,90,91,92,23,23,24,24,25,26,27,26,27,28,29,31,24,27,28,30,31

3816
04:37:08,531 --> 04:37:10,070
I'm not sure where it is.

3817
04:37:10,750 --> 04:37:11,530
What?

3818
04:37:11,610 --> 04:37:12,830
I can't find it.

3819
04:37:13,070 --> 04:37:27,791
85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94,
95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 Oh, it's in here.

3820
04:37:29,190 --> 04:37:30,350
When does it come out? Ah, 10.

3821
04:37:30,610 --> 04:37:31,610
Let's go.

3822
04:37:32,370 --> 04:37:32,950
Let's go.

3823
04:37:33,330 --> 04:37:35,590
Thank you very much.

3824
04:37:36,370 --> 04:37:37,450
Are you going to run? Yes, I am.

3825
04:37:37,730 --> 04:37:38,730


3826
04:37:40,430 --> 04:37:42,790
I want to go to the second floor.

3827
04:37:43,310 --> 04:37:44,786
Do you want to go to the second floor?

3828
04:37:44,810 --> 04:37:46,131
I want to go to the second floor.

3829
04:37:49,030 --> 04:37:51,210
I want to find Mr.Yayoi.

3830
04:37:52,430 --> 04:37:53,690
Do you want to find Mr.

3831
04:37:54,090 --> 04:37:55,270
Yayoi? Yes, I want
to find Mr.Yayoi.

3832
04:38:31,370 --> 04:38:32,670
Oh, I found him.

3833
04:38:34,270 --> 04:38:35,430
I found him.

3834
04:38:42,210 --> 04:38:42,390
Can I do it?

3835
04:38:43,100 --> 04:38:45,890
You can do it, but are you standing up?

3836
04:38:46,090 --> 04:38:47,090
It's been 3 minutes.

3837
04:38:47,830 --> 04:38:49,350
You can take it off.

3838
04:39:07,060 --> 04:39:08,530
I told you to stand up.

3839
04:39:17,050 --> 04:39:27,210
I can't do it.

3840
04:39:27,211 --> 04:39:28,010
I can't get it in.

3841
04:39:28,011 --> 04:39:29,011
I can't get it in.

3842
04:39:46,440 --> 04:39:49,360
My nipples are made of chocolate.

3843
04:39:50,720 --> 04:39:51,720
Why?

3844
04:39:51,800 --> 04:39:53,040
My nipples are getting smaller.

3845
04:40:03,250 --> 04:40:04,250
You did a good job.

3846
04:40:04,300 --> 04:40:05,300
Thank you very much.

3847
04:40:06,830 --> 04:40:07,860
It was Himesaki Hana.

3848
04:40:07,861 --> 04:40:08,861
This is Rima-chan.

3849
04:40:16,700 --> 04:40:18,660
Can I look this
way? Yes, you can.

3850
04:40:20,140 --> 04:40:21,400


3851
04:40:22,300 --> 04:40:23,300
Oh, you surprised me.

3852
04:40:23,540 --> 04:40:24,640
There she is.

3853
04:40:25,740 --> 04:40:26,740
Hello.

3854
04:40:27,260 --> 04:40:28,780
I'm not ready at all.

3855
04:40:29,280 --> 04:40:31,280
I'm not ready either.

3856
04:40:31,880 --> 04:40:32,880
What should I do?

3857
04:40:33,400 --> 04:40:34,400
Are you kidding me?

3858
04:40:34,780 --> 04:40:35,780
I'll give you the order.

3859
04:40:35,900 --> 04:40:37,340
I'll give you the order.

3860
04:40:38,360 --> 04:40:39,640
Hey, Zan.

3861
04:40:41,780 --> 04:40:44,460
I get wet easily when I see someone's pee.

3862
04:40:45,680 --> 04:40:46,680
Really?

3863
04:40:46,750 --> 04:40:48,380
Yes. So I want you to show me.

3864
04:40:49,540 --> 04:40:50,540
OK.

3865
04:40:56,610 --> 04:40:57,790
It's pee.

3866
04:41:01,670 --> 04:41:02,870
Isn't it squeaky?

3867
04:41:04,840 --> 04:41:08,870
Well, I want you to see if my pee is wet.

3868
04:41:08,871 --> 04:41:10,030
Let's see if I can do it.

3869
04:41:10,570 --> 04:41:11,730
Can you come a little
closer? Can I? Then.

3870
04:41:12,890 --> 04:41:16,730
..

3871
04:41:18,580 --> 04:41:19,580
Can I say the truth?

3872
04:41:21,505 --> 04:41:23,440
What is Hazure?

3873
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:26,200
Hazure?

3874
04:41:29,240 --> 04:41:30,480
What is Hazure?

3875
04:41:33,090 --> 04:41:34,090
You...

3876
04:41:34,450 --> 04:41:35,560
can't rematch and have sex!

3877
04:41:36,920 --> 04:41:37,920
Why?

3878
04:41:38,960 --> 04:41:39,960
Don't mind! I see.

3879
04:41:40,900 --> 04:41:41,900


3880
04:41:42,300 --> 04:41:43,440
Don't mind!

3881
04:41:44,000 --> 04:41:46,240
I was so excited and ready to go.

3882
04:41:46,560 --> 04:41:47,560
But after this.

3883
04:41:47,680 --> 04:41:48,260
After this? After this.

3884
04:41:48,400 --> 04:41:48,600


3885
04:41:48,910 --> 04:41:50,400
Right, there's still more.

3886
04:41:51,840 --> 04:41:53,160
But don't you feel
sorry for her? I do.

3887
04:41:53,990 --> 04:41:55,740
I do feel a little.

3888
04:41:56,810 --> 04:41:57,810
I said, don't mind!

3889
04:42:00,610 --> 04:42:02,720
But I did my best for you.

3890
04:42:03,040 --> 04:42:04,040
Thank you.

3891
04:42:04,165 --> 04:42:04,920
I want to give it to you.

3892
04:42:04,921 --> 04:42:05,220
I'm going to eat it.

3893
04:42:05,640 --> 04:42:07,820
Stand up.

3894
04:42:08,790 --> 04:42:10,100
You were full of food.

3895
04:42:19,860 --> 04:42:21,400
I'll cool it down with my mouth.

3896
04:42:38,090 --> 04:42:39,090
This bread?

3897
04:42:55,800 --> 04:42:56,800
Is this okay?

3898
04:43:00,360 --> 04:43:01,820
Is it a miss? No, it's not.

3899
04:43:02,360 --> 04:43:03,360
It happens.

3900
04:43:04,640 --> 04:43:05,640
It happens.

3901
04:43:05,760 --> 04:43:06,760


3902
04:43:07,680 --> 04:43:10,540
It seems to be over.

3903
04:43:11,220 --> 04:43:13,220
It's a two-shot, so it's over.

3904
04:43:16,960 --> 04:43:17,960
We're done.

3905
04:43:18,380 --> 04:43:18,860
Thank you for your hard work.

3906
04:43:19,160 --> 04:43:20,320
Thank you for your hard work.

3907
04:43:23,420 --> 04:43:26,540
Are you using the secret weapon?

3908
04:43:39,340 --> 04:43:40,140
Hurry up!

3909
04:43:40,141 --> 04:43:41,141
Hurry up!

3910
04:43:42,940 --> 04:43:43,940
Oh, no!

3911
04:43:46,485 --> 04:43:49,800
I can't stand up because
it's combined in 3 seconds.

3912
04:43:57,350 --> 04:43:58,640
You're panting a lot.

3913
04:44:00,260 --> 04:44:01,820
I didn't expect you to find me so soon.

3914
04:44:02,140 --> 04:44:03,140
Me, too.

3915
04:44:03,185 --> 04:44:04,360
You're so fast.

3916
04:44:07,640 --> 04:44:08,960
It's too early to put on condoms.

3917
04:44:10,400 --> 04:44:12,160
It's too early for the
duckling to stand up.

3918
04:44:27,565 --> 04:44:29,100
I want to put it in.

3919
04:44:33,420 --> 04:44:34,640
Put it in! Put it in!

3920
04:44:35,330 --> 04:44:37,290
I put it in because the
duckling didn't stand up.

3921
04:44:38,480 --> 04:44:40,480
It's supposed to be put
together in three seconds.

3922
04:44:41,740 --> 04:44:43,660
I'm sorry to put on condoms.

3923
04:45:02,600 --> 04:45:03,600
Do you like Chinchin?

3924
04:45:06,920 --> 04:45:19,430
I like Chinchin, too.

3925
04:45:31,450 --> 04:45:39,740
Look at this. This is Hicchan's dog.

3926
04:45:54,410 --> 04:45:56,400
There was a dog.

3927
04:46:00,080 --> 04:46:02,380
It's because FIX has the
word HAPPENING on it.

3928
04:46:09,340 --> 04:46:10,580
I'm going to go with Toko-chan.

3929
04:46:54,280 --> 04:46:55,590
This is great.

3930
04:47:15,010 --> 04:47:42,010
Can I take it off once?

3931
04:47:42,410 --> 04:47:42,630
Once?

3932
04:47:43,290 --> 04:47:44,290
No.

3933
04:47:44,390 --> 04:47:45,390
What's wrong? I'm so happy.

3934
04:47:58,100 --> 04:48:41,080
I feel so good.

3935
04:48:47,500 --> 04:48:48,980
I feel so good.

3936
04:48:48,981 --> 04:48:50,140


3937
04:48:54,360 --> 04:48:55,360
Wow.

3938
04:48:57,560 --> 04:49:02,640
There are so many.

3939
04:49:10,230 --> 04:49:11,730
Is this a success?

3940
04:49:11,731 --> 04:49:12,731
Isn't it here?

3941
04:49:13,170 --> 04:49:14,170
Yeah!

3942
04:49:19,060 --> 04:49:20,720
I found a toilet on the second floor.

3943
04:49:20,860 --> 04:49:21,980
I thought it was suspicious.

3944
04:49:50,060 --> 04:49:52,020
Oh, I found it.

3945
04:49:53,520 --> 04:49:54,700
Oh, I found it.

3946
04:49:55,880 --> 04:49:56,240
I found it.

3947
04:49:56,241 --> 04:49:57,340
Oh, wait a minute.

3948
04:49:58,240 --> 04:49:58,960
Oh, wait a minute.

3949
04:49:58,961 --> 04:49:59,961
Oh, wait a minute.

3950
04:50:05,540 --> 04:50:10,560
Oh, wait a minute.

3951
04:50:13,100 --> 04:50:14,100
Oh, wait a minute.

3952
04:50:14,220 --> 04:50:16,660
It's only three seconds.

3953
04:50:16,661 --> 04:50:17,661
I'm sure it's a mistake.

3954
04:50:23,710 --> 04:50:25,010
It's a miss.

3955
04:50:26,290 --> 04:50:26,370
It's a miss.

3956
04:50:26,371 --> 04:50:26,590
Is it a miss? It's a miss.

3957
04:50:27,170 --> 04:50:28,170


3958
04:50:28,630 --> 04:50:29,686
How about the other
person? It's a miss.

3959
04:50:29,710 --> 04:50:30,710
We can't unite.

3960
04:50:31,440 --> 04:50:32,950


3961
04:50:38,990 --> 04:50:40,550
What should I do?

3962
04:50:41,035 --> 04:50:42,035
Sometimes it happens.

3963
04:50:43,580 --> 04:50:46,030
I feel sorry for her.

3964
04:50:51,140 --> 04:50:53,610
Take it out and shuffle it in 3 seconds.

3965
04:50:56,030 --> 04:50:57,030
You are so kind.

3966
04:50:57,630 --> 04:50:58,630
I've never heard of it.

3967
04:51:04,445 --> 04:51:05,445
That's all.

3968
04:51:07,140 --> 04:51:08,300
That's all? What a shame.

3969
04:51:09,060 --> 04:51:13,480
What a shame.

3970
04:51:13,820 --> 04:51:14,820


3971
04:51:15,380 --> 04:51:16,060
You are so kind.

3972
04:51:16,360 --> 04:51:17,440
It's a good idea, isn't it?

3973
04:51:57,130 --> 04:51:58,420
Are you standing up?

3974
04:51:58,620 --> 04:51:59,900
Oh, you're not standing up!

3975
04:52:01,065 --> 04:52:04,120
Why? You have to stand up
in three seconds, don't you?

3976
04:52:04,730 --> 04:52:06,690
You have to stand up in
three seconds, don't you?

3977
04:52:11,500 --> 04:52:13,100
You haven't had sex yet,
have you? No, I haven't.

3978
04:52:13,580 --> 04:52:15,020
No, you haven't.

3979
04:52:15,021 --> 04:52:16,056
You wanted to have
sex, didn't you? Yes, I did.

3980
04:52:16,080 --> 04:52:17,561
I wanted to do it.

3981
04:52:22,640 --> 04:52:23,920
I want to do it.

3982
04:52:35,035 --> 04:52:36,035
It's Piper.

3983
04:52:37,260 --> 04:52:38,580
I'm Piper, too.

3984
04:52:38,760 --> 04:52:39,760
It's the same.

3985
04:52:40,530 --> 04:52:41,720
Come here.

3986
04:52:42,970 --> 04:52:46,360
Let's combine.

3987
04:52:48,240 --> 04:52:49,800
Combine, combine.

3988
04:52:56,470 --> 04:52:57,610
It's scary.

3989
04:52:59,360 --> 04:53:00,090
It's a dark place,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

3990
04:53:00,130 --> 04:53:00,890
I'm excited.

3991
04:53:00,891 --> 04:53:01,891


3992
04:53:02,170 --> 04:53:02,750
Are you excited?

3993
04:53:02,990 --> 04:53:03,130
Yes.

3994
04:53:03,610 --> 04:53:04,610
It's so sexy.

3995
04:53:05,360 --> 04:53:06,550
Combine in 3 seconds.

3996
04:53:12,200 --> 04:53:13,780
Wow, it's amazing.

3997
04:53:21,190 --> 04:53:23,170
Can I get used to it?

3998
04:53:27,075 --> 04:53:28,910
How many people did you have
sex with today? About 4 people.

3999
04:53:29,250 --> 04:53:30,350


4000
04:53:31,010 --> 04:53:38,050
Which of the four of us do you want to
have the most comfortable sex? I want to.

4001
04:53:39,230 --> 04:53:39,730


4002
04:53:39,850 --> 04:53:40,850
You want to, don't you?

4003
04:53:41,650 --> 04:53:42,670
Can I draw it?

4004
04:53:43,730 --> 04:53:46,310
Which one do you like
the most? The white one.

4005
04:53:46,830 --> 04:53:47,650


4006
04:53:47,790 --> 04:53:48,830
Do you like the white one?

4007
04:53:49,050 --> 04:53:49,070
Yes.

4008
04:53:49,860 --> 04:53:52,220
Then, if I draw the white
one, it will come out right away.

4009
04:53:52,250 --> 04:53:53,190
If I draw the white one, it
will come out right away.

4010
04:53:53,270 --> 04:53:55,530
But if I draw the white
one, it will end right away.

4011
04:53:55,790 --> 04:53:56,790
It will end right away.

4012
04:53:57,490 --> 04:53:58,750
Can I go first?

4013
04:53:58,751 --> 04:53:59,751
Can I do it?

4014
04:54:07,190 --> 04:54:09,750
Oh my god!

4015
04:54:10,510 --> 04:54:13,070
Hey, I want to hug you.

4016
04:54:13,430 --> 04:54:14,430
Can I hug you? Yes, you can.

4017
04:54:14,630 --> 04:54:14,930


4018
04:54:15,090 --> 04:54:16,090
Yay!

4019
04:54:17,300 --> 04:54:18,570
I like hugging the most.

4020
04:54:20,580 --> 04:54:22,690
Let's hug! I'm so
happy! I'm so happy.

4021
04:54:22,790 --> 04:54:23,790


4022
04:54:56,860 --> 04:54:59,940
I want to grow up.

4023
04:55:00,260 --> 04:55:00,600
I want to grow up.

4024
04:55:01,060 --> 04:55:02,060
That's good.

4025
04:55:02,720 --> 04:55:03,020
I want to grow up.

4026
04:55:03,480 --> 04:55:04,480
That's good.

4027
04:55:06,380 --> 04:55:07,640
Come here.

4028
04:55:11,380 --> 04:55:19,400
I'm so tired.

4029
04:55:24,520 --> 04:55:24,980
Hello.

4030
04:55:24,981 --> 04:55:25,160
Hello!

4031
04:55:25,620 --> 04:55:28,600
I want you to come to my house.

4032
04:55:28,900 --> 04:55:30,540
Please say hello.

4033
04:55:31,540 --> 04:55:34,440
Did you learn how to say hello?

4034
04:55:35,740 --> 04:55:36,740
Please say hello.

4035
04:55:37,680 --> 04:55:38,680
Please say one.

4036
04:55:39,340 --> 04:55:40,340
One.

4037
04:55:40,940 --> 04:55:41,120
Go home!

4038
04:55:41,400 --> 04:55:42,740
Thank you for your visit.

4039
04:55:43,340 --> 04:55:44,840
Thank you for your visit.

4040
04:55:45,840 --> 04:55:46,680
Thank you for your visit.

4041
04:55:46,700 --> 04:55:48,080
You are wet.

4042
04:55:50,890 --> 04:55:51,920
You have become small.

4043
04:55:51,921 --> 04:55:52,921
I'm going to die.

4044
04:56:15,360 --> 04:56:16,360
I'm going to die.

4045
04:56:20,160 --> 04:56:23,940
I wanted you to take it out.

4046
04:56:23,941 --> 04:56:25,100
You took it out a lot.

4047
04:56:26,290 --> 04:56:27,900
I'm frustrated.

4048
04:56:28,980 --> 04:56:31,040
Empty condom.

4049
04:56:34,140 --> 04:56:37,520
I think it's a word that comes out.

4050
04:56:39,580 --> 04:56:44,080
If you can imagine it, you
should speak in your own words.

4051
04:56:45,790 --> 04:56:49,260
If you think you're a real
couple, you'll be able to speak.

4052
04:56:52,370 --> 04:56:55,200
If you start choosing, don't
think too much about the script.

4053
04:56:58,610 --> 04:56:59,730
Morisa-san, what's
going on? Here we go.

4054
04:57:01,560 --> 04:57:03,820
Ready, start!

4055
04:57:03,821 --> 04:57:04,821
Start!

4056
04:57:21,290 --> 04:57:23,790
I wanted to do it
quickly, so I followed you.

4057
04:57:24,630 --> 04:57:26,230
I love you so much.

4058
04:57:27,970 --> 04:57:28,970
Wait a minute.

4059
04:57:29,570 --> 04:57:30,770
Are you looking
forward to it? It's okay.

4060
04:57:31,590 --> 04:57:31,930
Let's go.

4061
04:57:32,585 --> 04:57:34,170
Ready, go.

4062
04:57:35,110 --> 04:57:36,410
I'm sorry.

4063
04:57:37,330 --> 04:57:39,410
I was found out.

4064
04:57:39,645 --> 04:57:40,645
I was found out.

4065
04:57:41,060 --> 04:57:42,060
Let's go.

4066
04:57:43,530 --> 04:57:44,730
Let's go.

4067
04:57:45,470 --> 04:57:46,610
Ready, go.

4068
04:57:48,150 --> 04:57:49,550
Hey, what's going on with the baby?

4069
04:57:51,620 --> 04:57:52,860
Are you excited?

4070
04:57:53,780 --> 04:57:55,260
Are you looking
forward to it? I'm sorry.

4071
04:57:57,850 --> 04:57:58,850
It's too late.

4072
04:57:59,040 --> 04:58:00,480
Thank you.

4073
04:58:01,460 --> 04:58:02,080


4074
04:58:02,280 --> 04:58:03,360
Thank you very much.

4075
04:58:03,700 --> 04:58:05,180
I think it's a movement of the heart.

4076
04:58:05,760 --> 04:58:09,260
I don't think Mr. Morisawa
will come in right away.

4077
04:58:09,860 --> 04:58:10,860
Like your husband.

4078
04:58:13,300 --> 04:58:14,300
Ready, go! Hurry up.

4079
04:58:14,680 --> 04:58:15,680


4080
04:58:19,110 --> 04:58:20,110
Come on, hurry up!

4081
04:58:21,980 --> 04:58:22,980
Hey!

4082
04:58:34,950 --> 04:58:37,230
Your wife's education is also
included in the assessment.

4083
04:58:39,340 --> 04:58:40,440
Are you okay with that?

4084
04:58:41,060 --> 04:58:41,240
Right?

4085
04:58:41,760 --> 04:58:43,060
Well, that's right.

4086
04:58:44,460 --> 04:58:45,460
Hey!

4087
04:58:59,850 --> 04:59:00,850
Are you okay?

4088
04:59:04,680 --> 04:59:05,980
Thank you very much.

4089
04:59:06,730 --> 04:59:08,570
Mr.
Tachibana, thank you for your last speech.

4090
04:59:09,310 --> 04:59:10,580
Let's sit down like that.

4091
04:59:10,581 --> 04:59:11,581
Let's get started.

4092
04:59:13,750 --> 04:59:14,750
Ready, go!

4093
04:59:19,570 --> 04:59:21,160
Yuya, what's up? Let me come closer.

4094
04:59:22,400 --> 04:59:23,540
It's too far.

4095
04:59:24,380 --> 04:59:26,260
You've decided to do it, haven't you?

4096
04:59:27,540 --> 04:59:28,540
Yes.

4097
04:59:28,680 --> 04:59:29,980
You have to enjoy it now.

4098
04:59:31,200 --> 04:59:32,200
Right?

4099
04:59:43,370 --> 04:59:44,370
Right?

4100
04:59:45,510 --> 04:59:46,510
Let's get started.

4101
04:59:47,150 --> 04:59:48,150
Let's get started.

4102
04:59:48,410 --> 04:59:49,410
OK.

4103
04:59:53,865 --> 04:59:55,105
How long will you make me tape?

4104
05:00:07,990 --> 05:00:11,620
Thank you, sorry. I wanted to see you as it
is, but it's a work, so please cut it out.

4105
05:00:11,880 --> 05:00:13,420
It was rude, very rude in general.

4106
05:00:14,310 --> 05:00:15,760
Keep going, keep going.

4107
05:00:16,360 --> 05:00:17,920
OK, start.

4108
05:00:19,020 --> 05:00:21,100
I'll kiss you, Kamata.

4109
05:00:21,580 --> 05:00:22,580
Give me a kiss.

4110
05:00:23,170 --> 05:00:24,280
Hey, don't be so tough.

4111
05:00:27,000 --> 05:00:28,000
Hey.

4112
05:00:29,880 --> 05:00:31,320
Hana, Hana.

4113
05:00:34,960 --> 05:00:35,960
Let's start.

4114
05:00:39,000 --> 05:00:41,520
Let go of me.

4115
05:00:43,100 --> 05:00:46,260
Are you interested in the camera?

4116
05:00:47,140 --> 05:00:48,140
I'm not interested.

4117
05:00:50,960 --> 05:00:52,100
Hana, Hana.

4118
05:00:53,420 --> 05:00:56,100
Look at me.

4119
05:00:56,101 --> 05:00:57,880
Tomo, look at this.

4120
05:00:58,180 --> 05:01:00,140
Look at this.

4121
05:01:02,540 --> 05:01:03,540
Look at this.

4122
05:01:10,100 --> 05:01:11,680
What are you doing?

4123
05:01:12,960 --> 05:01:14,440
I think you are getting used to it.

4124
05:01:15,850 --> 05:01:16,850
Not yet.

4125
05:01:18,700 --> 05:01:19,180
Hana.

4126
05:01:19,600 --> 05:01:20,600
Hana.

4127
05:01:21,700 --> 05:01:23,880
I'm touched too.

4128
05:01:24,600 --> 05:01:25,600
I'm sorry.

4129
05:01:26,140 --> 05:01:27,140
I'm touched.

4130
05:01:28,600 --> 05:01:29,660
I'm sorry.

4131
05:01:39,300 --> 05:01:43,460
I want you to feel it.

4132
05:01:44,210 --> 05:01:45,210
I want you to feel it.

4133
05:02:02,620 --> 05:02:11,220
I want to be your partner.

4134
05:02:13,700 --> 05:02:29,380
Look at this.

4135
05:02:30,730 --> 05:02:33,100
Kana-san, Kana-san!

4136
05:02:33,400 --> 05:02:34,940
Look at this!

4137
05:02:35,780 --> 05:02:37,180
Look at this!

4138
05:02:37,980 --> 05:02:38,980
Kana-san!

4139
05:02:39,020 --> 05:02:40,800
What happened to you?

4140
05:02:41,530 --> 05:02:47,480
I didn't touch you.

4141
05:02:48,480 --> 05:02:50,000
But you're wet.

4142
05:02:51,585 --> 05:02:53,120
No, I'm not.

4143
05:02:53,920 --> 05:02:55,020
Look at this!

4144
05:02:56,260 --> 05:02:57,260
Wow!

4145
05:02:58,100 --> 05:03:01,340
Kana-san, I'm going to lick your nipples.

4146
05:03:01,341 --> 05:03:02,640
I'm going to lick you.

4147
05:03:03,140 --> 05:03:04,520
Look at me.

4148
05:03:14,150 --> 05:03:15,150
Stop it!

4149
05:03:23,210 --> 05:03:25,760
You are a good boy.

4150
05:03:55,080 --> 05:03:57,270
You are making your
husband to vomit so much.

4151
05:03:58,270 --> 05:04:00,930
Look at him. He is vomiting so much.

4152
05:04:00,931 --> 05:04:02,530
What's going on
with you? Let me see.

4153
05:04:03,450 --> 05:04:05,730
Oh, you are sleeping.

4154
05:04:07,890 --> 05:04:08,930
You are excited.

4155
05:04:11,190 --> 05:04:12,310
Your body is honest.

4156
05:04:41,510 --> 05:04:58,360
I'm going to make a video of my cat, Nana.

4157
05:04:59,900 --> 05:05:02,420
Nana is a kitten who is
very active when he's awake.

4158
05:05:02,640 --> 05:05:04,680
Nana is also a baby cat with a cute voice.

4159
05:05:07,320 --> 05:05:09,040
Nana is a kitten who is
very active when he's asleep.

4160
05:05:09,041 --> 05:05:13,320
Nana is a kitten who is
very active when he's asleep.

4161
05:05:15,240 --> 05:05:16,800
Look, you're drooling.

4162
05:05:22,340 --> 05:05:36,320
I can't hold it anymore.

4163
05:05:37,360 --> 05:05:38,360
Look at this.

4164
05:05:38,600 --> 05:05:40,120
I'm going to put it in.

4165
05:07:29,120 --> 05:07:30,280
I'm going to work hard today.

4166
05:07:33,290 --> 05:07:36,700
There's a lot of water in here.

4167
05:11:11,220 --> 05:11:13,140
But you felt good, didn't you?

4168
05:11:21,740 --> 05:11:22,860
Let's do it again next time.

4169
05:11:26,460 --> 05:11:29,280
OK. Let's do it again with four people.

4170
05:11:29,281 --> 05:11:30,840
Let's do it like this.

4171
05:11:37,290 --> 05:11:39,940
Thank you for your time.

4172
05:11:40,420 --> 05:11:41,840
Thank you very much.

4173
05:11:42,680 --> 05:11:43,720
Please follow her.

4174
05:11:45,120 --> 05:11:46,120
It was very short.

4175
05:11:46,700 --> 05:11:48,180
Thank you very much.

4176
05:11:48,580 --> 05:11:48,820
Did you go? Yes, I did.

4177
05:11:49,560 --> 05:11:50,680
That's good.

4178
05:11:50,681 --> 05:11:50,980


4179
05:11:51,260 --> 05:11:52,260
Thank you very much.

4180
05:11:52,580 --> 05:11:53,100
You did a good job.

4181
05:11:53,101 --> 05:11:54,101
Thank you very much.

4182
05:11:56,590 --> 05:11:58,980
I thought you came here as an amateur.

4183
05:11:59,800 --> 05:12:01,000
But, you played NTR drama.

4184
05:12:01,960 --> 05:12:03,920
You did your best.

4185
05:12:06,820 --> 05:12:07,820
Thank you very much.

4186
05:12:10,020 --> 05:12:12,100
I'll give you something.

4187
05:12:16,440 --> 05:12:19,260
I'll give you this.

4188
05:12:20,280 --> 05:12:20,660
Please open it.

4189
05:12:20,661 --> 05:12:22,000
Yes, honey.

4190
05:12:23,140 --> 05:12:24,180
Yes, honey.

4191
05:12:25,340 --> 05:12:26,340
Where are you going?

4192
05:12:27,340 --> 05:12:28,780
Yachi, you did your best.

4193
05:12:29,625 --> 05:12:30,625
Are you excited?

4194
05:12:32,140 --> 05:12:33,800
I'll open it for you.

4195
05:12:34,400 --> 05:12:35,660
I'm glad you got excited.

4196
05:12:36,900 --> 05:12:38,000
Thank you very much.

4197
05:12:41,480 --> 05:12:45,000
Hello, I'm Jun Suihiro.

4198
05:12:45,001 --> 05:12:46,001
Hi, I'm Jun.

4199
05:12:46,780 --> 05:12:52,420
From now on, we are going
to shoot a video together.

4200
05:12:56,710 --> 05:12:58,040
He is...

4201
05:12:59,640 --> 05:13:00,640
No, he is not.

4202
05:13:00,860 --> 05:13:02,400
He is Keen.

4203
05:13:03,520 --> 05:13:04,520
Nice to meet you.

4204
05:13:05,580 --> 05:13:07,920
Nice to meet you, too.

4205
05:13:08,400 --> 05:13:09,880
How do you feel about shooting alone?

4206
05:13:10,780 --> 05:13:12,000
I'm very nervous.

4207
05:13:12,001 --> 05:13:13,600
Are you nervous?

4208
05:13:13,940 --> 05:13:14,980
Don't you touch your butt?

4209
05:13:16,720 --> 05:13:18,800
I can't stand it, so I'm touching my butt.

4210
05:13:19,300 --> 05:13:20,340
You're touching your butt.

4211
05:13:21,240 --> 05:13:22,240
You're energetic.

4212
05:13:22,380 --> 05:13:24,100
You've had three shots today.

4213
05:13:24,380 --> 05:13:25,380
I've had three shots.

4214
05:13:25,730 --> 05:13:26,740
But I'm still energetic.

4215
05:13:27,040 --> 05:13:28,200
He says he's still energetic.

4216
05:13:31,040 --> 05:13:32,040
Stand up and look.

4217
05:13:49,300 --> 05:13:51,300
You look nervous.

4218
05:13:51,450 --> 05:13:54,060
Because you were
shivering until a while ago.

4219
05:13:55,680 --> 05:13:57,120
You finally became a two-legged cat.

4220
05:13:57,960 --> 05:13:59,276
Did you want to be a
two-legged cat? Yes, I did.

4221
05:13:59,300 --> 05:14:00,060
Good boy.

4222
05:14:00,061 --> 05:14:01,061


4223
05:14:04,620 --> 05:14:05,620
You look nervous.

4224
05:14:06,290 --> 05:14:07,300
Oh, wow!

4225
05:14:09,870 --> 05:14:12,180
Your fur is messed up.

4226
05:14:12,181 --> 05:14:14,180
I'm glad to see you.

4227
05:14:16,530 --> 05:14:17,200
I'm glad to see you.

4228
05:14:17,320 --> 05:14:19,420
I want to see you more.

4229
05:14:22,325 --> 05:14:23,860
You are so cute.

4230
05:14:25,310 --> 05:14:27,620
Am I cute? Yes, you are.

4231
05:14:28,090 --> 05:14:30,540


4232
05:14:35,450 --> 05:14:36,980
Why do you get up so soon?

4233
05:14:37,420 --> 05:14:38,420
You are amazing.

4234
05:14:38,900 --> 05:14:39,820
Show me your belly.

4235
05:14:39,821 --> 05:14:40,100
Let me see.

4236
05:14:40,660 --> 05:14:40,900
Yes.

4237
05:14:41,560 --> 05:14:42,560
Wow.

4238
05:14:44,720 --> 05:14:46,480
You really put it out today.

4239
05:14:47,140 --> 05:14:48,320
Yes, I did.

4240
05:14:51,590 --> 05:14:52,590
Does it smell good?

4241
05:14:53,010 --> 05:14:53,750
Yes, it smells good.

4242
05:14:54,010 --> 05:14:54,430
Really?

4243
05:14:54,470 --> 05:14:55,470
You have a lot of hair.

4244
05:14:55,650 --> 05:14:56,930
I'm sorry. I have a lot of hair.

4245
05:14:57,730 --> 05:14:58,730
I like your hair.

4246
05:14:58,890 --> 05:14:59,890
Really? It smells good.

4247
05:15:01,430 --> 05:15:02,450


4248
05:15:02,870 --> 05:15:03,870
Really?

4249
05:15:05,290 --> 05:15:06,050
Wow.

4250
05:15:06,051 --> 05:15:06,130
Wow.

4251
05:15:06,630 --> 05:15:08,130
It's so messy.

4252
05:15:08,131 --> 05:15:10,270
I'm running out of time.

4253
05:15:11,010 --> 05:15:12,070
Itadakimasu.

4254
05:15:38,850 --> 05:15:39,850
Wow!

4255
05:15:42,810 --> 05:15:54,280
I want to do it, too.

4256
05:15:54,500 --> 05:15:55,500
Why? Let's do it.

4257
05:15:56,240 --> 05:15:57,240


4258
05:16:27,280 --> 05:16:28,280
Can I touch you? It's hot.

4259
05:16:41,940 --> 05:16:45,780
It's OK.

4260
05:16:48,960 --> 05:16:49,960


4261
05:16:51,860 --> 05:16:53,220
It's very painful.

4262
05:16:53,800 --> 05:16:54,640
I see.

4263
05:16:54,641 --> 05:16:57,380
One more time.

4264
05:16:58,480 --> 05:17:00,240
Did you finish? Wait a minute.

4265
05:17:00,610 --> 05:17:03,880
I want to put it in.

4266
05:17:04,020 --> 05:17:05,020
OK?

4267
05:17:07,600 --> 05:17:09,160
You are standing up.

4268
05:17:09,440 --> 05:17:10,440
I can stand up.

4269
05:17:11,320 --> 05:17:11,700
No, you can't.

4270
05:17:11,701 --> 05:17:31,960
I can't stand up.

4271
05:17:31,961 --> 05:17:37,200
It's a little tight, but
it can't be helped.

4272
05:17:39,740 --> 05:17:40,780
I want to move.

4273
05:17:41,400 --> 05:17:42,400
Do you want to
move? I'm so happy.

4274
05:17:44,060 --> 05:17:45,120
I'll put it in.

4275
05:17:45,960 --> 05:17:46,960
It's thick.

4276
05:17:51,210 --> 05:17:52,210


4277
05:17:52,800 --> 05:17:53,800
Really?

4278
05:18:02,820 --> 05:18:05,380
It's the thickest I've put in today.

4279
05:18:05,560 --> 05:18:06,560
Really? I'm so happy.

4280
05:18:07,620 --> 05:18:08,620


4281
05:18:09,880 --> 05:18:10,880
I'm getting sleepy.

4282
05:18:12,480 --> 05:18:15,060
Wait, take your time.

4283
05:18:15,460 --> 05:18:16,460
Don't move yet.

4284
05:18:24,110 --> 05:18:25,470
It's so soft.

4285
05:18:27,010 --> 05:18:30,690
It's just right.

4286
05:18:31,360 --> 05:18:33,010
It feels so good.

4287
05:18:35,350 --> 05:18:37,550
Wait a minute.

4288
05:18:38,720 --> 05:18:41,350
It's very...

4289
05:18:48,020 --> 05:18:53,160
It feels good.

4290
05:18:59,000 --> 05:19:00,290
It's amazing.

4291
05:19:03,365 --> 05:19:04,685
Can I take a picture from behind?

4292
05:19:05,350 --> 05:19:07,230
Like this?

4293
05:19:09,555 --> 05:19:11,155
It's amazing that I can do such a thing.

4294
05:19:14,350 --> 05:19:17,910
As expected, Jun-chan is a professional.

4295
05:19:22,260 --> 05:19:24,630
It feels so good.

4296
05:19:25,330 --> 05:19:26,330
It's amazing.

4297
05:19:27,230 --> 05:19:28,230
It's so good.

4298
05:19:29,090 --> 05:19:30,090
It's so good.

4299
05:19:30,840 --> 05:19:36,150
I'm going to put my
feet firmly on the floor.

4300
05:19:36,190 --> 05:19:37,670
I've been doing it for a long time.

4301
05:19:42,670 --> 05:19:45,170
Oh, it's amazing.

4302
05:19:47,310 --> 05:19:49,150
Stay still.

4303
05:19:50,630 --> 05:19:54,170
Oh, it's amazing.

4304
05:20:05,940 --> 05:20:09,080
Bibi, I like your bag.

4305
05:20:09,880 --> 05:20:10,880
Really?

4306
05:20:12,140 --> 05:20:13,540
I want you to put it in my bag.

4307
05:20:13,580 --> 05:20:14,580
Can I put it in your bag?

4308
05:20:15,880 --> 05:20:16,880
Let's put it in your bag.

4309
05:20:29,740 --> 05:20:30,740
Ouch! Wait, wait.

4310
05:20:34,000 --> 05:20:35,160


4311
05:20:50,270 --> 05:20:51,770
I want to pat you.

4312
05:21:10,010 --> 05:21:11,010
Can I go to the
bathroom? Yes, I want to.

4313
05:21:11,490 --> 05:21:12,490
Oh, my God.

4314
05:21:15,990 --> 05:21:17,770
You're really fat.

4315
05:21:20,360 --> 05:21:21,510
You're a really good guy.

4316
05:21:23,130 --> 05:21:24,130
Really?

4317
05:21:25,450 --> 05:21:27,170
Let's put it on when you're in a bad mood.

4318
05:21:27,530 --> 05:21:28,290
Let's put it on.

4319
05:21:28,430 --> 05:21:29,430
I'll find it.

4320
05:21:31,770 --> 05:21:32,770
I'll put it on.

4321
05:21:33,830 --> 05:21:34,790
I have a lot of bags.

4322
05:21:34,791 --> 05:21:35,831
You have a lot of pimples.

4323
05:21:38,280 --> 05:21:39,930
It feels better than the first time.

4324
05:21:41,630 --> 05:21:42,850
It feels so good.

4325
05:21:43,940 --> 05:21:44,950
It's so hard.

4326
05:21:51,010 --> 05:21:52,010
It's hard.

4327
05:21:53,030 --> 05:21:54,030
Because I'm a beauty.

4328
05:21:58,440 --> 05:21:59,710
It feels so good.

4329
05:22:01,450 --> 05:22:02,450
It feels so good.

4330
05:22:04,440 --> 05:22:06,910
Oh, no.

4331
05:22:11,960 --> 05:22:12,960
Oh, no.

4332
05:22:17,080 --> 05:22:18,540
But, you like a bag,
don't you? Yes, I do.

4333
05:22:18,700 --> 05:22:19,700


4334
05:22:20,605 --> 05:22:21,605
Can I take your bag?

4335
05:22:21,960 --> 05:22:22,960
Yes.

4336
05:22:23,060 --> 05:22:23,680
I'll take it.

4337
05:22:23,780 --> 05:22:24,780
Yes.

4338
05:22:25,100 --> 05:22:26,100
Will you give it to me?

4339
05:22:26,420 --> 05:22:27,420
You are so kind.

4340
05:22:27,620 --> 05:22:28,620
Please.

4341
05:22:43,955 --> 05:22:44,650
We don't have time, so we have to go.

4342
05:22:44,651 --> 05:22:45,811
I have to go to the hospital.

4343
05:22:46,170 --> 05:22:59,310
I can see the hole in the buttocks.

4344
05:23:29,500 --> 05:23:30,500
I'm going to use this.

4345
05:23:31,580 --> 05:23:32,460
Help me.

4346
05:23:32,500 --> 05:23:33,500
Help me, Homa.

4347
05:23:35,620 --> 05:23:36,620
Ouch! It's out.

4348
05:23:38,830 --> 05:24:08,280
It's a great.

4349
05:24:09,380 --> 05:24:10,460


4350
05:24:11,410 --> 05:24:13,400
Wait, it's still thick,
so I can't take it off.

4351
05:24:14,140 --> 05:24:14,560
Can't you take it off?

4352
05:24:14,810 --> 05:24:16,080
I'll hold it, so take it off.

4353
05:24:17,200 --> 05:24:18,340
Well, then.

4354
05:24:20,700 --> 05:24:21,940
Can you take it off?

4355
05:24:22,620 --> 05:24:24,600
I'm afraid of this.

4356
05:24:24,880 --> 05:24:27,640
I'm afraid.

4357
05:24:27,641 --> 05:24:28,641
You are so kind.

4358
05:24:31,350 --> 05:24:32,350
Pass.

4359
05:24:34,820 --> 05:24:39,140
It's amazing.

4360
05:24:41,820 --> 05:24:43,600
I have to put this on.

4361
05:24:43,760 --> 05:24:45,860
This is the fourth one.

4362
05:24:47,030 --> 05:24:48,030
Thanks to you.

4363
05:24:48,340 --> 05:24:49,900
It's amazing.

4364
05:24:50,400 --> 05:24:51,420
Thank you.

4365
05:24:51,630 --> 05:24:53,420
It was fun and you did a good job.

4366
05:24:55,090 --> 05:24:57,300
Thank you for saying that.

4367
05:24:57,301 --> 05:25:00,420
Let's do it again later.

4368
05:25:00,500 --> 05:25:01,500
Promise.

4369
05:25:01,840 --> 05:25:02,840
Promise.

4370
05:25:04,910 --> 05:25:08,340
If you lie, I'll beat you up.

4371
05:25:10,000 --> 05:25:11,300
I'm scared.

4372
05:25:11,860 --> 05:25:12,860
Let's kiss.

4373
05:25:13,620 --> 05:25:15,280
We have to go back to where we were.

4374
05:25:15,281 --> 05:25:16,440
I don't want to go back.

4375
05:25:16,680 --> 05:25:17,680
I'm lonely.

4376
05:25:21,620 --> 05:25:23,940
Let's do it again later.

4377
05:25:29,440 --> 05:25:30,520
We are SUGOTEKU BEYOND!

4378
05:25:35,120 --> 05:25:36,460
What are you going to do?

4379
05:25:37,740 --> 05:25:39,540
We are going to hold it for 10 minutes.

4380
05:25:40,770 --> 05:25:42,900
If we can hold it, we
are going to have sex.

4381
05:25:44,680 --> 05:25:46,860
If we can't hold it, we are going to stop.

4382
05:25:47,720 --> 05:25:50,280
We are going to stop.

4383
05:25:50,281 --> 05:25:52,201
If we want to have sex,
we are going to hold it.

4384
05:25:52,320 --> 05:25:53,320
It's simple.

4385
05:25:53,780 --> 05:25:54,780
But we can't move.

4386
05:25:58,300 --> 05:25:59,940
If we get in the way, we can't eat.

4387
05:25:59,960 --> 05:26:01,696
〔Riku〕 I'm going to
start from the beginning.

4388
05:26:01,720 --> 05:26:02,940
〔Riku〕 I don't want to do it.

4389
05:26:03,430 --> 05:26:04,920
〔Riku〕 Everyone, please get ready.

4390
05:26:05,090 --> 05:26:06,810
〔Riku〕 It may be difficult to take a video.

4391
05:26:07,280 --> 05:26:08,720
〔Riku〕 I can do it.

4392
05:26:09,320 --> 05:26:09,680
〔Riku〕 It's easy to take a video.

4393
05:26:10,020 --> 05:26:11,280
〔Riku〕 Let's start.

4394
05:26:14,680 --> 05:26:15,940
〔Riku〕 Ready.

4395
05:26:18,680 --> 05:26:19,680
〔Riku〕 Start.

4396
05:26:21,300 --> 05:26:22,320
〔Riku〕 Start.

4397
05:26:22,870 --> 05:26:24,100
〔Riku〕 Start.

4398
05:26:24,101 --> 05:26:24,900
〔Riku〕 Start.

4399
05:26:24,901 --> 05:26:28,000
〔Riku〕 Start.

4400
05:26:28,001 --> 05:26:33,720
I like it when you lick my nipples.

4401
05:26:34,500 --> 05:26:35,900
I like it when you lick my nipples.

4402
05:26:43,380 --> 05:26:45,080
It feels good, doesn't it?

4403
05:26:45,081 --> 05:26:46,081
It's my first time.

4404
05:26:47,680 --> 05:26:49,080
Let me put my hand on your nipples.

4405
05:26:49,940 --> 05:26:53,040
It feels good visually, doesn't it?

4406
05:26:56,605 --> 05:27:04,540
Which do you like
better, breast or nipples?

4407
05:27:06,380 --> 05:27:07,620
Which one do you like?

4408
05:27:08,040 --> 05:27:10,200
Manko noodles or boobs noodles?

4409
05:27:11,400 --> 05:27:12,400
Which one do you
like? Manko noodles.

4410
05:27:12,680 --> 05:27:13,440
Manko noodles?

4411
05:27:13,980 --> 05:27:14,980
Yes.

4412
05:27:15,510 --> 05:27:16,590
But boobs noodles are here.

4413
05:27:17,360 --> 05:27:18,360
Look at this.

4414
05:27:21,620 --> 05:27:35,930
Let's turn it off.

4415
05:27:36,890 --> 05:27:37,350
Let's turn it off.

4416
05:27:37,351 --> 05:27:37,510
Turn it off.

4417
05:27:38,210 --> 05:27:39,210
Oh, no.

4418
05:27:40,690 --> 05:27:43,250
You make it better than usual, don't you?

4419
05:27:43,920 --> 05:27:45,186
Yes, I make it better than usual.

4420
05:27:45,210 --> 05:27:46,210
That's right.

4421
05:27:46,510 --> 05:27:47,696
Do you want to lie down and watch?

4422
05:27:47,720 --> 05:27:49,190
This is good, isn't it?

4423
05:27:50,340 --> 05:27:52,270
I was sitting so as not to go.

4424
05:27:54,420 --> 05:27:55,420
Success!

4425
05:27:56,210 --> 05:27:58,030
This is a real success.

4426
05:27:58,950 --> 05:28:01,650
This is a real success.

4427
05:28:03,040 --> 05:28:04,040
Here comes the lotion.

4428
05:28:04,350 --> 05:28:05,350
Are you going to
do it? Let's do it.

4429
05:28:05,710 --> 05:28:06,710


4430
05:28:11,500 --> 05:28:25,010
I'm trying to do it from the front.

4431
05:28:34,890 --> 05:28:35,890
It hurts.

4432
05:28:37,780 --> 05:28:39,150
I think you should sleep more.

4433
05:28:42,740 --> 05:28:45,270
What's wrong? My face.

4434
05:28:45,510 --> 05:28:46,510


4435
05:28:46,950 --> 05:28:47,950
What's wrong with
you? I feel sick.

4436
05:28:49,350 --> 05:28:50,810


4437
05:29:17,250 --> 05:29:18,910
10 seconds left.

4438
05:29:23,400 --> 05:29:24,400
10 seconds left.

4439
05:29:24,930 --> 05:29:28,490
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4440
05:29:29,290 --> 05:29:30,030
Time's up!

4441
05:29:30,031 --> 05:29:32,850
Congratulations! I won.

4442
05:29:35,710 --> 05:29:36,710


4443
05:29:37,290 --> 05:29:38,290
Congratulations!

4444
05:29:45,300 --> 05:29:46,920
You were so kind to me.

4445
05:29:47,320 --> 05:29:48,460
You should be more kind.

4446
05:29:50,480 --> 05:29:51,840
You did it on purpose,
didn't you? Yes, we did.

4447
05:29:52,020 --> 05:29:53,300


4448
05:29:54,890 --> 05:29:55,890
It's just a mini-corner.

4449
05:29:56,360 --> 05:29:57,200
We should do it longer.

4450
05:29:57,201 --> 05:30:05,640
By the way, among these four
people, I'll ask you a question.

4451
05:30:06,835 --> 05:30:07,915
Who was the most reluctant?

4452
05:30:09,430 --> 05:30:11,700
Who was the most reluctant?

4453
05:30:12,760 --> 05:30:14,400
One, two, three.

4454
05:30:17,100 --> 05:30:18,140
Can I open my eyes? I see.

4455
05:30:18,540 --> 05:30:19,540
I see.

4456
05:30:20,120 --> 05:30:21,120


4457
05:30:22,740 --> 05:30:23,740
I'll announce it later.

4458
05:30:24,560 --> 05:30:25,820
Why do you hate it so much?

4459
05:30:25,821 --> 05:30:29,060
The second one is Shin-Uchi.

4460
05:30:31,240 --> 05:30:34,380
Yuto graduated from the
same school as me a while ago.

4461
05:30:35,040 --> 05:30:36,040
Congratulations! I became a man.

4462
05:30:39,820 --> 05:30:40,960


4463
05:30:42,750 --> 05:30:43,750
You have only one chance.

4464
05:30:45,000 --> 05:30:46,320
You should have a lot of chances.

4465
05:30:46,380 --> 05:30:47,880
I have a lot of chances.

4466
05:30:48,720 --> 05:30:49,720
Show me.

4467
05:30:50,985 --> 05:30:52,000
I have a lot of chances.

4468
05:30:52,001 --> 05:30:53,001
Let's take it off.

4469
05:30:55,120 --> 05:30:57,040
It's OK to take it off
because you are handsome.

4470
05:30:58,620 --> 05:30:59,900
It's a handsome frame this time.

4471
05:30:59,960 --> 05:31:00,960
A handsome frame.

4472
05:31:01,180 --> 05:31:02,180
The only one.

4473
05:31:04,800 --> 05:31:05,800
You are so handsome.

4474
05:31:08,100 --> 05:31:09,100
You are the best.

4475
05:31:09,720 --> 05:31:10,720
I'll show you.

4476
05:31:11,400 --> 05:31:12,880
Is it OK to start from this position?

4477
05:31:13,080 --> 05:31:13,680
What are you going to do?

4478
05:31:13,900 --> 05:31:14,520
Doesn't it hurt here?

4479
05:31:14,760 --> 05:31:15,380
Isn't it hard to do?

4480
05:31:15,580 --> 05:31:15,900
Are you OK?

4481
05:31:16,080 --> 05:31:17,080
Are you OK?

4482
05:31:18,290 --> 05:31:20,100
Roger is a little strong,
isn't he? I'm sorry.

4483
05:31:20,101 --> 05:31:21,101
I'm sorry.

4484
05:31:21,700 --> 05:31:21,960


4485
05:31:22,600 --> 05:31:23,660
You like it, don't you?

4486
05:31:24,620 --> 05:31:25,620
Stop it!

4487
05:31:26,160 --> 05:31:26,580
Stop it!

4488
05:31:27,040 --> 05:31:27,520
I like it!

4489
05:31:27,521 --> 05:31:28,521
Don't look this way!

4490
05:31:28,860 --> 05:31:29,860
Look this way!

4491
05:31:31,100 --> 05:31:32,100
Look straight!

4492
05:31:34,000 --> 05:31:35,000
It's shaking!

4493
05:31:35,360 --> 05:31:36,360
It's disgusting!

4494
05:31:36,620 --> 05:31:36,840
It's close!

4495
05:31:37,080 --> 05:31:37,280
It's close!

4496
05:31:37,620 --> 05:31:38,120
It's close!

4497
05:31:38,360 --> 05:31:39,360
It's close! OK, let's go.

4498
05:31:42,770 --> 05:31:44,230
It's cute, but.

4499
05:31:44,550 --> 05:31:46,910
..

4500
05:31:47,110 --> 05:31:48,110
OK, let's go.

4501
05:31:48,520 --> 05:31:50,360
If you can resist it, you
can do Harlem Shake!

4502
05:31:51,130 --> 05:31:52,130
Ready, go!

4503
05:31:55,960 --> 05:31:56,960
What?

4504
05:31:57,000 --> 05:31:59,500
I want to kiss you.

4505
05:32:01,200 --> 05:32:03,140
Say, I love you, Nozomi.

4506
05:32:04,400 --> 05:32:05,400
Say it.

4507
05:32:06,170 --> 05:32:07,170
I love you, Nozomi.

4508
05:32:08,460 --> 05:32:10,300
I love you, Nozomi.

4509
05:32:11,700 --> 05:32:12,700
What?

4510
05:32:12,750 --> 05:32:13,750
I love you, Nozomi.

4511
05:32:16,020 --> 05:32:19,360
I love you, Nozomi.

4512
05:32:19,590 --> 05:32:25,780
I love you, Nozomi.

4513
05:32:30,260 --> 05:32:35,940
We are back to the beginning, aren't we?

4514
05:32:37,500 --> 05:32:41,340
We are back to the beginning, aren't we?

4515
05:32:42,190 --> 05:32:47,560
Say something to your fans.

4516
05:32:48,590 --> 05:32:51,360
Yuto! Love! Love! Love!

4517
05:32:53,420 --> 05:32:56,040
I want you to make me bigger!

4518
05:32:57,020 --> 05:32:58,020
Make me bigger!

4519
05:33:03,825 --> 05:33:05,600
Cooperate with me!

4520
05:33:11,120 --> 05:33:12,920
Yuto, I'm waiting for you over there.

4521
05:33:13,440 --> 05:33:14,520
Who do you want
me to lick? Nozomin.

4522
05:33:14,680 --> 05:33:15,680


4523
05:33:17,560 --> 05:33:18,940
One bite for Asami-chan!

4524
05:33:19,160 --> 05:33:20,300
That's not fair!

4525
05:33:20,480 --> 05:33:21,480
You're so mean! I don't know.

4526
05:33:23,980 --> 05:33:28,060


4527
05:33:30,420 --> 05:33:31,420
Playboy?

4528
05:33:31,780 --> 05:33:33,140
Playboy bomb?

4529
05:33:36,280 --> 05:33:37,960
Who do you like the
most now? Yuzuriha-chan.

4530
05:33:38,220 --> 05:33:39,300


4531
05:33:40,960 --> 05:33:44,920
This is the first time I've ever
seen such a cute baby in my life.

4532
05:33:45,820 --> 05:33:48,220
Who is it now? It's a baby.

4533
05:33:48,660 --> 05:33:49,660
I see.

4534
05:33:51,440 --> 05:33:52,440
I love you.

4535
05:33:52,680 --> 05:33:53,740


4536
05:34:00,010 --> 05:34:01,670
Three minutes left.

4537
05:34:04,590 --> 05:34:07,010
Do you want to lick me?

4538
05:34:08,290 --> 05:34:09,710
Do you?

4539
05:34:09,910 --> 05:34:11,110
Do you want to drink it?

4540
05:34:12,810 --> 05:34:15,030
She became stiff after
drinking the breast milk.

4541
05:34:15,970 --> 05:34:16,990
Do you like breast milk?

4542
05:34:22,010 --> 05:34:23,610
She likes Nozomi-chan.

4543
05:34:26,030 --> 05:34:27,670
Do you like Nozomi-chan?

4544
05:34:30,610 --> 05:34:31,610
She doesn't want to go.

4545
05:34:33,280 --> 05:34:34,330
She doesn't want to go.

4546
05:34:35,380 --> 05:34:36,650
She doesn't want to go.

4547
05:34:37,010 --> 05:34:39,090
She doesn't want to go.

4548
05:34:40,730 --> 05:34:42,110
10 seconds left.

4549
05:34:47,560 --> 05:34:48,810
We have a lot of opportunities.

4550
05:34:52,570 --> 05:34:54,530
If you go now, you will feel good.

4551
05:34:54,630 --> 05:34:55,630
I love you so much.

4552
05:34:55,770 --> 05:34:58,330
Go now. You will feel good.

4553
05:34:58,990 --> 05:35:01,250
I like Nozomi the most now.

4554
05:35:02,150 --> 05:35:03,150
The end.

4555
05:35:04,070 --> 05:35:05,550
That's why you didn't want to go.

4556
05:35:06,790 --> 05:35:09,510
You have to have two mouths to do it.

4557
05:35:10,170 --> 05:35:11,170
It's difficult.

4558
05:35:11,530 --> 05:35:13,370
You have to have two mouths to do it.

4559
05:35:13,410 --> 05:35:13,630
I can't do it.

4560
05:35:14,230 --> 05:35:15,630
Tell me your love.

4561
05:35:15,930 --> 05:35:16,930
Tell me your love.

4562
05:35:17,570 --> 05:35:19,670
We can't do it alone.

4563
05:35:20,110 --> 05:35:21,110
We can't do it alone.

4564
05:35:22,190 --> 05:35:23,790
I want to have sex with you.

4565
05:35:24,215 --> 05:35:25,215
Say it out loud.

4566
05:35:26,300 --> 05:35:27,730
I want to have sex with Nozomi.

4567
05:35:30,970 --> 05:35:32,856
What kind of sex do you want to
have with Nozomi? Love love sex.

4568
05:35:32,880 --> 05:35:36,450
Do you want to have a
love-love affair? Leave it to me.

4569
05:35:39,690 --> 05:35:44,010
So, you want to have a
love affair with Yuzuriha.

4570
05:35:46,020 --> 05:35:47,020
Do you want to
help her? Yes, I do.

4571
05:35:47,090 --> 05:35:48,190


4572
05:35:49,170 --> 05:35:50,850
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

4573
05:35:51,590 --> 05:35:52,710
I can't help you.

4574
05:35:52,970 --> 05:35:53,970
Don't say that.

4575
05:35:55,170 --> 05:35:56,170
I can't help you.

4576
05:35:56,510 --> 05:35:57,510
I can't help you.

4577
05:35:58,130 --> 05:35:59,130
I can't help you.

4578
05:35:59,320 --> 05:36:01,390
Who do you like the
most in this exhibition?

4579
05:36:05,800 --> 05:36:06,950
I'm sure it's me.

4580
05:36:08,090 --> 05:36:09,890
I think you have a funny face.

4581
05:36:28,470 --> 05:36:31,720
Look at this.

4582
05:36:31,721 --> 05:36:33,140
It's a lipstick.

4583
05:36:38,650 --> 05:36:42,190
What do you like?

4584
05:36:42,340 --> 05:36:43,790
It's a normal size.

4585
05:36:43,791 --> 05:36:45,170
Normal size.

4586
05:37:04,040 --> 05:37:05,180
Oh, it's in.

4587
05:37:08,900 --> 05:37:15,340
It's pretty deep.

4588
05:37:18,020 --> 05:37:19,020
Deep.

4589
05:37:20,120 --> 05:37:21,120
Deep.

4590
05:37:22,020 --> 05:37:23,020
It's quite deep.

4591
05:37:24,060 --> 05:37:26,020
I'm going to take off my hat.

4592
05:37:44,085 --> 05:37:45,280
It's a lot, isn't
it? It's a lot.

4593
05:37:46,240 --> 05:37:46,460


4594
05:37:47,020 --> 05:37:48,020
I'm getting angry.

4595
05:37:53,230 --> 05:38:13,130
It might come out.

4596
05:38:14,330 --> 05:38:15,330
It's coming out.

4597
05:38:16,270 --> 05:38:17,270
I'm getting angry.

4598
05:38:18,050 --> 05:38:19,050
It's coming out.

4599
05:38:20,510 --> 05:38:21,510
Oh, no. It's coming out.

4600
05:38:22,290 --> 05:38:23,630
Quickly, squeeze it out.

4601
05:38:24,110 --> 05:38:25,330
I can't.

4602
05:38:36,320 --> 05:38:38,460
I can't.

4603
05:38:41,720 --> 05:38:42,720
Ah!

4604
05:38:44,490 --> 05:38:45,490
It's delicious!

4605
05:38:46,215 --> 05:38:47,300
It's like a delicious ramen.

4606
05:38:47,320 --> 05:38:48,320
Don't you feel
ticklish? It's okay.

4607
05:38:48,460 --> 05:38:50,720
Success!

4608
05:38:53,020 --> 05:38:54,020
Thank you!

4609
05:38:54,460 --> 05:38:55,460
To the camera!

4610
05:38:56,220 --> 05:38:57,220
Wow!

4611
05:38:59,520 --> 05:39:07,420
I'm starting to remember my youth.

4612
05:39:08,020 --> 05:39:09,020
I'm getting dizzy.

4613
05:39:17,930 --> 05:39:19,930
The cat who is in the
hospital has been abandoned.

4614
05:39:32,000 --> 05:39:36,820
The cat is in the hospital, but the vet
said that he was admitted to the hospital.

4615
05:39:46,710 --> 05:39:47,227
Even though the cat
was in the hospital,

4616
05:39:47,239 --> 05:39:47,820
the vet said that he
was in a bad condition.

4617
05:39:47,821 --> 05:39:48,483
The vet had to take the
cat to the vet, and the

4618
05:39:48,495 --> 05:39:49,140
vet said that the cat
was in a bad condition.

4619
05:39:49,141 --> 05:39:51,980
Yuta is kissing while opening his eyes.

4620
05:39:55,040 --> 05:39:56,720
You want to see various things, don't you?

4621
05:39:57,260 --> 05:39:58,600
Don't you want to see Omanko?

4622
05:39:59,800 --> 05:40:01,000
Do you want to see Omanko?

4623
05:40:02,560 --> 05:40:03,680
I don't want to lick Omanko.

4624
05:40:05,680 --> 05:40:07,380
He is a supporter.

4625
05:40:09,680 --> 05:40:11,360
How is Omanko?

4626
05:40:11,840 --> 05:40:13,120
Omanko is beautiful.

4627
05:40:13,121 --> 05:40:13,720
Really?

4628
05:40:14,040 --> 05:40:14,600
What is it? It's pink.

4629
05:40:15,000 --> 05:40:16,000


4630
05:40:16,880 --> 05:40:18,120
I'm going to lick it by myself.

4631
05:40:19,460 --> 05:40:20,460
Can I lick it? Yes, you can.

4632
05:40:21,080 --> 05:40:23,041
Please tell me how it tastes.

4633
05:40:23,220 --> 05:40:24,220
I'll do my best.

4634
05:40:24,600 --> 05:40:25,600
Oh, wow.

4635
05:40:27,640 --> 05:40:28,640
Taste it.

4636
05:40:28,720 --> 05:40:29,960
Taste it, taste it.

4637
05:40:30,120 --> 05:40:31,260
Slowly, slowly.

4638
05:40:31,460 --> 05:40:31,680
It's sticky.

4639
05:40:32,100 --> 05:40:32,500
Really?

4640
05:40:32,740 --> 05:40:33,740
Do you always do that?

4641
05:40:37,650 --> 05:40:38,340
How do you do that?

4642
05:40:38,341 --> 05:40:39,341
What do you want to do?

4643
05:40:39,960 --> 05:40:40,960
What do you want to do?

4644
05:40:43,380 --> 05:40:45,800
I want you to lick me.

4645
05:40:45,900 --> 05:40:46,980
Do you want me to
lick you? Look at me.

4646
05:40:53,000 --> 05:40:54,000


4647
05:41:01,060 --> 05:41:05,540
What do you want to do?

4648
05:41:05,541 --> 05:41:06,380
Do you want to put it in?

4649
05:41:06,381 --> 05:41:08,080
You want to put it in?

4650
05:41:08,220 --> 05:41:09,380
Do you want to
put it in? I'm sorry.

4651
05:41:09,660 --> 05:41:11,660
I'll put it in.

4652
05:41:18,560 --> 05:41:21,680
I'll put it in.

4653
05:41:22,380 --> 05:41:23,380
Look at me.

4654
05:41:30,370 --> 05:41:35,350
Look at me.

4655
05:41:36,310 --> 05:41:39,730
It's okay, it's okay.

4656
05:41:44,710 --> 05:41:48,720
Is this a lip? It's not a lip.

4657
05:41:49,000 --> 05:41:50,000


4658
05:41:50,480 --> 05:41:51,540
It's not shaking yet.

4659
05:41:54,660 --> 05:41:56,020
I'm sorry.

4660
05:41:56,360 --> 05:41:57,360
Yuto!

4661
05:41:57,440 --> 05:41:58,440
Yuto!

4662
05:41:59,800 --> 05:42:01,560
I'm a little nervous, but...

4663
05:42:01,685 --> 05:42:03,980
I'm sorry.

4664
05:42:04,940 --> 05:42:06,280
I'm a little nervous,
but... I'm a little sad.

4665
05:42:06,700 --> 05:42:07,700
I agree.

4666
05:42:07,980 --> 05:42:10,260
I'm a little emotional, too.

4667
05:42:10,560 --> 05:42:11,980
Well, last one.

4668
05:42:12,260 --> 05:42:13,260
Okay, I'll do it.

4669
05:42:18,900 --> 05:42:19,750
Thank you.

4670
05:42:19,751 --> 05:42:20,751
Thank you, thank you.

4671
05:42:21,970 --> 05:42:23,410
That's all for the Sugo Tech corner.

4672
05:42:31,470 --> 05:42:32,470
Ma

4673
05:42:35,070 --> 05:42:36,070
Ko

4674
05:42:38,350 --> 05:42:39,350
Ma

4675
05:42:41,670 --> 05:42:42,670
Su

4676
05:42:44,810 --> 05:42:46,110
Bakobasu

4677
05:43:30,840 --> 05:43:32,350
Ready, set, go!

4678
05:43:32,351 --> 05:43:34,010
Nice chimpo voting!

4679
05:43:34,011 --> 05:43:44,200
We've seen the results, and now we're going
to vote to decide who's the best chimpo.

4680
05:43:46,620 --> 05:43:49,840
The chimpo will come
out of this hole in the wall.

4681
05:43:53,800 --> 05:43:57,620
Everyone, please put a sticker on the wall.

4682
05:43:57,900 --> 05:44:02,120
Okay, everyone, let's get started.

4683
05:44:27,930 --> 05:44:29,230
Oh, it's frozen.

4684
05:44:30,950 --> 05:44:33,030
Oh, it's hard.

4685
05:44:35,700 --> 05:44:36,700
Maybe.

4686
05:44:37,900 --> 05:44:44,590
It's shining. It's a doctor.

4687
05:44:56,070 --> 05:44:59,070
You can put it on when you take it out.

4688
05:45:01,310 --> 05:45:03,830
Have you finished putting
it on? Yes, we have.

4689
05:45:04,800 --> 05:45:08,580
We're going to have a meeting.

4690
05:45:09,500 --> 05:45:11,540
I'd like you to take out
the ones without stickers.

4691
05:45:13,850 --> 05:45:15,530
Please take out the ones without stickers.

4692
05:45:17,500 --> 05:45:19,380
How about one sticker?

4693
05:45:19,381 --> 05:45:25,640
I'm going to show you how
to make a chimpanzee hat.

4694
05:45:26,260 --> 05:45:27,880
I'm going to show you how
to make a chimpanzee hat.

4695
05:45:27,881 --> 05:45:29,921
I'm going to show you how
to make a chimpanzee hat.

4696
05:45:36,840 --> 05:45:41,560
I'm going to show you how
to make a chimpanzee hat.

4697
05:45:42,260 --> 05:45:44,300
I'm going to show you how
to make a chimpanzee hat.

4698
05:45:44,920 --> 05:45:46,760
3, 4, 2, 3.

4699
05:45:47,340 --> 05:45:47,660
3.

4700
05:45:47,880 --> 05:45:48,560
3.

4701
05:45:48,800 --> 05:45:49,800
Wow.

4702
05:45:51,090 --> 05:45:55,620
These 3 chimpos are our Nice Chimpos.

4703
05:45:56,500 --> 05:45:57,500
Congratulations.

4704
05:46:06,910 --> 05:46:07,910
That's all.

4705
05:46:08,170 --> 05:46:09,170
Nice Chimpos.

4706
05:46:16,860 --> 05:46:17,540
Thank you.

4707
05:46:17,840 --> 05:46:28,280
Thank you for coming.

4708
05:47:26,000 --> 05:47:31,280
This is the first time for me to
dance at BAHO Olympics in 2012.

4709
05:47:32,600 --> 05:47:34,400
I started in the same way as you.

4710
05:47:36,220 --> 05:47:39,140
I've been dancing for 11 years.

4711
05:47:40,210 --> 05:47:41,250
My name is TACHI TSUYOSHI.

4712
05:47:43,770 --> 05:47:45,170
You still want to dance, don't you?

4713
05:47:45,700 --> 05:47:46,860
You want to dance, don't you?

4714
05:47:48,140 --> 05:47:50,060
You want to dance with
various girls, don't you?

4715
05:47:50,380 --> 05:47:51,380
Let's do our best!

4716
05:47:53,130 --> 05:47:54,300
Thank you very much.

4717
05:47:54,900 --> 05:47:56,180
By the way, he is from Urabako.

4718
05:47:58,280 --> 05:47:59,700
He is a junior high school student.

4719
05:48:00,820 --> 05:48:04,020
I'm from Urabako.

4720
05:48:05,510 --> 05:48:07,420
I don't know how to appeal.

4721
05:48:10,180 --> 05:48:12,260
I came here because I
didn't have a chance to do so.

4722
05:48:13,200 --> 05:48:13,960
How should I appeal?

4723
05:48:13,961 --> 05:48:18,080
This is a simple and clear answer.

4724
05:48:18,160 --> 05:48:22,460
I'll do my best.

4725
05:48:23,730 --> 05:48:25,860
Is there anything else you
want to ask? Yes, please.

4726
05:48:25,880 --> 05:48:27,600


4727
05:48:28,540 --> 05:48:30,100
I'm surrounded by four beautiful women.

4728
05:48:32,085 --> 05:48:33,920
This is the first experience in my life.

4729
05:48:34,760 --> 05:48:35,880
I can't see where I'm going.

4730
05:48:37,460 --> 05:48:38,920
I can't see where I'm going.

4731
05:48:39,370 --> 05:48:42,220
It is said that if you
concentrate on one place, you

4732
05:48:42,232 --> 05:48:45,260
will be able to concentrate
on all things in the world.

4733
05:48:45,360 --> 05:48:46,656
It's one with the fruit,
isn't it? That's right.

4734
05:48:46,680 --> 05:48:47,680


4735
05:48:47,920 --> 05:48:49,400
Next time, I want to go to YouTube.

4736
05:48:50,040 --> 05:48:52,200
I want to go to YouTube.

4737
05:49:09,060 --> 05:50:30,160
It's written here.

4738
05:51:20,200 --> 05:56:03,120
I wonder if it's okay to
have a chat with the teacher.

4739
05:56:50,080 --> 05:56:51,720
I was very motivated.

4740
05:56:52,520 --> 05:56:54,160
I found out that it was easy to stand up.

4741
05:56:55,060 --> 05:56:56,060
Let's go!

4742
05:56:56,820 --> 05:56:57,400
OK!

4743
05:56:57,640 --> 05:56:59,560
Are you ready?

4744
05:56:59,980 --> 05:57:00,980
Yes!

4745
05:57:10,560 --> 05:57:11,560
Let's go!

4746
05:57:12,040 --> 05:57:12,780
Let's go!

4747
05:57:12,920 --> 05:57:17,660
Let's go!

4748
05:57:17,661 --> 05:57:17,940
Let's go!

4749
05:57:18,340 --> 05:57:18,640
Let's go!

4750
05:57:18,641 --> 05:57:18,780
Let's go!

4751
05:57:19,220 --> 05:57:21,180
Are you ready?

4752
05:57:24,900 --> 05:57:26,180
Let's go!

4753
05:57:26,900 --> 05:57:26,920
Let's go!

4754
05:57:26,940 --> 05:57:28,060
Let's go!

4755
05:57:28,200 --> 05:57:35,140
Let's go!

4756
05:57:35,950 --> 05:57:53,220
Can I have a kiss on the cheek?

4757
05:57:53,860 --> 05:57:54,860
A kiss on the cheek?

4758
05:57:56,420 --> 05:58:38,860
Are you ready? Please be serious.

4759
06:02:33,400 --> 06:05:41,560
It feels good.

4760
06:05:41,561 --> 06:05:42,640
There's a bigger one.

4761
06:11:20,100 --> 06:11:21,100
I got an ice cream.

4762
06:12:13,550 --> 06:12:14,610
Hello.

4763
06:12:14,611 --> 06:13:07,160
I'm done!

4764
06:13:09,980 --> 06:14:18,930
Come on!

4765
06:14:46,920 --> 06:14:48,220
I'm done!

4766
06:15:02,440 --> 06:15:04,090
It's only yellow and pink left!

4767
06:15:04,530 --> 06:15:25,430
I'm done!

4768
06:15:31,210 --> 06:15:32,700
Oh, no!

4769
06:16:49,370 --> 06:16:52,070
How did you come up with that?

4770
06:17:14,400 --> 06:17:15,400
How funny!

4771
06:19:01,550 --> 06:19:05,030
〔The first day of the
school's opening ceremony.

4772
06:19:05,031 --> 06:19:48,980
〕 The end!

4773
06:21:13,210 --> 06:21:16,081
One, two, three, Ba

4774
06:21:18,250 --> 06:21:19,310
Ko

4775
06:21:21,690 --> 06:21:22,750
Ba

4776
06:21:25,550 --> 06:21:26,550
SU

4777
06:21:32,740 --> 06:21:34,720
PAKOBASU

4778
06:21:40,480 --> 06:21:42,670
Everyone, we have
a special guest at the

4779
06:21:42,682 --> 06:21:45,380
supermarket to decorate
the end of the first day.

4780
06:21:46,940 --> 06:21:55,780
Who is it?

4781
06:21:56,410 --> 06:21:57,740
Let's see who is here.

4782
06:21:58,020 --> 06:21:59,120
Come on in!

4783
06:21:59,620 --> 06:22:00,620
What?

4784
06:22:01,780 --> 06:22:03,260
Why are you smiling?
I heard a moan.

4785
06:22:03,640 --> 06:22:04,640


4786
06:22:22,490 --> 06:22:23,890
The players are very excited.

4787
06:23:55,630 --> 06:23:56,950
You guys should not be in my way.

4788
06:24:51,800 --> 06:24:53,200
Let's play with the next player.

4789
06:24:55,680 --> 06:24:57,520
It's coming!

4790
06:25:07,280 --> 06:25:08,480
You wanna drink,
don't you? Yes, I do.

4791
06:25:08,600 --> 06:25:09,160
Let's drink.

4792
06:25:09,200 --> 06:25:10,200


4793
06:25:12,920 --> 06:25:14,580
Oh, it feels good.

4794
06:25:46,550 --> 06:25:54,670
Do you like cow?

4795
06:26:03,090 --> 06:26:17,000
I'm going to put it in a bowl.

4796
06:26:19,560 --> 06:26:20,100
I'm going to put it in a bowl.

4797
06:26:20,360 --> 06:26:22,000
Give me a tip.

4798
06:26:27,480 --> 06:26:28,480
Ouch!

4799
06:26:30,540 --> 06:26:50,830
I'm going to put it in a bowl.

4800
06:26:51,330 --> 06:26:52,450
She is a fan of you.

4801
06:26:59,500 --> 06:27:04,000
I'm going to put it in a bowl.

4802
06:27:04,001 --> 06:27:05,001
I'm going home.

4803
06:27:06,600 --> 06:27:45,500
I stood up.

4804
06:27:45,980 --> 06:27:47,180
I also stood up.

4805
06:28:16,640 --> 06:28:17,640
I was scared.

4806
06:28:27,600 --> 06:28:30,560
I'm going to sleep.

4807
06:28:31,020 --> 06:28:32,020
I'm angry.

4808
06:28:32,940 --> 06:28:33,940
It's hot!

4809
06:28:45,280 --> 06:29:30,280
It's going to be a mess.

4810
06:29:31,520 --> 06:29:33,140
I want to put it in.

4811
06:29:33,160 --> 06:29:34,880
It's going to be all over your ear.

4812
06:29:39,040 --> 06:29:40,040
I'm going to put it in.

4813
06:30:23,510 --> 06:30:24,430
I'm going to put it in.

4814
06:30:24,431 --> 06:30:32,950
I'm going to take a picture.

4815
06:30:35,710 --> 06:31:10,150
It's already Sunday.

4816
06:33:44,740 --> 06:33:47,520
You can put your butt on it.

4817
06:33:48,040 --> 06:33:49,780
Put your legs on it, too.

4818
06:33:49,781 --> 06:33:50,781
Yes, yes, yes.

4819
06:33:50,940 --> 06:33:52,740
I'm so happy.

4820
06:33:54,960 --> 06:34:39,850
I can't speak a word.

4821
06:34:40,710 --> 06:34:42,370
I can't speak a word.

4822
06:36:52,610 --> 06:38:03,310
It's delicious.

4823
06:40:52,280 --> 06:40:53,280
It's great.

4824
06:40:53,920 --> 06:40:55,980
I can't speak a word.

4825
06:41:15,690 --> 06:41:17,370
I'm a squeezing warrior.

4826
06:41:22,900 --> 06:41:24,840
I'm a squeezing warrior.

4827
06:41:26,080 --> 06:41:27,080
Ouch! Almost.

4828
06:43:01,790 --> 06:43:03,070


4829
06:43:04,250 --> 06:43:09,710
Just a little bit.

4830
06:43:10,750 --> 06:43:15,180
Did you come
out? Ok, I love you.

4831
06:43:16,500 --> 06:43:37,191
Bye.

4832
06:43:38,690 --> 06:43:39,810
Yua, you look so good.

4833
06:43:40,350 --> 06:43:41,510
I love you too.

4834
06:43:41,511 --> 06:43:42,511
I like you.

4835
06:43:42,690 --> 06:43:43,690
I like you.

4836
06:43:44,730 --> 06:43:45,130
I like you.

4837
06:43:45,210 --> 06:43:45,770
I like you.

4838
06:43:45,771 --> 06:43:49,310
I like you.

4839
06:43:50,590 --> 06:43:51,590
I like you.

4840
06:43:52,350 --> 06:43:52,410
I like you.

4841
06:43:52,411 --> 06:43:52,870
I like you.

4842
06:43:52,871 --> 06:43:54,550
Wait! Come here!

4843
06:43:55,030 --> 06:43:55,630
I'm sorry!

4844
06:43:56,010 --> 06:43:57,010
It's OK!

4845
06:45:37,060 --> 06:45:38,320
You're not good at it?

4846
06:45:39,880 --> 06:45:40,980
You're not good
at it? I'm sorry.

4847
06:45:59,980 --> 06:46:00,980


4848
06:46:01,660 --> 06:46:02,660
Can I touch you?

4849
06:46:02,920 --> 06:46:03,920
Can I touch you? I'm sorry.

4850
06:46:30,820 --> 06:46:31,820


4851
06:51:37,650 --> 06:51:38,650
Yeah!

4852
06:52:29,640 --> 06:52:31,420
Thank you! Thank you so much!

4853
06:52:47,600 --> 06:52:47,900
It's open!

4854
06:52:48,620 --> 06:53:00,130
Hey, put it in!

4855
06:53:00,410 --> 06:53:01,590
Put it in!

4856
06:53:02,030 --> 06:53:08,820
Don't you want to put it in?

4857
06:53:09,160 --> 06:53:10,300
Don't you want to put it in?

4858
06:53:12,140 --> 06:53:13,140
Hurry up and put it in!

4859
06:53:21,180 --> 06:53:23,040
30 seconds left, everyone!

4860
06:53:31,410 --> 06:53:32,410

5028
07:23:11,500 --> 07:23:12,500
I'll show you.

5029
07:23:27,230 --> 07:23:33,760
I have to do it.

5030
07:24:32,240 --> 07:24:39,290
I'll make you drown.

5031
07:24:43,720 --> 07:24:44,720
I'll do it.

5032
07:25:09,300 --> 07:25:10,680
I'll do it.

5033
07:25:13,060 --> 07:25:14,140
I'm worried.

5034
07:25:34,820 --> 07:25:36,440
You did it.

5035
07:25:38,120 --> 07:25:40,040
You got a white thread.

5036
07:25:42,860 --> 07:25:46,120
Yeah! I got it! Congratulation!

5037
07:25:46,820 --> 07:25:49,720
I'm glad you got it!

5038
07:25:50,710 --> 07:25:51,710
You did your best!

5039
07:25:53,960 --> 07:25:55,080
OK, let's go to the stadium.

5040
07:25:56,640 --> 07:25:59,360
What are you doing?

5041
07:26:01,020 --> 07:26:02,020
I'm taking a picture.

5042
07:26:02,360 --> 07:26:03,360
What are you doing?

5043
07:26:03,615 --> 07:26:06,300
I told him that I came
here first because I like him.

5044
07:26:06,780 --> 07:26:07,900
I told him.

5045
07:26:11,880 --> 07:26:36,710
I'm so nervous.

5046
07:27:04,230 --> 07:27:27,680
Let me go.

5047
07:27:28,520 --> 07:27:29,040
No.

5048
07:27:29,460 --> 07:27:29,920
Don't go.

5049
07:27:29,921 --> 07:27:30,921
Don't go.

5050
07:27:31,980 --> 07:27:32,980
Let me go.

5051
07:27:34,040 --> 07:27:35,040
No.

5052
07:27:35,120 --> 07:27:35,920
Let me go.

5053
07:27:35,921 --> 07:27:36,340
No.

5054
07:27:36,580 --> 07:27:37,580
Let me go.

5055
07:27:37,640 --> 07:27:38,000
She's gone.

5056
07:27:38,420 --> 07:27:39,420
She's gone.

5057
07:27:41,260 --> 07:27:44,060
Let's practice.

5058
07:28:24,840 --> 07:28:25,840
Great.

5059
07:28:43,990 --> 07:28:45,250
Wow, you even clean the floor.

5060
07:28:46,070 --> 07:28:47,090
You even clean the floor.

5061
07:28:53,470 --> 07:28:55,550
It's good.

5062
07:29:00,570 --> 07:29:02,930
No, no, no.

5063
07:29:03,770 --> 07:29:27,390
It feels good.

5064
07:30:42,440 --> 07:30:43,340
How do you feel?

5065
07:30:43,341 --> 07:30:44,341
Pelo Pelo?

5066
07:30:45,500 --> 07:30:49,560
Teacher, how do you feel
when you are being pelted?

5067
07:31:16,800 --> 07:32:29,480
It's a mouthful.

5068
07:32:46,200 --> 07:32:47,200
I'm so sleepy.

5069
07:34:58,590 --> 07:35:00,790
I can't open my mouth.

5070
07:35:38,300 --> 07:35:39,920
Look at my butt.

5071
07:35:52,700 --> 07:36:18,460
My nipples are swollen.

5072
07:36:19,720 --> 07:36:20,720
I'm going to puke.

5073
07:36:23,560 --> 07:36:24,920
Shake your hips.

5074
07:41:04,370 --> 07:41:57,300
They are in the stage.

5075
07:42:24,850 --> 07:43:04,510
Four people are dancing.

5076
07:43:05,330 --> 07:43:21,780
Let's dance in the circle.

5077
07:43:22,980 --> 07:43:29,340
Look all.

5078
07:43:33,060 --> 07:43:36,640
You did it beautifully.

5079
07:43:58,360 --> 07:43:59,500
I've tied it up!

5080
07:44:01,110 --> 07:44:03,240
This is my professionalism!

5081
07:44:04,170 --> 07:44:05,170
Wonderful!

5082
07:44:05,940 --> 07:44:06,940
Thank you!

5083
07:44:07,500 --> 07:44:07,900
Here we go!

5084
07:44:07,980 --> 07:44:08,980
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5085
07:44:09,120 --> 07:44:09,900
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5086
07:44:10,000 --> 07:44:11,000
Something's coming out!

5087
07:44:11,140 --> 07:44:12,540
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5088
07:44:12,840 --> 07:44:13,840
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5089
07:44:14,000 --> 07:44:15,700
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5090
07:44:16,540 --> 07:44:17,540
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5091
07:44:17,820 --> 07:44:18,400
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5092
07:44:18,401 --> 07:44:30,960
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5093
07:44:30,961 --> 07:44:31,340
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5094
07:44:31,341 --> 07:44:31,400
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5095
07:44:31,401 --> 07:44:32,700
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5096
07:44:33,050 --> 07:44:54,280
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5097
07:44:54,281 --> 07:45:08,140
Oh! Oh!

5098
07:45:08,141 --> 07:45:09,440
The bus ride was fun.

5099
07:45:10,240 --> 07:45:11,240
It was fun.

5100
07:45:11,480 --> 07:45:13,420
I was an amateur for the first time,

5101
07:45:14,240 --> 07:45:16,440
but I was able to see Uyuichi.

5102
07:45:17,640 --> 07:45:19,120
I felt a little embarrassed.

5103
07:45:20,560 --> 07:45:22,820
It was amazing that all the
boys came out unexpectedly.

5104
07:45:23,500 --> 07:45:24,500
That's right.

5105
07:45:24,540 --> 07:45:26,700
I think it's amazing to be able to reflect.

5106
07:45:26,920 --> 07:45:30,000
I think I can't do it because I've
squeezed out half of my energy.

5107
07:45:33,200 --> 07:45:35,540
It was really fun.

5108
07:45:35,541 --> 07:45:36,541
It was really fun.

5109
07:45:37,520 --> 07:45:40,100
I had a lot of fun with everyone.

5110
07:45:41,380 --> 07:45:44,700
It's a bit regretful,
but I had a lot of fun.

5111
07:45:45,780 --> 07:45:46,780
Thank you very much.

5112
07:45:49,350 --> 07:45:50,880
Wakabosu is the best!

5113
07:45:52,360 --> 07:45:53,640
Six is the best.

5114
07:45:59,230 --> 07:46:00,280
Thank you.

5115
07:46:00,281 --> 07:46:13,330
Thank you very much.

5116
07:46:17,510 --> 07:46:18,910
It was a lot of fun.

5117
07:46:19,270 --> 07:46:20,270
It was a lot of fun.

5118
07:46:21,030 --> 07:46:22,890
Next, we are going to Katsudou, Hikata.

5119
07:46:23,730 --> 07:46:25,490
Thank you very much.

5120
07:46:26,110 --> 07:46:27,510
I want to go on a rampage again.

5121
07:46:27,910 --> 07:46:28,950
Bakobasu is the best.

5122
07:46:29,630 --> 07:46:30,630
The best.

5123
07:46:50,170 --> 07:46:53,730
Before we go home, we
have something for you.

5124
07:46:53,731 --> 07:46:57,579
It's nothing special, but
I think everyone is a little

5125
07:46:57,591 --> 07:47:01,450
concerned about the number
of shots fired in two days.

5126
07:47:03,770 --> 07:47:05,530
Can I announce it?

5127
07:47:06,270 --> 07:47:09,550
There are two representatives.

5128
07:47:10,470 --> 07:47:13,030
Should I announce it from the 1st place?

5129
07:47:13,490 --> 07:47:15,350
Let's hear from the 2nd place.

5130
07:47:16,255 --> 07:47:18,690
Please come forward.

5131
07:47:18,691 --> 07:47:19,710
Are you ready?

5132
07:47:20,450 --> 07:47:21,870
In the second place, Match.

5133
07:47:22,810 --> 07:47:23,810


5134
07:47:24,830 --> 07:47:25,850
Match-san?

5135
07:47:26,250 --> 07:47:27,250
Match?

5136
07:47:28,110 --> 07:47:29,110
Match?

5137
07:47:29,410 --> 07:47:30,410
Yes, this person.

5138
07:47:30,570 --> 07:47:31,570
9 votes.

5139
07:47:31,930 --> 07:47:32,930
Wow! Amazing.

5140
07:47:33,390 --> 07:47:34,110


5141
07:47:34,290 --> 07:47:35,850
I'm not sure if it's amazing or not.

5142
07:47:36,410 --> 07:47:37,410
It's amazing.

5143
07:47:37,790 --> 07:47:39,150
In the second place, King Kaz.

5144
07:47:40,510 --> 07:47:41,130


5145
07:47:41,490 --> 07:47:42,490
King Kaz? Kaz-san.

5146
07:47:42,730 --> 07:47:43,730
King Kaz.

5147
07:47:44,350 --> 07:47:44,730


5148
07:47:44,990 --> 07:47:45,990
Wow!

5149
07:47:46,150 --> 07:47:47,150
King Kaz!

5150
07:47:47,270 --> 07:47:47,930
King Kaz!

5151
07:47:47,931 --> 07:47:50,250
I want to take a Guts pose, too.

5152
07:47:51,270 --> 07:47:52,270
But I'm in second place.

5153
07:47:52,510 --> 07:47:53,030
I'm taking a Guts pose.

5154
07:47:53,390 --> 07:47:54,390
I'm in second place.

5155
07:47:54,530 --> 07:47:55,750
I'll announce the first place.

5156
07:47:56,930 --> 07:47:58,010
What's next?

5157
07:47:58,250 --> 07:47:58,650
Do you want to go to the 6th place?

5158
07:47:58,890 --> 07:47:59,050
I want to go to the 6th place.

5159
07:47:59,510 --> 07:48:00,510
Let's go.

5160
07:48:06,630 --> 07:48:07,630
Taku-san!

5161
07:48:09,570 --> 07:48:10,570
I'm in first place!
That's amazing.

5162
07:48:12,470 --> 07:48:13,470


5163
07:48:17,930 --> 07:48:19,470
It's like an invader!

5164
07:48:20,470 --> 07:48:21,470
Wow!

5165
07:48:23,760 --> 07:48:24,190
Wow!

5166
07:48:24,510 --> 07:48:25,510
11 shots!

5167
07:48:25,750 --> 07:48:27,010
11 shots!

5168
07:48:27,410 --> 07:48:28,410
Wow!

5169
07:48:28,870 --> 07:48:30,050
Here it is!

5170
07:48:30,490 --> 07:48:31,010
Wow!

5171
07:48:31,390 --> 07:48:32,390
Look at this!

5172
07:48:35,620 --> 07:48:36,620
Wow!

5173
07:48:37,950 --> 07:48:38,950

07:48:57,750 --> 07:48:59,106
I will give it back in a good way.

5179
07:48:59,130 --> 07:49:01,770
BAKO PASS tour,
the best, the winner.

5180
07:49:02,310 --> 07:49:03,310
Congratulations.

5181
07:49:05,770 --> 07:49:06,770
Congratulations.

5182
07:49:07,410 --> 07:49:08,410
Congrats.

5183
07:49:09,030 --> 07:49:09,590
Thank you.

5184
07:49:09,650 --> 07:49:11,510
Now you must be tired,

5185
07:49:11,910 --> 07:49:13,750
and we are going home.

5186
07:49:14,630 --> 07:49:15,750
Let's go.

5187
07:49:16,070 --> 07:49:17,310
We are leaving.

5188
07:49:17,311 --> 07:49:18,311
Thank you for two days.

5189
07:49:18,630 --> 07:49:20,510
Thank you very much.

5190

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

5192
07:49:23,790 --> 07:49:24,790
Let's go home.

5193
07:49:26,150 --> 07:49:28,030
I'm tired.

5194
07:49:28,650 --> 07:49:29,650
Thank you very much.

5195
07:49:30,570 --> 07:49:31,570
I'm Yu.

5196
07:49:31,650 --> 07:49:32,730
