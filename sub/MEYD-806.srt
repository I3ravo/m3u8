1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,221
It's been two years since I got married.

2
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:24,040
My husband, Yosuke, had
left the company a year ago.

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,761
Then he started an investment
business in oil and gas development.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,560
He kept trying to get close to the company.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
However, he found out that the
investment company was working on fraud.

6
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,620
The company disappeared before he knew it.

7
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,640
The manager also disappeared.

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,740
Yosuke, who had been pulling
investment funds from many customers,

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,600
has left tens of millions of yen in debt.

10
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,260
Even if I wanted to break up with him,

11
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,730
if he did such a thing,

12
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,540
I would have a bad reputation.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
I can't do it anymore.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,880
I can't do it.

15
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:14,881
What is it?

16
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,750
Yosuke...

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,790
You've changed, haven't you?

18
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,620
Most of the investment
funds Yosuke collected

19
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,260
came from a man named Nakae,
who runs a venture company.

20
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:13,261
It was a gift from God.

21
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,240
It was a gift from God.

22
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:27,660
I'll pay you back someday.

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,501
You think you can pay me back?

24
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,140
How?

25
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,860
I'll think about it.

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,920
It's impossible.

27
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,160
I had more than 50 million yen.

28
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,161
I was stupid.

29
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,700
I was stupid, too.

30
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,611
Why didn't I notice this Ponzi scheme?

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll make it easy for you this
time, including your repentance.

32
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,181
Of course, there are conditions.

33
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,110
Can you work for me for 50 million yen?

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I'll do anything.

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,230
Please let me work.

36
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,231
Please let me go!

37
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,310
Huh?

38
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,470
It's not you.

39
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,250
The one who works for me is your wife.

40
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,130
Me?

41
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,630
Your wife has been...

42
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,980
What was her name again?

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,790
Tsumugi.

44
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,110
Tsumugi-San, as a
private secretary, will follow

45
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:00,370
my orders unconditionally,
no matter what.

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
No matter what?

47
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,200
You won't do anything weird, right?

48
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,760
I said, no matter what.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
If you don't like it,
let's not talk about it.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,060
If you refuse me even once in
this month, I'll cancel the contract.

51
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,340
That's right. I'll get 50 million yen back.

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
That's all.

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,280
I'll answer you by 22nd.

54
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,700
I've made up my mind.

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
I knew it.

56
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,440
You've decided to go.

57
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,400
But there's no other way
to get the money back.

58
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,721
You don't have to worry about it.

59
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
But...

60
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,020
If Tsumugi does something to her...

61
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,810
It can't be helped.

62
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,130
You have to be prepared.

63
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,370
It's all your fault.

64
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,780
You've been patient for a month.

65
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,100
I can't stand it anymore.

66
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,960
The next day, I went to Nakae's house.

67
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,880
Yosuke followed me because
he was worried about me.

68
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Why did you come here?

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,380
I thought I could do something for you.

70
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
No.

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Go home.

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
But...

73
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,820
Yosuke, go home.

74
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,460
You can do whatever you want.

75
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,831
I don't know how long I can stay.

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,241
Tsumugi, I'm looking forward
to working with you for a month.

77
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,660
Yes, I'm looking forward
to working with you.

78
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Well, let's get naked.

79
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,041
Why don't you become my wife?

80
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,150
Wh...what do you mean?

81
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,930
I mean...

82
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,770
I'm going to take off my
clothes and underwear here.

83
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,530
Wait a minute.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,510
Why would you do that?

85
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,110
I thought you were
going to ask me anything.

86
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,550
Or... You don't want to do it?

87
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,230
But...how much is it?

88
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,710
I got it.

89
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,290
Okay, go home now.

90
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,410
I'll give you 50 million yen next week.

91
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,190
Wait a minute.

92
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,950
I'll do anything for you.

93
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,580
Please don't kill me.

94
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,050
What can I do for you?

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
This is the only angle.

96
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,510
I can't do it so easily.

97
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,130
You know that, right?

98
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,370
Go home.

99
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,170
I understand.

100
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,640
I just need to listen to
you for a month, right?

101
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I see.

102
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,740
Tsumugi has a better
understanding of you than me.

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,960
And she has more courage than you.

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
That's right.

105
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,680
It's only been a month.

106
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,681
I'm just going to use it.

107
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,240
Tsumugi...

108
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:40,160
It's only been a month, so...

109
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,450
Hey, you sit there too.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,180
Then I'll have you naked.

111
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
But you have to hurry.

112
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,580
Tsumugi, you don't have to.

113
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,180
What are you going to do?

114
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,040
Tsumugi...

115
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,090
Let's go home.

116
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,960
You can go home.

117
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,400
What are you going to do?

118
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,670
You have a beautiful body.

119
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,690
Take off your clothes.

120
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,690
Please stop.

121
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I told you to stop.

122
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,550
Your wife is working hard for you.

123
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,551
This is for you.

124
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
This is your underwear.

125
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,160
Stop it, Tsumugi.

126
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,170
What are you going to do?

127
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
Are you going to stop?

128
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Don't hide it.

129
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,660
This is your tongue.

130
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Show me.

131
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,080
Turn around slowly.

132
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,100
What?

133
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,101
What?

134
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Look.

135
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
It's good, isn't it?

136
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,980
First of all, I'd like you
to clean up in this outfit.

137
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
What?

138
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,680
You have to squeeze your genitals well.

139
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,000
I'd like you to clean it up.

140
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,700
Look, it's dirty there.

141
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,240
Yes, put your hips in.

142
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,170
It's dirty there, too.

143
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:07,640
If it's dirty, you have to put it
in water and squeeze it again.

144
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,240
It's dirty here, too.

145
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,510
It's dirty here, too.

146
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:05,250
It's dirty here, too.

147
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,010
If you don't put your hips in
and wipe it, it won't get dirty.

148
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,970
Squeeze it again.

149
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,660
You have to water it properly.

150
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,280
It's beautiful.

151
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:46,220
Tsumugi, thank you.

152
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,620
You're tired because I cleaned
up all of a sudden, right?

153
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
I'll give you a massage.

154
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Sit here.

155
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,800
Don't hesitate to come over here.

156
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,380
Hey, move over there.

157
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,490
You must be tired.

158
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,910
I'll give you a massage.

159
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,270
It's okay.

160
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,260
I'm fine.

161
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,261
I'm fine.

162
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,600
You don't have to be shy.

163
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,900
Tsunugi, please don't do that.

164
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,020
You must be tired because
you have a lot of hair.

165
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
I'm really fine.

166
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,030
So don't be shy.

167
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,031
Don't move.

168
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,310
This is a massage.

169
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Oh, it's hot.

170
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,420
What's wrong?

171
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,150
Oh, it's hot.

172
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Massage my thighs, too.

173
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,620
Oh, it's hot.

174
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,720
I have to massage your thighs.

175
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,380
Natsumi, come on.

176
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,860
I'll give you a foot massage.

177
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,870
I'm going to give you a
good massage, so come on.

178
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,620
What's wrong? You're just giving me a
weird voice and giving me a massage.

179
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,180
Then look at me again.

180
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,830
Come on, put your tongue out.

181
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,970
Hurry up.

182
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,250
Your tongue.

183
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,410
Your tongue.

184
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,640
Your tongue.

185
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:55,700
Come on.

186
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Take it out more.

187
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,460
It's so soft.

188
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,930
Take it out more.

189
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:08,931
What are you doing?

190
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,570
You have a nice tongue.

191
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,250
Look at what your wife is doing.

192
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,750
Look at it with your own eyes.

193
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Look at it carefully.

194
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,650
Lick it.

195
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,410
Look at me.

196
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Look at me.

197
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,580
Look at me.

198
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,900
Look at me.

199
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:15,770
Are you looking at me?

200
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:16,771
Do you feel better?

201
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,150
You feel better because
your husband is gone, right?

202
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,831
Let's continue the
massage Let's continue.

203
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,790
You wanted me to touch
you like this, didn't you?

204
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Look at me.

205
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,950
Come on, your body is honest, so come on.

206
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,010
I fell.

207
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:20,030
It feels good, doesn't it?

208
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,520
You look like you're in a good mood.

209
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,060
Or do you like this better?

210
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,980
Tsumugi, what's this?

211
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
It's a mess.

212
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

213
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,010
What's wrong?

214
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,970
I'm sorry.

215
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:17,971
You're feeling better.

216
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,870
I'm sorry.

217
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,350
I'm sorry.

218
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,210
You can't do it on your own.

219
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,170
You can't do it on your own.

220
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:02,310
Come on Please

221
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,710
Give me a kiss.

222
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,330
Look, I'm going to take out your tongue.

223
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,130
Just like before.

224
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,830
What?

225
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,170
What time is it?

226
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,860
Please lick me.

227
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:14,360
Please lick me.

228
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
That's right.

229
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
Ah!

230
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,050
Ah!

231
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:53,011
Hmm... Ah!

232
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Ah!

233
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
This side too.

234
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,890
Ah!

235
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,650
Ah!

236
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,480
Look closely.

237
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,670
Ah!

238
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,600
Does it feel good?

239
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,650
Hmm!

240
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,510
Ah...

241
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
It feels good, right?

242
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,940
It feels so good.

243
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,120
Did you want to go now?

244
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,400
You were about to go, weren't you?

245
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,660
When you were about to go,
you said you were about to go.

246
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,600
It's hot.

247
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
Please.

248
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,820
What's wrong?

249
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Why are you so irritated?

250
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,300
You can't stand it, can you?

251
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:55,960
What's wrong with you?

252
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:04,640
Does it feel good?

253
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,300
Answer me.

254
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,140
I can't.

255
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,140
I won't forgive you.

256
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,600
Don't say anything.

257
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,630
Do you want me to go?

258
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,730
You don't want to go?

259
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,070
I don't want to go.

260
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,550
What do you say when you want to go?

261
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,510
What do you say?

262
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,450
Let me go.

263
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,151
Say it louder What is it?

264
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,010
See?

265
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,610
You want to go, don't you?

266
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,390
Please let me go.

267
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,990
I said you can go.

268
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:39,250
Let me lick you.

269
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,660
What is this?

270
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,040
Massage me, please.

271
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,050
Lick me more.

272
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:34,470
Do you want me to do it for you?

273
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,270
Do you want me to do it for you?

274
00:38:55,335 --> 00:39:01,350
Do you want me to do it for you?

275
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,420
Let me lick you.

276
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I'm gonna lick you.

277
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
You can eat it all the way to the back.

278
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I don't want to!

279
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Come on!

280
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,750
You can't do it anymore, can you?

281
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,230
Look at me.

282
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,850
Open your legs.

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,580
Manko, open your legs.

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,150
I'm begging you.

285
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,980
I'm begging you to put me in a stroller.

286
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,860
Stroller...

287

It feels so good.

294
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,780
I can't take it anymore.

295

Oh no.

342
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,080
Oh no.

343
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:33,080
Ahhhhh.

344
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,340
Ahhhhh.

345
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,120
Ahhhhh.

346
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:52,240
I can't do this anymore.

347
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:54,060
I can't do this anymore.

348
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:28,110
Ahhhhhh.

349
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,150
Why are you crying?

350
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:24,750
I've never felt like this before.

351
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,490
I had sex with Nakae many times that day.

352
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:38,030
Despite the situation, I kept
feeling like I was forgetting myself.

353
00:57:47,240 --> 00:58:05,180
Are you still awake?

354
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,460
What have you been doing since then?

355
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,570
Do I have to tell you?

356
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,850
You've been doing things
you can't say anyway.

357
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:37,731
You've been doing a
lot of things, haven't you?

358
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,660
I'm tired, so I'm going to take a shower.

359
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,740
You've been doing a
lot of things, haven't you?

360
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,500
You were happy to do a
lot of things, weren't you?

361
00:58:54,501 --> 00:59:01,860
Do you really want to know?

362
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,520
It's a month's patience.

363
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:46,220
I know I can't do it with my
head, but when I remember

364
00:59:46,232 --> 01:00:05,610
the love I received from Nakae,
my body reacts on its own.

365
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,650
Nyaaah!

366
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
Nyaaah!

367
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,930
It feels so good!

368
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,720
Nyaaah!

369
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,380
Ah!

370
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,870
Ah, I'm scared!

371
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,350
I'm scared!

372
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:33,490
Nyaaah!

373
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,350
Nyaaah!

374
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:01,560
Nyaaah!

375
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,980
Nyaaah!

376
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:16,730
After that, every day.

377
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,460
I would get drunk.

378
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,261
I drowned in the play with Nakae.

379
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:39,261
Ah... Ah... Ah...

380
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,561
Ah... Ah...

381
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:01,410
Eventually, the request
from Nakae was escalated.

382
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,720
Tsumugi-San.

383
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:12,920
This is Kobayashi-kun,

384
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,640
Nice to meet you.

385
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,940
What...

386
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:26,120
Kobayashi-kun, you're always
doing your best, aren't you?

387
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:32,360
Today, my private secretary,
Tsumugi-San, will make you feel good.

388
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:36,785
Thank you very much.

389
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,000
Tsumugi-San will do anything if you ask.

390
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,310
Then, please.

391
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:57,700
First, put your clothes on.

392
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:04,000
What are you doing?

393
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,650
Look at her face and do it.

394
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,410
Take off all your clothes.

395
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:54,690
Don't be nervous.

396
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:51,920
Don't be nervous.

397
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,560
Don't be nervous.

398
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:55,480
I won't.

399
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:56,481
Enjoy it.

400
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,460
I won't.

401
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,490
Kiss me gently.

402
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,530
Look at me.

403
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,110
Look at me.

404
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:39,360
Look at me more.

405
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,040
I kissed you because you are
young, but you have a lot of pimples.

406
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,820
Are you happy?

407
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,160
I'm happy.

408
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,130
Then make me feel better.

409
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:36,540
Ask me if I feel good.

410
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:42,000
Do you feel good?

411
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:43,001
Are you okay?

412
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,680
Yes.

413
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,411
I'm glad. I should have licked you more.

414
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:15,780
You're so slow.

415
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,220
Look at me.

416
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,410
What's going on?

417
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,190
What are you going to do?

418
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,360
Can I touch you?

419
01:12:59,361 --> 01:13:00,361
I don't feel anything.

420
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
Let me touch you.

421
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,230
You're drooling.

422
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,660
Let me lick you.

423
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,030
Do you feel better?

424
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,410
Yes.

425
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,630
I'm not a god.

426
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:27,070
It's not what you think it is.

427
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960
What did he do to you?

428
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,326
What did he do to make you feel good?

429
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:34,350
Listen to me.

430
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,350
Make him feel good.

431
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,970
What should I do?

432
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,720
I don't know.

433
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,000
Try to provoke him more.

434
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,440
Be nice to him.

435
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,720
Does it feel good?

436
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:51,730
I'm going to eat it all.

437
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:53,500
Do you want me to kiss you?

438
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:07,220
I'll kiss you.

439
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,470
Hello?

440
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,121
The door is open, so you can come in.

441
01:17:53,475 --> 01:17:54,490
I'm watching you here.

442
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,130
Look, Tsumugi.

443
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,970
I'll do it while looking at you.

444
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,270
Look, I'll do it.

445
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:16,330
Look, I'll do it while looking at you.

446
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,790
Take a good look at it.

447
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,160
You're so excited to be
seen by your husband.

448
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:34,750
It's good.

449
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,490
Is it good?

450
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,980
Yes, it's good.

451
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:51,981
I'm sorry.

452
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:01,910
Oratsumi-San.

453
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,030
Give me a deep kiss.

454
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,210
Wrap your tongue around me.

455
01:20:53,285 --> 01:20:55,360
Look at me.

456
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:58,130
Give me a strong kiss.

457
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,370
Make me feel good.

458
01:21:37,150 --> 01:22:24,441
I can't do this
anymore It's that hard?

459
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:28,080
Then I'll end it here.

460
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,640
I'll give you one last chance.

461
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:48,960
If you can't keep the contract, you
have to pay back the debt several times.

462
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,120
Which one do you choose?

463
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,360
I'll do it.

464
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,400
Please.

465
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,480
Listen.

466
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,560
Don't look away.

467
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,220
If you can't keep the contract,

468
01:23:28,221 --> 01:23:32,340
You don't have to do anything, but
you have to pay me back the damage.

469
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:33,450
OK?

470
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:48,090
I'm watching you.

471
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,840
I'm watching you.

472
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:05,500
I'm watching you while kissing you.

473
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,620
Look at this.

474
01:24:15,665 --> 01:24:16,665
This side, too.

475
01:24:28,645 --> 01:24:30,420
Your neck is already swollen.

476
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:02,920
Do you feel good?

477
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,860
I'll lick you.

478
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:29,000
You have to remove
the gallbladder properly.

479
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:30,001
I'm going to take it off.

480
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,480
It's coming off nicely.

481
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,791
I'm going to support you from behind.

482
01:25:56,915 --> 01:25:58,280
I'm going to take it off.

483
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:14,540
Look, it's so slimy.

484
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:27,980
Show it to him.

485
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:38,101
You're excited to be seen by your husband.

486
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,651
You want him to see you, don't you?

487
01:26:54,665 --> 01:26:55,665
Yes, I do.

488
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:58,930
Come on, you can do it.

489
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,551
I want you to look at all of them.

490
01:27:10,985 --> 01:27:13,440
Look at all of them.

491
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,880
I'm telling you to go when you're going.

492
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,620
You're a good girl, aren't you?

493
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,490
Look at this.

494
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:09,420
Does it feel good?

495
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:29,800
Open your butt.

496
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:30,880
Turn your butt this way.

497
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:40,000
Open your butt.

498
01:29:41,115 --> 01:29:42,520
Open your butt.

499
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,840
Open your butt.

500
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,300
That's right.

501
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:51,531
Open your butt so that
you can see it clearly.

502
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:59,840
Look at me when I'm embarrassed.

503
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:01,121
Look at me when I'm embarrassed.

504
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:02,940
Please.

505
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:07,980
Look at me when I'm embarrassed.

506
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,380
Does it feel good?

507
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:37,040
It feels good.

508
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:50,980
It's been a long time
since I saw you last time.

509
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,760
It's been a long time
since I saw you last time.

510
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:59,040

Look at your husband.

01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:44,220
Look at your husband.

515
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,450
I'm gonna touch your ear.

516
01:32:06,451 --> 01:32:07,451
Your ear is wet.

517
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:42,440
I'm gonna touch your ear.

518
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:03,750

I want to drink
You want to drink?

525
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:35,080
Is it good?

526
01:34:35,081 --> 01:34:36,241
You're going to be all right.

527
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,640
You're going to be all right.

528
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,720
You can't sleep?

529
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,040
You can't sleep?

530
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,041
Wake up.

I have a favorite chimpanzee.

536
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,250
Please sleep.

537
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:30,050
Please sleep.

I'll massage your lower body.

546
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,760
It's hot.

547
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,580
You're happy to be in Japan, right?

548
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:35,420
You love it, don't you?

549
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,280
It's so delicious.

550
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:40,820
I don't like it because it's so small.

551
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,520
Ahhhh.

552
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:54,870

No, I saw it a lot because
my kids are eating so well.

557
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:56,270
I feel like I'm going to lose my mind...

558
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:59,910
I was so happy to eat my
favorite meat and water.

620
01:48:02,111 --> 01:48:04,010
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's disgusting.

621
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:27,250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

622
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:30,530

I want to die.

632
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:25,651
You look so tired.

633
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,610
Look at this.

634
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,410
Don't cry.

01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:43,410

01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:17,760

642
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,610
I'm going to die.

643
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:39,690
I'm going to die.

644
01:52:39,691 --> 01:52:40,691
Why is it so hot?

645
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,400
Let me have a drink.

646
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:23,980
OMG.

647
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:27,520
I can't let you drink it.

648
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:30,280
How can you drink it?

649
01:53:30,355 --> 01:53:31,880
I can't open my eyes!

650
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,090
You're bleeding a lot.

651
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:05,060
You're bleeding a lot.

652
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:12,220
You're bleeding a lot.

653
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:22,420
Come on.

654
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,400
Come here.

655
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:41,540
Why are you whining?

656
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:20,010
Does it feel good?

657
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:22,050
What?

658
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,870
Do you feel good?

659
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:25,210
Yes, I feel good.

660
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:31,750
One shot, two shots, it doesn't change.

661
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:49,740
I'll get you out of here.

662
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:52,880
No, no, no, no.

663
01:57:03,025 --> 01:57:05,850
We were released from Nakae.

664
01:59:01,895 --> 01:59:07,880
After that, Yosuke didn't
come back for a while.

665
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:18,680
I suddenly remembered the time with Nakae
and called her, but Nakae didn't answer.

666
01:59:18,681 --> 01:59:23,120
Even though my body is aching so much.
