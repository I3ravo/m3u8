1
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,190
I came back to the hotel.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,620
Thank you for waiting.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,890
Did you wait for me?

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,110
No, I didn't.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,910
Really? I'm glad.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,870
I'm going to stay here tonight.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm looking forward to it.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,930
You are dressed up.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,990
Yes, I am.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,750
You are so cute.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,330
Thank you.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
I'm glad.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,770
Let's take a lot of pictures
on TikTok and Instagram.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,370
OK.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,430
I want to take a lot of pictures.

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,930
I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,590
Let's take a picture together.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,050
OK.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,810
One, two, three.

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,750
Good.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,110
One more.

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,050
What?

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,330
What?

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,410
Nothing.

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,700
I'm a little embarrassed.

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,240
Are you embarrassed?

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
It's OK.

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,860
Isn't it too early?

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
No, it's not.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,496
Did you take a picture of me?

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,020
Yes, I did.

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,380
I have strange eyes.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,960
Don't worry.

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
You look cool.

35
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,620
Really.

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,900
You have a nice face.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,340
I don't.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Thank you.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,100
Shall we go?

40
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Let's go.

41
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:55,620
My bangs.

42
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,260
You look cute.

43
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,840
Really?

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Not at all.

45
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,750
Do I look good?

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,260
You have a beautiful back.

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Right?

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,426
Do you want to take a picture with me?

49
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:16,950
Really?

50
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,670
Will you take a picture of me?

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,090
Of course.

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,650
Thank you.

53
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,470
One more.

54
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,450
Good.

55
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,320
How is it?

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Is it OK?

57
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
Good.

58
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,020
You are good at taking pictures.

59
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,680
No, I'm not.

60
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:46,700
I'm happy.

61
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,821
You look good in the camera.

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
No, I'm not.

63
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,680
Thank you.

64
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,500
Do you want to see more?

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:51,960
Yes.

66
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,460
Let's see more.

67
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
It's really sunny.

68
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,440
The weather has been bad recently.

69
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,860
So, you have a sunny belly.

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,580
I have a sunny belly.

71
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,460
Good.

72
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm glad that I have a sunny
belly rather than a rainy day.

73
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,940
I'm going to have a lot of fun today.

74
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
I'm going to dress up.

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
You look good.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
Thank you.

77
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,220
You look good in the picture.

78
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,440
You're right.

79
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,100
The shadow of the sun looks good.

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,800
I'll take a picture here.

81
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:26,801
I'll take a picture here.

82
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,110
I'm glad that the
temperature is comfortable.

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,060
You are too close to me.

84
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
No, I'm not.

85
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
No?

86
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,960
No, I'm not.

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm embarrassed.

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Don't be embarrassed.

89
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,360
Look.

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
It's the sea.

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,360
It's the sea.

92
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,361
It's the sea.

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
It's amazing.

94
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's take a picture.

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,920
One more.

96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,320
What?

97
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,440
No, I'm not.

98
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm embarrassed.

99
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,721
You look good.

100
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
You look cute.

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
You look good.

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm embarrassed, too.

103
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,060
Let's take a picture together.

104
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,160
No, I'm not.

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
You look good.

106
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,460
I'll give you 10 seconds.

107
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,960
I can imitate you, right?

108
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Yes.

109
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,610
Let's take a picture together.

110
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,370
You look cute.

111
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,790
I can't imitate you.

112
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,270
I'll take a picture of this as a souvenir.

113
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,590
Where should we go next?

114
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,390
I'm so excited.

115
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,410
It's dangerous.

116
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,910
I'm glad.

117
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,850
What is it?

118
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,910
It's going down.

119
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,930
Let's take a picture.

120
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,510
This is a video.

121
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,490
Look at the fountain.

122
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,510
It's amazing.

123
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,450
It's amazing.

124
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,550
It's amazing.

125
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,290
It's magnificent.

126
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,670
Sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,970
Thank you.

128
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,670
Which one do you like,
orange juice or ginger ale?

129
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,150
Which one?

130
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,370
I want to drink orange juice.

131
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,750
Then, I'll drink this one.

132
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,270
By the way, the manga I read
the other day was interesting.

133
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,870
Really?

134
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,170
Thank you.

135
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,190
I'm glad.

136
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,330
The manga I read the
other day was difficult.

137
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:53,810
I'm glad, too.

138
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,190
You're right.

139
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,590
There are a lot of plots in the manga.

140
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,124
It's strange to say that
it's a long time ago, but it's

141
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,390
getting more difficult than
the manga I read the other day.

142
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,030
You're right.

143
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,110
The manga I read the other day
was simple and easy to understand.

144
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,290
You're right.

145
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,830
The manga I read the other day
is a well-made example, isn't it?

146
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,410
You're right.

147
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,490
I think it's going to be interesting.

148
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,970
It's interesting, but I sometimes
have to look at the conjecture site.

149
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,710
I see.

150
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,811
So, I read the original
manga, look at the site,

151
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,510
understand it, and read
the original manga again.

152
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:46,410
I sometimes do things like
that, but I think it's really difficult.

153
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,410
I want to drink ginger ale, too.

154
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,210
I'll have a sip.

155
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,770
Give me more.

156
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,010
No, thanks.

157
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,650
Give me more.

158
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,651
Give me more.

159
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,430
Thank you.

160
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,610
This is delicious.

161
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,190
You're right.

162
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,410
Now that we're at the
sea, let's go to the sea.

163
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,170
Let's go.

164
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,390
Isn't it huge?

165
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,510
It's huge.

166
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,650
What kind of sea is this?

167
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,090
I don't know the name of this sea.

168
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,650
What kind of sea is this?

169
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:33,651
I don't know.

170
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,510
Now that we're at the sea, I
want to take a picture of TikTok.

171
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,510
Can you take a picture of me?

172
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,850
Sure.

173
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,270
Here we go.

174
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,630
I took it.

175
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,410
How is it?

176
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,330
Isn't it good?

177
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,130
Take a look.

178
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,490
It's really good.

179
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,830
You're really good at taking pictures.

180
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,610
Thank you.

181
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:08,611
Thank you.

182
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,110
It's hard to walk on the
beach, but it's a good exercise.

183
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,630
I've been walking a lot lately.

184
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,190
I've been busy studying lately, so I
haven't been able to exercise much.

185
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,010
When I study, I study.
When I exercise, I exercise.

186
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,411
I have a lot of feelings like that.

187
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,750
We're going to the beach.

188
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,350
It's perfect.

189
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,710
There's a circle.

190
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,790
That's amazing.

191
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,330
Let's take a look.

192
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,070
There used to be a lot of bead masquerade.

193
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,030
Do you want to try it?

194
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,050
I'll do it.

195
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,810
I'll have it as it is.

196
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:55,610
Let's move on to the last one.

197
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,950
I'll do my best.

198
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,310
Which one should I choose?

199
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,610
I'm so nervous.

200
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,990
Why are you so polite all of a sudden?

201
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,390
I don't know.

202
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,230
My hands are shaking.

203
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,690
Oh, my God.

204
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,270
Oh, my God.

205
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,290
I have five left.

206
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:43,190
I have one left.

207
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,030
You're thinking very seriously.

208
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,430
I want that.

209
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,290
This one.

210
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,590
You're a genius, aren't you?

211
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,230
I'll show you again.

212
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,390
It's not fake.

213
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,830
Really.

214
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,190
Here you go.

215
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,490
Thank you.

216
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,670
I was able to see your unexpected talent.

217
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,950
Oh, my God.

218
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,951
It's amazing.

219
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,070
It's Azitasu.

220
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,850
I really like Azitasu.

221
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,030
I want it.

222
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,410
It's a cat of each SNS.

223
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,630
Isn't this mine?

224
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,390
Nyakutoku.

225
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,046
It's raw for the time being.

226
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,190
It's raw for the time being.

227
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,470
It's beer.

228
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,330
Didn't you have anything other than beer?

229
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,510
It's not raw.

230
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,230
I don't drink it.

231
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,110
I want this.

232
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,570
You're quick to decide the size.

233
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,470
I want size M.

234
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,730
I think size M is good.

235
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,090
I think size L is more fluffy and cute.

236
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,730
That's up to you.

237
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,450
Personally, I like the fluffy one.

238
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,490
It's a little big.

239
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,530
It's a good size.

240
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,130
Let's buy it in matching colors.

241
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,570
Matching colors?

242
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,190
Let's choose the color.

243
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,910
I like black and white.

244
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,810
Black and white is good.

245
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,606
I think black and white
goes well with anything.

246
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,630
Let's go.

247
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,410
It's Otsuri.

248
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,570
You bought it.

249
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,250
I bought it.

250
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,790
I'm glad.

251
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,786
Do you have any other
places you want to go?

252
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,810
It's amazing over there.

253
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,890
Let's take a look.

254
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,450
It's rare to have a public phone.

255
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,340
Let's take a picture.

256
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,100
Did you take a picture?

257
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,160
I did.

258
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,220
I took a good picture.

259
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
Stand over there.

260
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,300
It's embarrassing.

261
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,540
It's embarrassing.

262
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:20,840
Is it over?

263
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
It's embarrassing.

264
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
It was really good.

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Really?

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Thank you.

267
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,780
It was really fun.

268
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
What are you doing?

269
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,460
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm hungry.

271
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,080
Let's eat sweet potatoes.

272
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:43,081
Let's eat sweet potatoes.

273
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
That's good.

274
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
What?

275
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
What's wrong?

276
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,920
Shadowverse.

277
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,280
Why are you suddenly there?

278
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,720
I like trading cards.

279
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,560
Do you want to try it?

280
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,616
Switch is amazing when you enter the anime.

281
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,740
Otaku comes out.

282
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,260
You went without hesitation.

283
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
My favorite came out.

284
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
It's like that.

285
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,140
I bought it for the first time.

286
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,300
Thank you.

287
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,180
I want to eat crepe.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,480
Do you want to eat it?

289
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,080
I do.

290
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,120
I'll have caramel custard crepe.

291
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Thank you.

292
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
It's big.

293
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
It's big.

294
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,040
It's good.

295
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,440
It's good.

296
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,980
Do you want to eat it?

297
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,640
It's good.

298
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:39,860
I like it.

299
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,370
I'm glad.

300
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,440
The sunset is amazing.

301
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,020
It's beautiful only here.

302
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,900
It's really beautiful.

303
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,900
I'll go to the hotel.

304
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:04,120
Let's go to the hotel.

305
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,640
It's amazing.

306
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,380
The room is really big.

307
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,460
Isn't it?

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,440
I was surprised.

309
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,960
It's beautiful outside.

310
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,460
Really?

311
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,180
Isn't it amazing?

312
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
It's amazing.

313
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,120
It's really beautiful.

314
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,040
I can see the Tokyo Tower.

315
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,040
It's really beautiful here.

316
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
It's really amazing.

317
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,700
It was scary, wasn't it?

318
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,140
No, it wasn't.

319
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Really?

320
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,340
Thank you for today.

321
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
You're welcome.

322
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,900
I'm embarrassed.

323
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,560
There is a door over there.

324
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
Is that so?

325
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,960
Do you want to go there?

326
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Yes, I'll go there.

327
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
It's amazing.

328
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,000
The bathroom is really big.

329
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh.

330
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,180
It's really beautiful.

331
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,860
It's amazing.

332
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,880
It's really beautiful here.

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Isn't it amazing?

334
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,220
It's amazing.

335
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm excited.

336
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,780
I'll take a shower.

337
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Wait a minute.

338
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,020
Don't look at me.

339
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:46,200
Don't look at me.

340
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,770
Okay.

341
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,460
What were you looking at?

342
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,730
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,080
Don't look at me.

344
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
Do you want to take a bath together?

345
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,770
Yes.

346
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,180
You looked at my naked body.

347
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,220
Show me your naked body.

348
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
What?

349
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
Don't you like it?

350
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
No, I don't like it.

351
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Cheers.

352
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
What?

353
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,340
It was a prank.

354
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,420
I had a lot of fun today.

355
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
You're right.

356
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Thank you.

357
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,860
That vending machine was the most fun.

358
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
That's right.

359
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
Let's go.

360
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
You're kind.

361
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm not kind.

362
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm not kind.

363
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I'm normal.

364
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
What?

365
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,280
What?

366
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
What?

367
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,220
This is normal kindness.

368
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,500
Really?

369
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm happy.

370
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,640
You're polite sometimes, aren't you?

371
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
That's right.

372
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
It's a habit.

373
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,300
I have to be polite
because I'm not good at it.

374
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,500
You have to close your eyes.

375
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
Take off your pants.

376
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,460
I'm embarrassed.

377
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Why?

378
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Don't be embarrassed.

379
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
Let's go in.

380
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Do you want to go in?

381
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,300
What?

382
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Do you like it?

383
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Are you okay?

384
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,700
Yes, I'm okay.

385
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
Yes, I'm okay.

386
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,880
You're going to wash me?

387
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,990
I'm embarrassed.

388
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,220
I can't wash you.

389
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
It's warm.

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,580
Is it warm?

392
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,120
I feel like I'm in the toilet.

393
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
I feel like I'm in the toilet.

394
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:52,101
Don't mess with me.

395
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,650
Do you like it?

396
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,030
I like it.

397
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,330
I'll wash you next.

398
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,490
That's right.

399
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,610
What?

400
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,570
Let's take a picture.

401
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,110
A picture?

402
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,390
I have to take a picture.

403
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,910
Let's take a video.

404
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,670
Let's take a video.

405
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,990
That's good.

406
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,890
I'll hide the important parts.

407
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,530
The background is very nice.

408
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,970
That's good.

409
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,370
It tickles.

410
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:40,705
Don't mess with me.

411
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,730
It tickles.

412
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm standing.

413
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,490
I'm standing.

414
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,590
Take a picture of me.

415
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,030
Okay.

416
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,110
It tickles.

417
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,780
Are you shaking?

418
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm shaking.

419
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Let's take a picture.

420
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,460
I can't take a picture.

421
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,780
I can't take a picture at all.

422
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,260
Stop it.

423
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
I can't take a picture.

424
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I can't take a picture.

425
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,110
I'm embarrassed.

426
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Stop it.

427
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,310
I won't stop.

428
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:51,311
I can't take a picture.

429
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,710
I like this place.

430
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
You look good.

431
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,770
I'm embarrassed.

432
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,840
I'm embarrassed.

433
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:40,841
You're getting bigger.

434
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,480
Don't say that.

435
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
I'm embarrassed.

436
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,820
You're so cute.

437
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:49,821
Don't say that.

438
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,170
I won't.

439
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,620
Don't mess with me.

440
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,080
It feels good.

441
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,780
I feel good.

442
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,860
It tickles.

443
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:30,861

It tickles.

448
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,960
You're mean.

449
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,220
It feels good.

450
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,760
It tickles.

451
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,620

I'm happy.

464
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,660
I've seen you many times.

465
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm embarrassed.

466
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,420
You fell.

467
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
I fell.

468
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:47,920

I'll give it back to you.

477
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:21,611
Does your ear feel good?

478
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,950
You know that.

479
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,790
It tickles.

480
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,070
You've grown up.

Do you like it?

490
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:24,690
I don't like it.

491
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:53,090
It's delicious.

492
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,100
It's delicious.

493
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
What are you going to do?

494
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,460
Do you want me to put it in here?

495

Let's go there and continue.

505
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
What?

It tickles.

507
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,376
I'm nervous in a place like this.

508
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,220
It's different from usual.

509
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:06,945
Do you want me to put it in here?

510
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,810
It feels good.

511

Look at me.

514
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:01,190
Don't do that.

515
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:04,390
You're so mischievous.

516
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:10,810

Why do you like it?

524
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Do you like it?

525
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,460
Do you want me to do more?

526
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,400
Do as much as you want.

527
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:15,760
You're dressed up.

528
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,340
I've never dressed up like this.

529
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
It feels strange.

530
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,370
You look excited.

531
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,880
I'm excited.

532
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,290
It tickles.

533
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
It feels good.

534
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,640
Look at me.

535
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,060
It tickles.

536
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:21,820
It feels good.

537
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,810
Your face is cute.

538
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,610
Don't do that.

539
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,690
Does it feel good?

540
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,650
It tickles.

541
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:02,580
It tickles.

542
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,920
It tickles.

543
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:23,910
It feels good.

544
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,130
It tickles.

545
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,390
It tickles.

546
00:42:39,630 --> 00:43:00,140
It tickles.

547
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:10,100
It feels good.

548
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,260
Wait a minute.

549
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,180
What?

550
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,900
Do you want to move again?

551
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Yes.

552
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:17,585
I want to move.

553
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,420
It feels good.

554
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,640
I like this.

555
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,640
It feels good.

556
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,560
It tickles.

557
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,220
It tickles.

558
00:44:51,790 --> 00:45:05,790
It feels good.

559
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,170
It feels good.

560
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,630
I feel good, too.

561
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,290
I love you.

562
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,810
I love you, too.

563
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,450
It feels good.

564
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,930
It tickles.

565
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,450
It tickles.

566
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Look at me.

567
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,240
I love you.

568
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,000
I love you, too.

569
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:48,350
I love you.

570
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,590
I can't stand it.

571
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,450
It tickles.

572
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,540
You put a lot of it.

573
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
I'm sorry.

574
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,100
It's okay.

575
00:48:03,495 --> 00:48:04,580
It felt good.

576
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,196
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

577
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,220
Yes.

578
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,280
I made you dirty again.

579
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,520
It's okay.

580
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,420
What's wrong?

581
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:31,421
What's wrong?

582
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,720
I'll wipe it for you.

583
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,170
Thank you.

584
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,090
Does it tickle?

585
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,150
No, it's okay.

586
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,430
I'm sorry.

587
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,590
It's clean now.

588
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,171
We have to take a shower again.

589
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,290
Let's go together.

590
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,750
Shall we?

591
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:14,180
Let's go.

592
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,200
I'm happy.

593
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,980
I'm going to sleep.

594
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,880
Are you going to sleep?

595
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,760
No, I'm not.

596
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,400
Look at this.

597
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,880
The night view is amazing.

598
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,300
No way.

599
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:45,570
Look.

600
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:47,730
Come here.

601
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,150
It's amazing.

602
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,250
It's amazing, isn't it?

603
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,810
I was surprised that
there was a lot of nature.

604
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,770
The buildings in the back feel like Tokyo.

605
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,670
It's beautiful over there, too.

606
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,810
You're right.

607
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,510
Why don't we go for a walk outside?

608
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:11,990
Shall we go?

609
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:13,090
Let's go.

610
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,870
Let's go for a walk outside.

611
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,010
I like the atmosphere of the night.

612
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,070
It's different from daytime.

613
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,870
I'm hungry.

614
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,630
What should we eat?

615
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,330
The hotel was expensive, wasn't it?

616
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,230
Do you want to eat something?

617
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,070
There's a convenience store over there.

618
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,790
A convenience store?

619
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,530
Yes, let's go to a convenience store.

620
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,470
I came all the way here.

621
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,110
You don't have to.

622
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,990
The hotel was expensive, wasn't it?

623
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,750
I'm happy to hear that.

624
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,030
But... You don't have to.

625
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,290
The convenience store
bento is delicious, so let's go.

626
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,290
Do you really want to go
to a convenience store?

627
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,850
You don't have to.

628
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,870
What do you want to eat?

629
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,070
What do you want to eat?

630
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,590
Don't you need alcohol?

631
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:11,591
Don't you need alcohol?

632
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,670
I just want to drink.

633
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,690
My best recommendation is grilled udon.

634
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,570
Grilled udon?

635
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:18,650
I don't think so.

636
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,290
There's grilled udon.

637
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:21,910
Really?

638
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:23,170
Isn't this it?

639
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,270
This is it.

640
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,810
I'll have grilled udon.

641
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,290
Will you bring it to me?

642
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:31,690
Of course.

643
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:32,890
Thank you.

644
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,010
I want to eat dessert.

645
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,650
What about alcohol?

646
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,510
I'll drink alcohol, too.

647
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:42,590
I'll drink less alcohol.

648
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:43,650
I'll drink less alcohol.

649
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,270
I'll drink less alcohol.

650
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,390
I'll buy two kinds of sweets.

651
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,870
I'd like a bag, please.

652
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,810
Is this okay?

653
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,190
Yes, it's okay.

654
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:58,790
You bought a lot.

655
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,730
Yes, I did.

656
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,190
Give me your hand.

657
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:04,191
Give me your hand?

658
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,110
It's the season of illumination.

659
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:07,630
That's right.

660
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:08,590
Time flies.

661
00:52:08,591 --> 00:52:09,990
It's been a year.

662
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,390
Time flies.

663
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,270
Did you really buy this?

664
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,330
Yes, I did.

665
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,150
Why?

666
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,370
I wanted to eat something
delicious with you.

667
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,350
But it's a delicious dish.

668
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:34,530
I'm embarrassed.

669
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,190
Don't say that.

670
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:39,590
I'm sorry.

671
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,170
It's okay.

672
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,930
I'm embarrassed now.

673
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,300
Don't make a strange face.

674
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,060
I'm sorry.

675
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,420
Make a cool face.

676
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,140
I'll laugh at you.

677
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Why?

678
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,620
That's not true.

679
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,740
We took a lot of pictures.

680
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,440
We took a great picture.

681
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,140
Look at this.

682
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,020
It's good.

683
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,800
It's good, isn't it?

684
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,340
This is...

685
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
I got it.

686
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,920
I'll keep this a secret.

687
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:30,620
To whom?

688
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,540
I'll keep this a secret.

689
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,900
It's my secret.

690
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,320
I think it's about half.

691
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,380
You're right.

692
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
I'll keep this a secret.

693
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,440
Thank you so much for today.

694
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,780
I want you to cheer me up.

695
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,400
Can I attack you a lot?

696
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,560
I'll take it off.

697
00:54:09,330 --> 00:55:26,970
I'll take it off.

698
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,650
It's already this big.

699
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:48,060
You're so cute.

700
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,210
Do you feel good?

701
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,300
You're delicious.

702
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,190
Are you happy?

703
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,900
I like being patted on the head.

704
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:46,590
I'll pet you a lot.

705
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:24,730
I'll pet you a lot.

706
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:25,810
You're so cute.

707
01:00:29,165 --> 01:00:31,910
Do you feel good?

708
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,900
How about this?

709
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:16,690
Do you feel good?

710
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,681
Why are you holding back your face?

711
01:02:34,965 --> 01:02:36,166
Do you want to show your face?

712
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,220
Do you want me to lick you?

713
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,340
What should I do?

714
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Is this okay?

715
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,110
Do you feel good?

716
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,610
You can put it in your mouth.

717
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,270
Wow, you put a lot in your mouth.

718
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,230
I'm hungry, so let's go eat meat.

719
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:23,730
You put too much out.

720
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,730
Thank you for the meal.

721
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,050
Do you want a toast?

722
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:42,650
I'm not good at
drinking, so I'll put it here.

723
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,090
No, it's okay.

724
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,610
Can you open it?

725
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,990
I opened it.

726
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:51,045
Cheers.

727
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,890
It's delicious.

728
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,690
It's delicious.

729
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:03,150
Thank you for the meal.

733
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,040
What salad are you eating?

734
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,850
Seaweed salad.

735
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,500
Seaweed is good for dieting.

736
01:07:33,985 --> 01:07:36,260
I don't feel like dieting.

737
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:38,960
You don't have to do that.

738
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:40,620
Really?

739
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,480
Give me a bite.

740
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
I want to be healthy.

741
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:50,530
It's delicious.

742
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,020
You recommend it, don't you?

743
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,250
Do you want to eat vegetables?

744
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,420
Give me a carrot.

745
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,860
I'll give you a carrot and udon.

746
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,020
Carrot and udon are delicious.

747
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,820
It's delicious.

748
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,660
It's really delicious.

749
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,940
I had a lot of fun today.

750
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:33,580
I feel like I've had a lot of
dates I've never had before.

751
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,320
Thank you so much for today.

752
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,900
Are you happy to pat my head?

753
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,410
Yes.

754
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,140
I'm going to sleep a lot today.

755
01:09:10,335 --> 01:09:12,660
My ears tickle.

756
01:09:12,661 --> 01:09:13,661
It hurts.

757
01:09:19,995 --> 01:09:24,360
I've never been touched like this.

758
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
It tickles.

759
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,130
Let's kiss.

760
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,550
I had a lot of fun today.

761
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:29,570
Thank me.

762
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,180
Do you feel good?

763
01:10:52,345 --> 01:10:53,360
I'll lick you a lot.

764
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,240
I had a lot of fun today.

765
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,500
I want to have a lot of dates again.

766
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:37,920
It tickles.

767
01:11:52,850 --> 01:12:06,380

I'm going to give you a massage.

01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,980
Let me do it.

772

Do you feel good?

Do you feel good?

01:18:52,905 --> 01:18:57,110
I want you to lick me, too.

786
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:16,210
Don't spread your legs.

787
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:17,950
It's embarrassing.

788
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:50,640
It feels good.

Don't do that.

01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,570
Don't do that.

792
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:24,380
I'll be on top of you.

793
01:21:38,045 --> 01:21:39,840
I'm on top of you.

794

Thank you so much for today.

815
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,140
I was so happy.

816
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,160
Good night.

817
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:29,990
Good night.

818
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:40,650
What did you do?

819
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:47,820
You were sleeping.

It's embarrassing.

823
01:35:18,115 --> 01:35:20,290
Why did you get so big in the morning?

824
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,170
You're amazing.

825
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
You're so energetic.

827
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:59,360
Is this breakfast?

828
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,010
I'm full.

829
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:57,050

What?

836
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:27,120
Do you like this?

837
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:41,230
I was surprised.

838
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,380
But I'm a little excited.

839
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,800

I've never been seen this much.

844

Don't look at me like that.

845
01:40:25,821 --> 01:40:26,901
Don't look at me like that.

846
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:36,590
I'm going to get bigger.

847
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:39,540
It tickles.

848
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,800
No, no, no.

No, no, no.

850
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:56,760
No, no, no.

851
01:41:56,761 --> 01:41:59,120
No, no, no.

852
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:24,710
You look like this in the morning.

853

I'm sorry.

857
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:43,220
I didn't go to the bathroom in the morning.

858
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,330
This is against the rules.

859

Don't look at me like that.

873
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:53,450
I'm scared.

874
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:56,500
It's gone.

875
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:19,920
It tickles.

This feels good.

01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:10,080
It tickles.

882
01:52:43,095 --> 01:52:45,810
It tickles.

883
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:45,470

888
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:23,420
It hurts.

889
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:27,480
I've said a lot.

890
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,060
It feels good.

891
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:43,020
I love you.

01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:00,230
I've said a lot.

893
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,400
It feels good in the morning.

894
01:57:31,690 --> 01:57:32,690
I love you.

895
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:47,260
Thank you for everything since yesterday.

Thank you so much.

900
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,480
Look at my cell phone.

901
01:57:58,481 --> 01:58:00,520
Look at my cell phone.

902
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,580
Did you notice?

903
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:13,860
You made my face.

904
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:21,240
Can I take a picture of my cell phone?

905
01:58:21,241 --> 01:58:24,540
Can I take a picture of my cell phone?

906
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:31,320
Make a cool face.

What should I do after this?

911
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:11,970
Do you want to come to my house?

912
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:17,490
It's embarrassing.

913
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:21,230
Let's continue a lot today.
