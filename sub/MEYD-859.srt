1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,700
What a big house!

2
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,071
Isn't it nice? It's a guest house.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
This kind of house is going to be popular.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,760
My husband, Mr. Shusuke,
runs a company in Tokyo.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
As a housewife, I lived
in an apartment in Tokyo.

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,300
He was living a carefree life.

7
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,240
He heard that his company's
business was booming,

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,620
so he decided to start a
guest house as a new business.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,420
You're going to be the hostess here.

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,000
How's that? You're excited, aren't you?

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,740
Yes, I am.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,300
Mr. Shusuke is the type of person
who does whatever comes to his mind.

13
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,113
I'm the type of person who acts
on impulse, and I just found out

14
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,860
that I was going to start this
guest house just the other day.

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,137
I'm excited and nervous
about what's going to happen

16
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:15,080
next, even though I'm being
swayed by Shusuke-San.

17
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:17,745
I'm having a fun married life.

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,400
I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,780
I think I need a little cleaning.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Oh, I see.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,340
The interior work is done, so I'll do
the rest of the work for the opening.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,720
I want you to do the cleaning.

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,280
Oh, I got it.

24
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,480
But isn't it hard for you to
do both work and cleaning?

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,900
What?

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,480
Oh, well, it's hard, but it's okay.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,220
All right, let's get started.

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,540
Yeah, let's do it.

29
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,541
Let's go in.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
How is it?

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Wow!

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
It's amazing!

33
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm going to bring the
documents to the pharmacy.

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,460
Okay. Be careful.

35
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,580
I'll be back soon.

36
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
See you.

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,430
I found you.

38
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,250
Futaba Shunsuke.

39
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,100
The persimmon is delicious.

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,700
I don't know if it's a girl or a man.

41
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,620
But I'm going to go see for myself.

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Excuse me?

43
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,400
Oh, hello.

44
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,400
I got lost on the road.

45
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,300
Could you get me a glass of water?

46
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Oh, go ahead.

47
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,700
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,601
I'm sorry, but I can't let you
stay in a woman's house.

49
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
Don't worry about it.

50
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,400
It's not open yet, but
this is a guest house.

51
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,040
So, please take your time.

52
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,540
My husband hasn't gone out yet.

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,700
Please come in.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Thank you.

55
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,700
Please come in.

56
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:23,980
Please come in.

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Thank you.

58
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,580
The water is delicious.

59
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,460
So, you're opening a guest house in Gokufu?

60
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,420
Yes, I am.

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,460
I said it before, but it's not open yet.

62
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,760
It's a good place.

63
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,520
It's a really good place.

64
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,520
I was born and raised in Tokyo.

65
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,727
I've never been to a
place like this in the

66
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:05,480
mountains, but it's a
really nice place, isn't it?

67
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,140
The air is delicious, it's very
peaceful, and it's comfortable to live in.

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,840
I don't usually do this, so I don't enjoy
this kind of nature, so I feel really good.

69
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,981
Did you come here for a tour?

70
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,500
Well, I had a little business.

71
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,501
We have a guest house.

72
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,520
I didn't know that.

73
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,480
It's good to have a lot
of nature around here.

74
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,320
My husband and I have a guest house.

75
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
We moved here from Tokyo recently.

76
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,490
I see.

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Tokyo?

78
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,390
Yes.

79
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,700
My husband told me
that he has a guest house.

80
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,280
I didn't know that.

81
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,740
I didn't know that.

82
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:52,700
Did your husband quit his job?

83
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,320
No, he has a company in Tokyo.

84
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,320
It seems that his company is doing well.

85
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,740
So I came here again.

86
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,300
Is that so?

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,760
It's going well.

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,600
Is that so?

89
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,460
Is something wrong?

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
No, no.

91
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,380
I thought that your husband
was a person who could work.

92
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,701
I thought you were a good person.

93
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,340
You're like a hard worker.

94
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
I see.

95
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,380
Well, I have to go.

96
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,760
Can you go now?

97
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,621
If you don't mind, you
can stay a little longer.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,020
No, I'm busy.

99
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,700
Don't worry about me.

100
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
I see.

101
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,520
Please come again if you like.

102
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll come again.

103
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Yes.

104
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,880
I'll stay at your place next time.

105
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,440
If you come here.

106
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,620
Thank you very much.

107
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,240
Thank you very much.

108
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,900
I hope I can come here soon.

109
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,380
Hello, I'm Matsuzaki.

110
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,040
Thank you for your request.

111
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,420
I'll make a reservation.

112
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:33,880
I'll take care of the rest.

113
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,580
Yes, I understand.

114
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,280
But, is it true?

115
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,860
You let a woman go and get a reward.

116
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Do you really have money?

117
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Of course.

118
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,695
Revenge for the president who
ran away from the employees.

119
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,380
And...

120
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
My wife died.

121
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,540
It's time for that man to pay for it.

122
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,941
The time has come for you to do it.

123
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,120
I know. I believe in your words.

124
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,300
Then I'll do it.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I'm counting on you.

126
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Leave it to me.

127
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Yes, sir.

128
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,380
Is this real?

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,620
It's real, isn't it?

130
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Are you serious?

131
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,500
You can do anything.

132
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm looking forward to it.

133
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,500
It's good.

134
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,460
Really? I'm glad.

135
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm glad.

136
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,800
You ate a lot, didn't you?

137
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Yes, I did.

138
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,780
By the way, there was a visitor at noon.

139
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,660
A visitor? What kind of visitor?

140
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:00,701
What do you want me to do?

141
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,140
Well, there was a customer
who got lost on the street.

142
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,440
He was just talking to you.

143
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,880
And he said he'd come
back when the store is open.

144
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,660
Oh, I see.

145
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I'll just...

146
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:18,560
Well, whatever.

147
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Just...

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,460
But I think you should advertise
this comic book store more.

149
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,720
On the Internet.

150
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:29,720
No, you can't do that.

151
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,230
I mean, you can't do that.

152
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,600
You know, this kind of place is far away
from the hustle and bustle of the city.

153
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
So, don't advertise it.

154
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,325
It's like getting to know someone you know.

155
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I see.

156
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,600
But there are a lot of people who
collect information on SNS these days.

157
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,620
I'm making a website now.

159
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:57,960
Oh, you're right.

160
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,960
So, only people who want to stay
can search, come here and stay.

161
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Oh, I see.

162
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,755
Oh, there's a reservation.

163
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,370
What? Oh, you're right.

164
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,386
There's a reservation for two
nights and three days on the first day.

165
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:18,930
Wow!

166
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:19,931
You're amazing!

167
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,690
Actually, I told my friends about the guest
house in the apartment I used to live in.

168
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,650
Maybe that's why they made a reservation.

169
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,770
What?

170
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:41,530
I'm sorry.
I told you it's a secret, but I told you.

171
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,370
It's okay. I can tell my friends.

172
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,371
I can talk to you.

173
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,610
Really?

174
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,110
I'm glad.

175
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,430
I have to do my best.

176
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,050
I'm looking forward to it.

177
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,990
Me, too.

178
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,190
I wonder how it will be.

179
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,630
Me, too.

180
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
I'm sure it'll be fine.

181
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
What's wrong?

182
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,820
Nothing.

183
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:12,821
What are you laughing at?

184
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm looking forward to it.

185
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,640
We have to start cleaning from tomorrow.

186
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
That's right.

187
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I'll do my best.

188
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,180
I'll do my best, too.

189
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,460
Let's do our best together.

190
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,800
And we split up our roles.

191
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,147
While sharing the burden,
we organized this small

192
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,760
house, and welcomed the
opening day of the guest house.

193
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Here it is.

194
00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:14,800
We have a guest.

195
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,510
What?

196
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Guest?

197
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm the guest?

198
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:22,741
We're ready.

199
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
This is a good place.

200
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,100
This is a good place.

201
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,280
This is a good place.

202
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,120
I'm in charge of the reservation.

203
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,516
I'll make a reservation for 3 people.

204
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,020
I'll make a reservation for 3 people.

205
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,460
The customers are amazing.

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
You know what?

207
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,160
Today is the grand opening.

208
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,300
I hope the first day won't come.

209
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,660
That's a bad thing.

210
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:51,741
What are you talking about?

211
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Don't get me wrong!

212
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I've lost so many times.

214
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
It's the first day.

215
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,860
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,500
It's the first day.

217
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,320
Then, this way, please.

218
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
No, no, no.

219
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,420
Let's go to the room later.

222
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,840
Later?

223
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:17,020
What did you do to him?

224
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,540
Come on!

225
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,660
Zamanu.

226
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,020
Where is he?

227
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,740
Zamanu, I'll prepare it.

228
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Hurry up, Gijin!

229
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,320
Where is Mom?

230
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:44,680
... ...

231
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,890
...

232
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,730
... ...

233
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,350
What are you doing?

234
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,490
Cheers!

235
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,870
Cheers!

236
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,710
Congratulations!

237
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,250
Thank you very much.

238
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,530
It's amazing.

239
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,030
We are so great.

240
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,870
We are.

241
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,470
It's over.

242
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,890
Thank you very much.

243
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:32,070
Eat, eat.

244
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,670
Eat.

245
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,250
What?

246
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,970
Wow.

247
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,270
You can eat.

248
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,710
You can eat.

249
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,630
You are great.

250
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,030
One more time.

251
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Eat.

252
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Well,

253
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm not that strong.

254
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,000
I can do it.

255
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,200
I can do it.

256
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,140
Here you go, ma'am.

257
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,920
I have work to do.

258
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Here you go, ma'am.

259
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,280
I'll drink this.

260
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,700
Don't drink too much.

261
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I'm fine.

262
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Here you go, ma'am.

263
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
Show your manliness.

264
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,980
Please stop.

265
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:33,981
Can you do it for me?

266
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Skinship?

267
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm not a skinship.

268
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,140
I'm a skinship.

269
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm a skinship.

270
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Hug.

271
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm a skinship.

272
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,040
I'm a skinship.

273
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,380
I'm a skinship.

274
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,140
Are you okay?

275
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
A little.

276
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,960
He fell asleep.

277
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,580
He fell asleep.

278
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
It's dangerous.

279
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
It's dangerous.

280
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,570
It's dangerous.

281
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,930
It's dangerous.

282
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,610
I'm not strong.

283
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,490
It doesn't matter.

284
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,510
I have a lot of work to do.

285
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,670
It doesn't matter.

286
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,350
I have a lot of work to do.

287
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:59,190
Here you are.

288
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,431
Take a picture of your husband.

289
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,710
I'll wipe it off.

290
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,970
Here it comes.

291
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,890
It's going to smell even worse.

292
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,370
Here you are.

293
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,130
Let's have a toast.

294
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,750
Cheers.

295
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,470
I'll help you.

296
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,730
Thank you.

297
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:29,450
Thank you Cheers.

298
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,120
This is good

299
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,480
Please stop.

300
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,290
Service is bad I don't
want to go to Ginza.

301
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,530
Ginza is lonely.

302
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,410
It's not that kind of place.

303
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,290
It's not Ginza.

304
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,710
No, it's not.

305
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,890
I don't want to go there.

306
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,070
There's no such place.

307
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,990
You're so cute.

308
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,730
Wait.

309
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,030
Wait.

310
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,890
Wait.

311
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,090
Please don't.

312
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,230
Wait.

313
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,830
Please don't.

314
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,750
No.

315
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:26,990
Come here.

316
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,630
Come here.

317
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,110
Please stop it.

318
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,130
I have to go back to work.

319
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,410
Please stop it.

320
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,330
I got it.

321
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,070
I won't push you.

322
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,610
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

323
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,430
Rock-paper-scissors.

324
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Rock-paper-scissors.

325
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,330
Hey, I won.

326
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,050
Stop it.

327
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,350
No, no, no.

328
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,810
You've been playing
rock-paper-scissors for a long time.

329
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,730
If you win, it's a reward.

330
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,610
That's right.

331
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,150
Hey.

332
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Stop it.

333
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Please stop.

334
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,440
Hey, hey, hey.

335
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:23,860
Hey.

336
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,180
It smells good.

337
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:26,181
What are you doing?

338
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,160
What are you doing?

339
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
Stop it!

340
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,820
Stop it!

341
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Please stop it!

342
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
She wants you to stop it.

343
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,320
No!

344
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,180
Don't go wild.

345
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,480
You'll get drunk.

346
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
No!

347
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,200
Stop it!

348
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:54,520
Please eat this.

349
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,480
No, no, no.

350
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
Let's enjoy it.

351
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,530
Thank you.

352
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,390
It's delicious.

353
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,790
You are so soft.

354
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,791
Good girl.

355
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,650
I'll do a good thing.

356
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,470
What is it?

357
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,350
I'll soak you in water.

358
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,550
Good.

359
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,750
The water will splash.

360
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,090
I'll do it.

361
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,810
I'll do it.

362
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,810
Don't cry.

363
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,370
Don't cry.

364
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,670
Be careful.

365
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,450
Is it good?

366
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,270
Ah.

367
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,700
She is crying.

368
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,120
It's hard.

369
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:07,661
Don't cry Don't cry.

370
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:24,350
It's hard Thank you
for your hard work.

371
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,990
Did you eat my nose?

372
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,630
Please sit here.

373
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,410
Do you see this?

374
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,590
How do you feel when you stand?

375
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,030
This is a misunderstanding.

376
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,710
Please wake up.

377
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,230
Give it to me.

378
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,710
No, no, no.

379
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,890
You're going wild.

380
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,670
You have a good spirit.

381
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,330
It's hot.

382
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,900
Please stop.

383
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,640

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Stop it!

388
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,320
Oh, it's broken.

389
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
It's broken.

390
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,070
It's broken.

391
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,150
Come on, come on.

392
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,130
Eh?

393
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,650
I'll take it off.

394
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,290
I'll take it off.

395
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,790
I'm scared.

396
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,130
I'm scared.

397
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,830
I'm scared.

398
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,230
I'm scared.

399
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,930
Don't be aggressive.

400
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,830
Don't be aggressive.

401
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,970
I can't feel anything.

402
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,550
I'm scared.

403
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,270
Don't do that.

404
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,630
Don't do that.

405
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,710
Come on, come on, come on.

406
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,230
Isn't it shining?

407
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,890
What is this?

408
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,110
It's not broken.

409
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,730
Hey, it's broken.

410
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,930
Ah!

411
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,550
Ah!

412
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,550
Ah!

413
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:20,890
Ah!

414
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,210
Ah!

415
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,550
Ah!

416
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,890
Ah!

417
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,370
Ah!

418
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:24,790
Ah!

419
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,350
Ah!

420
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,390
Ah!

421
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,730
Ah!

422
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,270
Don't do that.

423
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:06,120
It smells so good.

424
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,320
She is wearing a very dirty underwear.

425
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,040
What is this?

426
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,920
It's a guest house, isn't it?

427
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
There's a housekeeper.

428
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Put your butt here.

429
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,800
Put your butt here.

430
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,780
Oh, that's good.

431
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
That's good.

432
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,320
Full service.

433
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,840
Full service.

434
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:41,180
What's wrong?

435
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
No!

436
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,440
You're wearing a nice hat, aren't you?

437
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:51,060
You're wearing such a sexy hat.

438
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
This is good.

439
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
You're eating a lot.

440
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,020
It's comfortable, isn't it?

441
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,380
It's comfortable, isn't it?

442
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,840
You're eating a lot.

443
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Good boy.

444
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,780
Good boy.

445
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,080
Good boy.

446
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,660
Good boy.

447
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,220
You have a good butt.

448
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,900
You are a good host.

449
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,860
A lot of guests will come.

450
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,830
Do you feel good?

451
00:28:52,831 --> 00:29:09,200
Let go of me!

452
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,280
Let go of me!

453
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,500
Stretch your legs.

454
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,380
Stretch your legs.

455
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,080
What are you doing?

456
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Please stop.

457
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,340
I don't want to see it,
I don't want to see it.

458
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,140
Then, do you want to have a drink?

459
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,700
I want to drink wakame sake.

460
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
Wakame sake.

461
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Do you allow it?

462
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,620
Wakame sake.

463
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,100
Do you allow it?

464
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
I don't want to see it.

465
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,620
I don't want to see it.

466
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,900
Close it properly.

467
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,540
I don't want to see it.

468
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,640
I can't do it anymore.

469
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:00,641
I can't do it anymore.

470
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,610
Stop it.

471
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,530
Stop it.

472
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,070
Stop it.

473
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,330
Hey, Kuro-chan.

474
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,830
Oh, no!

475
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,090
She has become so wet.

476
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,730
Let me help you.

477
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,370
Come on, Kuro-chan.

478
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:01,371
Come on, come on.

479
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:05,570
I beg you.

480
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,590
Wait, wait, wait.

481
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,110
It's too early.

482
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,690
My wife is...

483
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
My wife is so heavy.

484
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,250
So...

485
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,190
I beg you.

486
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,510
Let me go.

487
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,270
I have work to do.

488
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:27,850
It's okay.

489
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,050
Yes.

490
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,690
I'm sorry.

491
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,570
How is it?

492
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,930
How is it?

493
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,290
Is it good?

494
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,570
It's good.

495
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,050
Give me more.

496
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,530
Give me more.

497
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,970
Give me more.

498
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,470
Give me more.

499
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,570
I'm sorry.

500
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,990
A little more.

501
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:23,991
Let's add more water.

502
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,450
Mrs.
Koyama is calmer when she makes a voice.

503
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,050
That's good.

504
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:42,230
Come on, Mrs. Koyama.

505
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,610
Come on, get up.

506
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,690
Come on, get up.

507
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:10,950
What's wrong? Why are you lying down?

508
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,890
You're just like me.

509
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,251
The sound of the tree has changed.

510
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,190
The sound of the tree has changed.

511
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,710
I don't know if it's the
sound of the grass.

512
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,670
To the back.

513
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,460
It's shaking.

514
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,100
Good, good, good.

515
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,120
It's coming out.

516
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
It's coming out.

517
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,100
I think it's stuck in your stomach.

518
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,980
It's coming out.

519
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,100
Oh, it's coming out.

520
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
More, more.

521
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,200
Sit down, sit down.

522
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Sit down, sit down.

523
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,760
Let's go to the room.

524
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,680
Let's go to the room.

525
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,180
Yes, yes.

526
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Yes, yes, ma'am.

527
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,600
Stop it.

528
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,600
It's slippery.

529
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,500
Stop it.

530
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,840
Come on!

531
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Relax!

532
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Relax!

533
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,950
It's starting!

534
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,430
It's starting!

535
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,150
Relax!

536
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,870
Slowly!

537
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,030
Slowly!

538
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,090
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

539
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,130
Wow!

540
00:35:48,160 --> 00:36:03,850
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

541
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:05,050
Put your legs down.

542
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,170
Wait, wait, wait.

543
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,520
Let's go.

544
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

545
00:36:39,425 --> 00:36:41,300
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

546
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,360
Did she go?

547
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,670
She went, didn't she?

548
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Didn't she go?

549
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Then,

550
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
I'll let you go.

551
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,340
Here.

552
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:15,230
I'm going to let you go.

553
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,710
I'm going to let you go.

554
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,650
If you don't go, I'll keep doing this.

555
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,210
You don't go?

556
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,530
Then, until you go,

557
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,630
I'll finish if you go.

558
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
It feels good.

559
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
It feels good.

560
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,100
You're round.

561
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,220
You're round.

562
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,381
You look like you're in pain.

563
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
I think she's biting.

564
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,700
What are you doing?

565
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,200
Yes, that's a good girl.

566
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,311
I think she was in a bad mood earlier.

567
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,600
I'll do it.

568
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,601
I'll do it.

569
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,010
Are you going?

570
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,210
I'm going.

571
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,330
You have to go.

572
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,850
I'm going.

573
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,570
Are you going?

574
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,260
Are you going?

575
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,261
You are so stubborn.

576
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,340
You are so stubborn.

577
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,900
You are so stubborn.

578
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,120
Oh, no.

579
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Don't cry.

580
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
Stand up.

581
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,530
You can see your feet.

582
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Can you see your feet?

583
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,870
Step on your feet.

584
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,270
What?

585
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,170
Are you a newborn baby?

586
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,670
No, I'm not.

587
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:46,090
Your husband is close to you.

588
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,740
You are a big girl.

589
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,100
Don't make a sound.

590
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,101
Go quietly.

591
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,481
You can go up to the front.

592
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,360
Don't make a face.

593
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,860
Don't make a sound.

594
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,261
If you make a sound, you'll be found out.

595
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
You'll wake up.

596
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,590
What are you going to do?

597
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,550
That's not good.

598
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,260
Chikkun, you can't do that.

599
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:39,930
He's gone.

600
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,310
He's gone.

601
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,330
He's gone.

602
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:37,080
You don't have to go.

603
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,420
Come on.

604
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,260
Come on, come on.

605
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,440
Come on, come on.

606
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,501
Chikurin, you're sweating so much.

607
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,760
Oh, it feels good.

608
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,260
I'm sorry.

609
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:04,220
I'm sorry.

610
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
I'm sorry.

611
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm sorry.

612
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm sorry.

613
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:10,560
I'm sorry.

614
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,620
I'm sorry.

616
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm sorry.

617
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:24,760
Ah!

618
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Ah!

619
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
I went.

620
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,020
That's right.

621
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,010
Did you go?

622
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,290
Yes.

623
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,130
Did you go?

624
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,290
Yes.

625
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,230
No!

626
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,070
No!

627
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,030
No!

628
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,630
Why?

629
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,530
You can't leave me!

630
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,910
No!

631
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,550
I can't take it anymore.

632
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,590
I can't take it anymore.

633
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,390
I can't take it anymore.

634
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,280
I can't take it anymore.

635
00:43:14,565 --> 00:43:15,360
Here you are.

636
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Take it.

637
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:26,630
I took it out.

638
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,450
It's clean.

639
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,850
It's clean.

640
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,530
It's clean.

641
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,730
It's clean.

642
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:43,731
You are so beautiful.

643
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,460
Here you are.

644
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,000
I'll give you a medicine.

645
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,410
You got out of the box.

646
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,360
You are so beautiful.

647
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,040
Here you are.

648
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,200
What's wrong?

649
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,660
Here you are.

650
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,680
Here you are.

651
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:06,620
I'm hurt.

652
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,640
It's hurt.

653
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:17,530
Are you alive?

654
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,870
She is in a critical condition.

655
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:40,120
She is stuck.

656
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,380
You guys are helpless.

657
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
What's wrong?

658
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,330
It's okay.

659
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:05,806
You two are out, so you can watch TV.

660
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,390
Why are there so many people?

661
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,230
What?

662
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,830
Are you going to wake them up?

663
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,510
I don't want to.

664
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,660
No one is coming.

665
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:20,970
I don't want to.

666
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,610
It's okay.

667
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:23,611
You feel better?

668
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:41,830
You don't want to do it.

669
00:46:48,540 --> 00:47:06,360
You're next to your husband.

670
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,870
You're going to get dizzy.

671
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,830
Look over there.

672
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:21,310
I'm going to give you a massage.

673
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,230
I'm going to give you a massage.

674
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:24,231
Are you comfortable?

675
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,820
Are you comfortable?

676
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:42,120
I'm going to give you a massage.

677
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,000
Soda-San, wait a minute.

678
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,860
You have a bad temper.

679
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:10,230
Please don't kill me.

680
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,510
I beg you.

681
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:14,870
I don't want money.

682
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,980
What?

683
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,060
Stop it.

684
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,500
What?

685
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,120
Stop it.

686
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,540
That's just an act.

687
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,530
Stop it.

688
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,430
Stop it.

689
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,690
Stop it.

690
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,110
Baby.

691
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,530
Baby.

692
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,810
Baby.

693
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,030
She's wearing a diaper.

694
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,870
She's coming out.

695
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,800
One more time.

696
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,750
One more time.

697
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,780
Good girl.

698
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,640
What?

699
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,641
What?

700
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,400
What's that?

701
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:12,760
You're a good girl, you know
that, don't you, Aoki-San?

702
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
You're a good girl.

703
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,320
Don't tell anyone.

704
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
You're a good girl.

705
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,660
Don't tell anyone.

706
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
You'll be exposed.

707
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,540
Let's drink again.

708
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,440
Let's drink.

709
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:29,441
Thank you, thank you.

710
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,400
Today's sake is good, isn't it?

711
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,060
I'm full.

712
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,660
I'm full.

713
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,750
What time is it now?

714
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,250
You scared me.

715
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,310
Where is the guest?

716
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,871
He went back to his room and took a rest.

717
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,020
I see.

718
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,560
You should go to bed now.

719
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,180
Yes.

720
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,860
Then I'll go to bed too.

721
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:03,160
I have to go to work early in the
morning tomorrow, so wake me up early.

722
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:06,600
Good night.

723
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,700
Good night.

724
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,220
Good morning, ma'am.

725
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,760
What's for breakfast today?

726
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,540
I haven't told anyone.

727
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,680
I don't have any money left.

728
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,590
I can't take it anymore.

729
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,300
Please.

730
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,700
You don't have to go through all this.

731
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,220
It's not that bad.

732
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,280
It's not that bad.

733
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,320
You've got 3,000,000 yen, right?

734
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,440
Do you want to do it again
until tomorrow morning?

735
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,220
Stop it.

736
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:09,970
I'm so sorry.

737
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,441
Just pretend to be normal.

738
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,151
You'll understand if I
talk to you strangely.

739
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,420
Yes, I understand.

740
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,950
Hello.

741
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,650
I saw a sign that said open.

742
00:54:34,715 --> 00:54:48,200
What's wrong?

743
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,140
A man...

744
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:53,780
A man is coming.

745
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:55,520
My husband is coming.

746
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,260
Please.

747
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,300
Please.

748
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,060
Please.

749
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:01,340
Please, please, please.

750
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,020
Oh, looks like you're doing well.

751
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,200
Come here, come here.

752
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:07,720
No, no, no.

753
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,780
Come here, come here.

754
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,820
No, no, no.

755
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,760
No, no, no.

756
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,380
These people, these people.

757
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,540
They're going to hurt me.

758
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,030
Let me see.

759
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:44,430
What?

760
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:45,670
Hey, ma'am.

761
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,190
What? Why?

762
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,930
No, no, no.

763
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:59,890
This guy, you know... He
betrayed us by letting his wife go.

764
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,790
What? Why?

765
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,270
Why?

766
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Calm down.

767
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,220
I was surprised when I talked to you.

768
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,100
The company is doing well.

769
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:15,980
You haven't been told anything.

770
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,140
You went bankrupt due to debt.

771
00:56:20,205 --> 00:56:22,880
You abandoned your family and employees.

772
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:25,580
What's wrong with you, the
president of the company?

773
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:34,400
Because... All he said was
that the company is doing well.

774
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,300
I'm an ex-employee who used to work there.

775
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:46,560
He's a bastard who threw
everything away and ran away.

776
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,020
No way...

777
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,390
It's so bad...

778
00:56:58,595 --> 00:57:01,670
That's right, that's
right... I know... Stop!

779
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,010
Stop!

780
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:22,460
I want to see it!

781
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,640
Now...

782
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,560
How's your abalone today?

783
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,480
Is it better than yesterday?

784
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,540
You're acting like you're in pain.

785
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,740
I'm in pain.

786
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
I'm in pain.

787
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:25,780
I'm in pain.

788
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,540
Who would come to this kind of place?

789
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,080
I'm in pain.

790
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,560
I'm in pain.

791
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:52,940
I'm in pain.

792
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:55,760
What's this?

793
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,361
She's scared and getting scared.

794
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,300
Oh, no.

795
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,160
We can't do anything about it.

796
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:04,240
She's been running around for 5 years.

797
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,600
She's got a headache.

798
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,920
You're not going to get any better.

799
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,980
Look at her.

800
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:19,590
She's fast.

801
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,420
She's talking to me.

802
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:27,421
It's cold!

803
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:32,410
You're in shock, aren't you?

804
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,650
Oh, no!

805
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:37,790
Oh, no!

806
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,150
Oh, no!

807
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
You hid your underwear!

808
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,870
Pon-chan's Polaroid camera hid it.

809
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,530
You have a beautiful body.

810
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,490
I'm sorry.

811
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:56,630
I know.

812
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,150
Let's give up.

813
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,190
Here.

814
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,170
Dirty.

815
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,310
No!

816
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,510
I'll put it in the morning.

817
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:09,890
Let me go.

818
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,270
More.

819
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,190
Is it better to wet it?

820
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:15,330
Yes.

821
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,010
How can I wet more?

822
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,690
No!

823
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:33,030
Let me go.

824
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,620
It's so cute.

825
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,560
You're so beautiful.

826
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
You're so beautiful.

827
01:01:22,940 --> 01:02:03,990
You're so beautiful You're so beautiful
So pretty It's so cold You look so pretty.

828
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,490
Stand up.

829
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,370
Show me.

830
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,850
Stand up.

831
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:43,760
Be honest.

832
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,910
I'll do something pleasant for you.

833
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,710
No!

834
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,360
Stand up.

835
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,220
No!

836
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,520
Stop it!

837
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,300
I'll do something pleasant for you.

838
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,230
She is crying.

839
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:47,570
She is very lively.

840
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:51,550
She is more lively than yesterday.

841
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,090
Because she is a raw abalone.

842
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,750
Because she is a living creature.

843
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,670
I'll give her a lot of water.

844
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:12,110
You're so strong.

845
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,820
I promise you that.

846
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,220
Smile.

847
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,800
You're bleeding.

848
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:32,260
You're bleeding.

849
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,160
It must have been disgusting.

850
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,040
Don't cry.

851
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,840
Ok, let's go.

852
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,120
I prepared a bed for you.

853
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,560
Come here.

854
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Ok, Rami.

855
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
Good.

856
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,060
Ok, let's start.

857
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,570
Ok, Rami.

858
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,280
You are such a good boy.

859
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,180
Ok, Rami.

860
01:06:05,181 --> 01:06:07,180
Come on.

861
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,760
Come on.

862
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,400
Come on.

863
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,920
First, let's go to the back of the throat.

864
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:29,841
Let's go all the way to
the back of your throat.

865
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:35,160
It's best to go all the way to the
back of your throat in the morning.

866
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,900
More, more.

867
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,900
Here, here, here.

868
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:44,460
Here, here, here.

869
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,080
Sit down.

870
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,220
Sit down.

871
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:22,340
Hold her tight.

872
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,860
Give her a warm welcome.

873
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:45,490
Don't let go of it.

874
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,201
I'll do it with just my mouth.

875
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,940
That's a good voice.

876
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,600
That's a good voice.

877
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,300
It's not over yet.

878
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It's not over yet.

879
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,720
Give me your hand.

880
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,480
Come on, come on.

881
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,860
Come on.

882
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:26,780
You're surrounded by so many things.

883
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,140
It's disgusting.

884
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,300
Come on, come on.

885
01:08:42,945 --> 01:08:43,720
You're becoming more and more quiet.

886
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:44,721
You've become so big.

887
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:45,960
Yes, yes, yes.

888
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,270
You've got a lot of fat.

889
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
Here you are.

890
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,780
You're so big.

891
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:54,300
Oh, yes.

892
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,420
You're getting bigger.

893
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:58,920
You're breathing heavily.

894
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,340
Yes.

895
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,700
Good.

896
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,040
You're so big.

897
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,380
You're so big.

898
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,130
Wow!

899
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,260
You're not going to do it?

900
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,380
Do it properly.

901
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,180
You have to do it properly.

902
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:21,181
You have to get up.

903
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,880
Open your legs wider.

904
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,020
I'm scared!

905
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,960
Come here.

906
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,060
I'll give you a sock.

907
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:07,061
I'm sorry.

908
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,100
I'm sorry.

909
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,380
Good girl.

910
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:40,860
You three are customers.

911
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,490
I'm sorry.

912
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,880
I'm sorry.

913
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:57,360
Is it still warm?

914
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,880
How do you feel?

915
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,320
It's a mess.

916
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,400
It's almost ready.

917
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,080
Here it comes.

918
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,300
Are you going to die?

919
01:11:22,301 --> 01:11:23,301
Are you OK?

920
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,900
Are you alive?

921
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:31,400
You look like a skeleton.

922
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,300
Are you OK?

923
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,000
Did you lose weight?

924
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,001
Did you get it?

925
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:47,920
Here you go.

926
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,340
Don't put it in your butt.

927
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,680
Don't put it in your butt.

928
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,400
Here you go.

929
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,140
Oh, it's melting.

930
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,420
It's melting.

931
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:22,065
You've grown up.

932
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,440
You've grown up.

933
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,000
You've grown up.

934
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,400
It's in your mouth.

935
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,540
Stop it!

936
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:39,860
Why?

937
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,040
I don't want to!

938
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:54,630
Ouch!

939
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,110
Oh, you ate the help.

940
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,210
Let's give you a foot massage.

941
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:25,730
I won't let you rest, wife.

942
01:13:31,190 --> 01:14:09,320
I won't help you.

943
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,170
Show me your face.

944
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,600
I can't move my mouth.

945
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,840
You don't have much energy left, do you?

946
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,466
You don't have much energy left, do you?

947
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:30,530
You've been put in a cage.

948
01:15:30,905 --> 01:15:33,440
You don't have much energy left, do you?

949
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:45,710
You're crying.

950
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,190
Come on.

951
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,680
Come on.

952
01:15:53,030 --> 01:16:02,100
You're a good girl.

953
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,480
You're a good girl.

954
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,920
Get on my back.

955
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,360
You're on my back.

956
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,060
Come on.

957
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:10,956
Kokichi, you have to
hold on a little longer.

958
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,180
Hang in there for another day.

959
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:15,660
You can do it.

960
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:16,661
Give her a hand.

961
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,620
It's been a while, hasn't it?

962
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,840
It's been a while, hasn't it?

963
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,200
Matsuzaki!

964
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,870
What are you doing?

965
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,210
Ema, what are you doing?

966
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:16,510
So you're going to take care
of the employees who quit?

967
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:20,590
Will you kill me?
Will you give me back my dead wife?

968
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:25,310
Look at me.

969
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,130
Do you know what she looks like now?

970
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:31,850
Tell me.

971
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:34,090
She looks sad.

972
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,170
Why?

973
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,760
She looks sad.

974
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:43,761
What are you doing?

975
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,680
I'm going to kill you.

976
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,710
Don't do that.

977
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,740
It's meaningless.

978
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:51,530
Wait.

979
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,240
Look at me.

980
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,080
Look at me.

981
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,020
Look at me.

982
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:23,780
I'm going to kill you.

983
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,060
Don't do that.

984
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,180
But my wife is dead.

985
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,140
I don't care.

986
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,580
Oh oh oh.

987
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:42,360
So can I get out?

988
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,801
No no no Stop?

989
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:50,000
No Alright, I'm getting out.

990
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,070
Here.

991
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,590
Here you go

992
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:59,030
She's holding her head up.

993
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:02,930
Here.

994
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,410
Oh.

995
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:15,440
Oh oh oh Do you want it, Seishi?

996
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,200
Ouch!

997
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:17,910
What's that?

998
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,400
Show it to me.

999
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:41,610
Hey, hey, hey.

1000
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,410
Stand up.

1001
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:44,850
Hey, hey, hey.

1002
01:19:44,851 --> 01:19:45,010
Stand up, stand up.

1003
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,310
Put your hands on your head.

1004
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:47,311
Hey, hey, hey.

1005
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,350
Stand up.

1006
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,690
You have to look at your wife.

1007
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,010
Hey.

1008
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,050
Hey, wife.

1009
01:19:54,230 --> 01:20:02,020
What are you looking at?

1010
01:20:02,021 --> 01:20:03,021
Look at your face.

1011
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,240
Look at your wife.

1012
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,540
Look at your face.

1013
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,280
You too.

1014
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,780
Look at your wife.

1015
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,320
You're a woman.

1016
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,500
You're a woman.

1017
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:20,260
You're a woman.

1018
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,660
Say the truth.

1019
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,640
Say the truth to your wife.

1020
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,020
Say you're sorry you lied.

1021
01:20:29,021 --> 01:20:29,560
Come on, say it.

1022
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:30,940
I was angry.

1023
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,360
Come on, say it.

1024
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:34,980
I'm sorry.

1025
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
I'm sorry.

1026
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,471
You stole the company, didn't you?

1027
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,110
I was angry.

1028
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,680
Say it with your own mouth.

1029
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
Say it.

1030
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,840
Say it!

1031
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,321
I'm telling you to say it!

1032
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:56,510
I'm sorry.

1033
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,310
I can't hear you.

1034
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:01,310
I'm sorry.

1035
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:02,930
Here you are.

1036
01:21:03,005 --> 01:21:04,490
I'll give it back to you.

1037
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,990
I'll crush you.

1038
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:10,490
I'm used to it.

1039
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,840
Here you are.

1040
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,360
Do you want to have a drink?

1041
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,140
I'll buy it for you.

1042
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,940
I'll wait for you.

1043
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:32,920
Here you are.

1044
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,540
Don't lie to me.

1045
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,020
I'll punish you.

1046
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:47,580
Let me kiss you.

1047
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,540
Don't look at me.

1048
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,540
You can do it!

1049
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,140
You can do it!

1050
01:21:59,885 --> 01:22:01,340
You can do it!

1051
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,900
You can do it!

1052
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:07,960
You can do it!

1053
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,020
You can do it!

1054
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:15,620
You can do it!

1055
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,840
You can do it!

1056
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:18,660
You can do it!

1057
01:22:18,661 --> 01:22:18,740
You can do it!

1058
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:20,740
I'm sorry.

1059
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,680
They're out.

1060
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,200
Damn it.

1061
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,460
That's enough.

1062
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,100
Come on, let's hug.

1063
01:22:33,145 --> 01:22:44,400
Hey, come on.

1064
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:46,560
You should have seen it.

1065
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,561
You should have seen it.

1066
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,080
You should apologize.

1067
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,780
You shouldn't have.

1068
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,720
I'm sorry.

1069
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:55,200
I'm sorry.

1070
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,080
You should have been a bigger girl.

1071
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,620
I'm sorry.

1072
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,810
What's going on?

1073
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,870
You're starting to cry.

1074
01:23:17,835 --> 01:23:22,030
You should take care of your husband.

1075
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:23,110
Haru-chan, look at him.

1076
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:25,710
You should look at each other.

1077
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,840
You are getting along with him.

1078
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:40,300
He is going away.

1079
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,200
He went away.

1080
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:04,480
I'm sorry.

1081
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,100
Don't say sorry.

1082
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:09,480
My dead wife won't come back.

1083
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,120
She'll be upset.

1084
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,140
Your wife will come back.

1085
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,200
What's wrong?

1086
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:33,220
I'm sorry to make you feel bad.

1087
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:35,180
I'm sorry.

1088
01:24:35,181 --> 01:24:36,540
No, I don't.

1089
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,260
Look at her.

1090
01:24:46,785 --> 01:24:54,160
Look at her.

1091
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,850
What's that?

1092
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:19,400
Are you going to show her?

1093
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:28,590
I'm sorry.

1094
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:33,570
He's just a normal guy.

1095
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,670
You don't have any grudge against him.

1096
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,311
But you made a mistake in your marriage.

1097
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:41,411
You made a mistake in your life.

1098
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:43,330
That's a sin.

1099
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,790
But if you feel so good
because of this sex,

1100
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,120
at least you're saved.

1101
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,010
I'm sorry.

1102
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:01,150
Come on, ma'am.

1103
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,790
You're all scared, aren't you?

1104
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:08,290
Let's forget all the
bad things with a kiss.

1105
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,440
Open your legs.

1106
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:58,330
I'm glad to hear that.

1107
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,030
But it's your fault for arresting that man.

1108
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,340
How was it, Osamu?

1109
01:27:14,165 --> 01:27:15,800
It was a good job. Thank you.

1110
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,160
I'll pay you back.

1111
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,360
Of course.

1112
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:24,380
But...

1113
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,560
It's still good, isn't it?

1114
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:28,561
I'm sorry.

1115
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,460
It can't be helped.

1116
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,740
I'm sorry.

1117
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,210
How long has it been since then?

1118
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:59,250
The sun has set, and I don't
know if this is a dream or reality.

1119
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:06,670
Even so, the men continued
to eat away at my body.

1120
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:11,450
Do you want to go?

1121
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:22,700
Isn't it a little early?

1122
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,200
Let's go to the broth.

1123
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:29,260
I'm sorry.

1124
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,680
I'm sorry.

1125
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,240
What?

1126
01:28:52,205 --> 01:28:53,640
The first round has just begun.

1127
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,880
I'm sorry.

1128
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:01,960
I'm sorry.

1129
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:03,580
I can't do it anymore.

1130
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:18,790
It hurts.

1131
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:51,080
I can't do it anymore.

1132
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:10,330
Don't be so violent.

1133
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,310
This is a theme park.

1134
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,730
You did a good job.

1135
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,430
Hey, look at me.

1136
01:30:42,431 --> 01:30:43,431
I told you to go away.

1137
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:49,700
My wife.

1138
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,880
Do you feel good?

1139
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,980
If you want to pee more,

1140
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,820
you have to change your clothes.

1141
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,000
I don't feel good.

1142
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,320
You have to change your clothes.

1143
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,380
What do you want to pee?

1144
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,160
I want to pee.

1145
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,780
You have to change your clothes.

1146
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:16,900
Really?

1147
01:31:16,901 --> 01:31:17,901
I'm sorry.

1148
01:31:18,045 --> 01:31:19,900
I'll give you a hand.

1149
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:35,010
Move your brother.

1150
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:51,490
Are you looking at me?

1151
01:31:51,491 --> 01:31:52,491
Do you want to do it?

1152
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,520
If you want to do it, you can do it.

1153
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,740
How do you feel?

1154
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,720
I feel good.

1155
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,680
Say something
like, Can I do it, too?

1156
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,640
What do you think?

1157
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,040
Can I do it?

1158
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,140
Here you are.

1159
01:32:38,155 --> 01:32:39,480
Oh, you got a big one.

1160
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:58,880
There's a lot of toys over there.

1161
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,620
There's a lot of toys over there.

1162
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,040
It's good, isn't it?

1163
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,960
This toy looks good.

1164
01:33:12,935 --> 01:33:23,040
It's good, isn't it?

1165
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:37,530
Eat more.

1166
01:33:37,531 --> 01:33:38,531
Don't eat so much.

1167
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,780
I think it's better to eat
the real thing than this.

1168
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,740
I'll break this one, too.

1169
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,320
I'll break that one, too.

1170
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,460
Your husband is looking
at you with a great face.

1171
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:22,200
What are you looking at?

1172
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:26,740
You're still eating.

1173
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,060
It's delicious.

1174
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,920
I'll give you more.

1175
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,560
I'll give you more.

1176
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:37,100
Put it on your face.

1177
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:39,920
Put it on your face.

1178
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:41,980
Put it on your face.

1179
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:43,360
Rub it on your face.

1180
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,340
Rub it on your face.

1181
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:50,640
It feels good.

1182
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:01,120
You have to drink it all.

1183
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,320
You have to drink it all.

1184
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,800
Drink it all.

1185
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,440
You are standing up.

1186
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,420
What are you going to do?

1187
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,940
Here, if you want to
lick the doggy, move it.

1188
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:35,980
Please lick it.

1189
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,760
Please lick it.

1190
01:35:38,345 --> 01:35:39,345
Please lick it.

1191
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,080
Please lick it.

1192
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:43,460
Open your mouth and lick it.

1193
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:44,860
This is...

1194
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh!

1195
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,450
Oh, good!

1196
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:26,970
Good!

1197
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:28,330
Let's wash your hands and mouth.

1198
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:36,490
Yes, yes.

1199
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:37,590
Let's wash your face, too.

1200
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:41,640
Let's wash your face.

1201
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:10,270
I'm sorry.

1202
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,040
I'll put my butt out.

1203
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,780
You have a good butt.

1204
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:50,890
How do you feel?

1205
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:53,650
How do you feel?

1206
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,130
Are you fine?

1207
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:15,910
I'm fine.

1208
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:26,020
How about glible Man-ko?

1209
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,520
She's still sucking on the لound.

1210
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,500
Put it in your mouth.

1211
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,540
I'll do it myself.

1212
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,060
Here it comes.

1213
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,560
Try moving it.

1214
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,360
Move it yourself.

1215
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,720
You like this, don't you?

1216
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:47,300
I'll make you feel better,
so move it yourself.

1217
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:51,860
You feel better than
your husband, don't you?

1218
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:53,020
I'm scared.

1219
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,660
What?

1220
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,420
You just said you felt good.

1221
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,200
You said you felt good.

1222
01:40:17,485 --> 01:40:24,260
I'm scared.

1223
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,280
I'm scared.

1224
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:27,740
I'm scared.

1225
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:28,980
I'm scared.

1226
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:40,680
I'm scared.

1227
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:49,730
Ah...

1228
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,240
Ah, I feel sick.

1229
01:40:58,540 --> 01:40:58,680
I can't breathe.

1230
01:40:58,681 --> 01:41:00,480
Oh... I feel sick...

1231
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,940
Ah... I feel sick...
Ah... I feel sick...

1232
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:32,651
I feel sick... Oh!

1233
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:36,640
Oh!

1234
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,900
You broke it.

1235
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:40,780
Here you are.

1236
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,980
Hold it.

1237
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,240
Here you are.

1238
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,960
Open your legs.

1239
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:52,660
Open your legs.

1240
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:54,280
Put your hands behind your head.

1241
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:56,340
Here we go.

1242
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,120
Here we go.

1243
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:03,040
Here you are.

1244
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:03,320
Here you are.

1245
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,940
You can do it.

1246
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,300
You can do it.

1247
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,560
You can do it.

1248
01:42:08,925 --> 01:42:19,700
It's so comfortable.

1249
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,700
Go.

1250
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,000
Put your hands behind your back.

1251
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:42,900
You can do it.

1252
01:42:43,065 --> 01:42:44,880
You can do it.

1253
01:42:44,881 --> 01:42:45,881
You can do it.

1254
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:47,820
I'm sorry.

1255
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:49,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1256
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:51,220
Oh, it feels good.

1257
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,740
Let's go. Let's go.

1258
01:42:53,315 --> 01:42:54,356
Go to your husband's room.

1259
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:55,840
I'm sorry.

1260
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:20,030
Where are you going?

1261
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,110
Are you okay?

1262
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,620
Oh, it feels good.

1263
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:33,120
I'll watch you.

1264
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,000
That's it.

1265
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:57,120
That's it.

1266
01:43:57,121 --> 01:43:58,121
Tighten it properly.

1267
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:11,260
It's too loose.

1268
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,570
It's broken.

1269
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:04,700
It's in.

1270
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,120
It's in.

1271
01:45:07,121 --> 01:45:08,200
I'm so happy!

1272
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:39,980
What's wrong?

1273
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:42,480
You want more, don't you?

1274
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,560
I'm so hungry.

1275
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:47,580
You're hungry?

1276
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,480
You're eating a lot.

1277
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,141
It's dark even if you look this way.

1278
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:38,750
It's dark.

1279
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:24,630
I don't feel good at all.

1280
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:26,750
I want money.

1281
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:28,850
Please give me money.

1282
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:32,860
I'll put it on your back.

1283
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,420
I want to see your whole body.

1284
01:47:37,421 --> 01:47:37,600
It hurts.

1285
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:39,340
You can do it.

1286
01:47:41,425 --> 01:47:43,660
You can do it.

1287
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:48,180
You can do it.

1288
01:47:48,880 --> 01:48:01,730
It's long.

1289
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:07,110
You are tired.

1290
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:09,470
You can do it.

1291
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:10,490
It's over.

1292
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,030
You can do it.

1293
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:18,450
OK!

1294
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:23,470
I'm sorry.

1295
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:40,210
You are very strong.

1296
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:45,690
I give you an egg.

1297
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:50,590
You are cute.

1298
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:00,540
You can do it.

1299
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:01,700
You can do it.

1300
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,270
You can do it.

1301
01:49:58,271 --> 01:49:59,271
You can do it.

1302
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:13,690
Does it feel good?

1303
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,520
It feels good.

1304
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:20,870
Do you want it?

1305
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,090
Yes, I do.

1306
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:23,930
Let me go inside.

1307
01:50:24,330 --> 01:50:25,330
Please.

1308
01:50:34,745 --> 01:50:36,330
What are you going to do?

1309
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:37,810
Please.

1310
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:41,440
Let me go inside.

1311
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:42,000
Take it.

1312
01:50:42,001 --> 01:50:43,001
Inside!

1313
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:08,290
Here we go.

1314
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:23,600
Here we go.

1315
01:51:23,601 --> 01:51:25,400
Move, move.

1316
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,320
Go deeper.

1317
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:56,730
Go deeper.

1318
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:10,740
Let go.

1319
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,900
Let me go.

1320
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:39,570
Let me go.

1321
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,080
Let me go.

1322
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:18,260
How do you feel?

1323
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:26,640
Come on, come on.

1324
01:53:26,641 --> 01:53:26,740
Come here.

1325
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,340
Hey, hey, hey.

1326
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:32,660
Hey, come here.

1327
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:40,560
Your wife's manko is
open, and the manko is here.

1328
01:53:41,770 --> 01:53:43,820
Hey, hey, show me. Where is it?

1329
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:48,140
Mr. Matsuzaki, my wife's manko is here.

1330
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:55,700
Masuzuki-San, your wife Mac is here.

1331
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,440
Here?

1332
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,760
Where?

1333
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:04,220
Where?

1334
01:54:05,370 --> 01:54:07,960
Your wife Mac is here.

1335
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:08,840
Where?

1336
01:54:08,841 --> 01:54:10,280
Let me see your right arm.

1337
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:20,260
You did a good job.

1338
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,100
I'm so sorry.

1339
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,660
I'm surprised, too.

1340
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,900
You look like a newborn baby.

1341
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,220
My belly is getting bigger!

1342
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:42,900
Your belly is getting smaller!

1343
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:44,320
Your belly is getting smaller!

1344
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:45,680
I'm moving!

1345
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,100
I feel good!

1346
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:50,700
You feel good!

1347
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,120
I'm sorry!

1348
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:55,940
I feel good!

1349
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,180
Which one is better?

1350
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,600
Your husband's or mine?

1351
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,220
This one is better!

1352
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:10,030
I feel good!

1353
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:10,870
It's disgusting!

1354
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:12,830
Let go! Let go! Let go!

1355
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:14,490
Here we go!

1356
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,630
Wow!

1357
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:17,590
You scared me!

1358
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:19,850
Let go, darling!

1359
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:21,690
It's disgusting!

1360
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:23,210
It's disgusting!

1361
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:27,190
I'm going to throw up!

1362
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:28,790
I'm going to throw up!

1363
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:41,160
You're so slow!

1364
01:55:41,161 --> 01:55:42,600
Don't look at me.

1365
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:49,520
I'm going to kill you.

1366
01:55:52,100 --> 01:56:00,060
Don't look at me.

1367
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,680
I'm going to kill you.

1368
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:35,540
I'm going to kill you.

1369
01:56:35,541 --> 01:56:36,720
It's coming out.

1370
01:56:36,721 --> 01:56:37,721
I'm sorry.

1371
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:39,140
I'm sorry.

1372
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,280
It's coming out.

1373
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:04,130
It's coming out.

1374
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:15,920
It's coming out.

1375
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:22,030
Are you still licking me?

1376
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:23,390
Are you still licking me?
