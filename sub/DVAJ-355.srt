1
3.76 --> 4.76
 It looks delicious.

2
4.76 --> 6.76
 Eppon, hurry up.

3
6.76 --> 7.76
 Bring it to me.

4
7.76 --> 8.76
 Take it.

5
8.76 --> 10.76
 It's a little hard.

6
10.76 --> 12.76
 Please listen to me.

7
15.76 --> 16.76
 Here you are.

8
16.76 --> 18.76
 I don't like carrots.

9
18.76 --> 19.76
 Just eat it.

10
19.76 --> 20.76
 I don't like meat.

11
20.76 --> 22.76
 Why are you doing that?

12
22.76 --> 23.76
 It's not good for your health.

13
23.76 --> 24.76
 Eppon.

14
24.76 --> 25.76
 What?

15
26.76 --> 27.76
 One piece of dried yakiniku.

16
27.76 --> 29.76
 One piece of dried yakiniku.

17
29.76 --> 30.76
 Bye-bye.

18
30.76 --> 33.76
 I've never eaten this meat.

19
34.76 --> 36.76
 It's not good for your health.

20
37.76 --> 38.76
 This is the limit.

21
38.76 --> 39.76
 What?

22
39.76 --> 40.76
 What?

23
40.76 --> 42.76
 Why are you doing that?

24
42.76 --> 43.76
 Can I help you?

25
43.76 --> 44.76
 No.

26
44.76 --> 45.76
 I can't help you.

27
45.76 --> 46.76
 I'm talking to you.

28
46.76 --> 47.76
 Can I help you?

29
47.76 --> 48.76
 Yes.

30
48.76 --> 49.76
 Yamada, are you eating meat?

31
49.76 --> 50.76
 Yes, I am.

32
50.76 --> 51.76
 You are not.

33
52.76 --> 53.76
 I asked if you were eating.

34
53.76 --> 55.76
 I'm eating.

35
55.76 --> 56.76
 Are you eating, too?

36
57.76 --> 58.76
 I'm going to eat.

37
61.76 --> 62.76
 I'm hungry.

38
63.76 --> 64.76
 It looks delicious.

39
64.76 --> 65.76
 I'm going to eat.

40
65.76 --> 66.76
 What's this?

41
67.76 --> 68.76
 I've never seen this meat.

42
68.76 --> 70.76
 Yes, I've never seen this meat.

43
70.76 --> 71.76
 Itadakimasu.

44
71.76 --> 73.76
 I bought it at a restaurant I've never heard of.

45
73.76 --> 74.76
 You're right.

46
76.76 --> 78.76
 Why are they connected?

47
79.76 --> 80.76
 Eppon is...

48
81.76 --> 82.76
 What?

49
82.76 --> 83.76
 What?

50
83.76 --> 84.76
 What?

51
84.76 --> 85.76
 What?

52
87.76 --> 88.76
 What?

53
88.76 --> 89.76
 What?

54
89.76 --> 90.76
 It's like a baby food.

55
94.76 --> 96.76
 Yui doesn't eat baby food.

56
97.76 --> 99.76
 I wanted to eat it.

57
102.76 --> 103.76
 You're cute.

58
105.76 --> 106.76
 I'm lonely.

59
108.76 --> 109.76
 You're cute.

60
110.76 --> 111.76
 Yeah.

61
113.76 --> 114.76
 It's not a play.

62
115.76 --> 116.76
 You're cute.

63
118.76 --> 119.76
 We're getting married.

64
121.76 --> 122.76
 It's not a play.

65
123.76 --> 124.76
 It's not you.

66
126.76 --> 129.76
 It's not you.

67
129.76 --> 130.76
 She thinks it's her personality.

68
130.76 --> 132.76
 I don't think the marriage battle will be over.

69
134.76 --> 135.76
 I have a rough stomach.

70
135.76 --> 136.76
 Shut up.

71
137.76 --> 138.76
 Oh, no.

72
139.76 --> 140.76
 Get away from me.

73
141.76 --> 142.76
 I can't hold it anymore.

74
142.76 --> 143.76
 Yui is sleepy.

75
173.76 --> 175.76
 You look sleepy

76
175.76 --> 176.90
 You are sleepy

77
176.90 --> 178.90
 But you are not going home today

78
178.90 --> 180.40
 What?

79
180.40 --> 182.40
 I will count the days from tomorrow

80
182.40 --> 184.40
 No, no, no, not that

81
184.40 --> 226.94
 I am sleepy

82
226.94 --> 228.94
 So you are not coming tomorrow

83
228.94 --> 255.55
 I am sleepy

84
255.55 --> 257.55
 I am going to sleep here again

85
257.55 --> 259.55
 What?

86
259.55 --> 261.55
 Are you going to sleep?

87
261.55 --> 267.42
 Yes, I am going to sleep

88
267.42 --> 269.42
 Don't wake up if you go out

89
269.42 --> 271.42
 Hey

90
272.06 --> 274.06
 Stop it

91
274.06 --> 280.00
 Hey

92
280.00 --> 282.00
 Are you going to sleep?

93
282.00 --> 286.91
 I am scared

94
286.91 --> 391.28
 I am not sleepy

95
393.28 --> 395.28
 Muka-chan

96
395.28 --> 397.28
 I washed the dishes

97
397.28 --> 399.28
 Thank you

98
399.28 --> 401.28
 There is one left

99
401.28 --> 403.28
 It's okay

100
403.28 --> 405.28
 Let's go

101
405.92 --> 407.92
 Let's go

102
407.92 --> 409.92
 Muka-chan, are you ready?

103
409.92 --> 411.92
 Yes

104
411.92 --> 413.92
 I don't need souvenirs

105
413.92 --> 415.92
 I don't need to worry

106
415.92 --> 417.92
 You don't need to worry

107
417.92 --> 419.92
 It's okay

108
419.92 --> 421.92
 I don't need to worry

109
421.92 --> 423.92
 See you

110
423.92 --> 425.92
 See you

111
425.92 --> 434.67
 I am going too

112
434.67 --> 438.11
 Where?

113
438.11 --> 440.11
 I told you

114
440.11 --> 442.11
 I am going on a trip with my family

115
442.75 --> 446.06
 I see

116
446.06 --> 448.06
 I am going to sleep

117
448.06 --> 450.06
 I am going to sleep

118
450.06 --> 464.64
 Wait

119
464.64 --> 466.64
 Did everyone go home?

120
466.64 --> 472.06
 Yes

121
472.06 --> 488.18
 Let's go

122
488.18 --> 490.18
 What are you doing?

123
501.62 --> 503.62
 What?

124
503.62 --> 505.62
 It's scary

125
507.62 --> 511.25
 What?

126
511.25 --> 541.92
 Why are you following me?

127
542.56 --> 548.94
 What are you doing?

128
548.94 --> 550.94
 I don't know

129
550.94 --> 552.94
 Are you playing with me?

130
552.94 --> 554.94
 Let's play

131
554.94 --> 556.94
 It's open

132
556.94 --> 558.94
 No

133
558.94 --> 564.56
 It's boring

134
564.56 --> 566.56
 What?

135
566.56 --> 568.56
 Are you playing with me?

136
568.56 --> 570.56
 It's embarrassing

137
577.46 --> 592.80
 Let's go

138
592.80 --> 594.80
 What?

139
594.80 --> 615.39
 Are you still filming?

140
616.03 --> 666.03
 What?

141
666.03 --> 739.10
 I am going to sleep

142
884.59 --> 988.64
 What?

143
988.64 --> 990.64
 Why?

144
990.64 --> 992.64
 It's too bright

145
1002.30 --> 1004.30
 It's too bright

146
1004.30 --> 1006.30
 I don't like it

147
1006.30 --> 1012.75
 It's embarrassing

148
1013.39 --> 1015.39
 I am going to sleep

149
1019.39 --> 1021.39
 I don't like it

150
1072.45 --> 1080.82
 It's embarrassing

151
1122.40 --> 1124.40
 It's embarrassing

152
1126.40 --> 1128.40
 What?

153
1168.69 --> 1212.29
 What is this?

154
1227.76 --> 1229.76
 It's too bright

155
1231.76 --> 1238.53
 Wait

156
1245.42 --> 1247.42
 Are you taking a shower?

157
1247.42 --> 1336.46
 No

158
1336.46 --> 1351.94
 It's embarrassing

159
1352.58 --> 1354.58
 It's embarrassing

160
1417.82 --> 1419.82
 What?

161
1419.82 --> 1426.21
 Do you want to sleep?

162
1743.66 --> 1745.66
 What?

163
1745.66 --> 1747.66
 It's too bright

164
1749.66 --> 1753.49
 Isn't it too bright?

165
1773.97 --> 1775.97
 It's embarrassing

166
1807.63 --> 1809.63
 What?

167
1811.63 --> 1813.63
 I am weak

168
1813.63 --> 1823.22
 No

169
1825.22 --> 1827.22
 No

170
1840.90 --> 1844.98
 It's embarrassing

171
1848.98 --> 1854.59
 I can't take it off

172
1856.59 --> 1858.59
 It's on

173
1858.59 --> 1860.59
 Wait

174
1860.59 --> 1862.59
 It's a tissue

175
1868.86 --> 1870.86
 I am going to take it off

176
1874.56 --> 1878.51
 Did you take it off?

177
1878.51 --> 1880.51
 Yes

178
1881.15 --> 1883.15
 It comes out

179
1883.15 --> 1885.15
 It's a different one

180
1885.15 --> 1887.15
 What?

181
1891.49 --> 1893.49
 It's dirty

182
1893.49 --> 1899.68
 What?

183
1917.95 --> 1919.95
 I don't like it

184
1919.95 --> 1921.95
 Don't touch it

185
1921.95 --> 1923.95
 Touch it later

186
1923.95 --> 1925.95
 I don't like it

187
1925.95 --> 1931.38
 Please

188
1931.38 --> 1933.38
 What are you doing?

189
1946.22 --> 1973.95
 What?

190
1975.95 --> 1977.95
 You are strong

191
1977.95 --> 1979.95
 What?

192
1979.95 --> 1981.95
 You are strong

193
1981.95 --> 1983.95
 Who?

194
1983.95 --> 1985.95
 You

195
1987.95 --> 1989.95
 I don't know

196
1991.95 --> 2014.78
 Maybe

197
2048.05 --> 2050.05
 What?

198
2050.05 --> 2055.73
 What are you laughing?

199
2056.37 --> 2060.77
 What?

200
2060.77 --> 2062.77
 What are you holding?

201
2062.77 --> 2066.66
 I don't know

202
2066.66 --> 2068.66
 A photo?

203
2068.66 --> 2070.66
 Yes

204
2070.66 --> 2072.66
 Don't you take a pose?

205
2076.66 --> 2078.66
 What are you taking?

206
2078.66 --> 2080.66
 Nothing

207
2080.66 --> 2088.90
 Why?

208
2088.90 --> 2090.90
 It's embarrassing

209
2090.90 --> 2092.90
 Is it a movie?

210
2092.90 --> 2094.90
 I don't know

211
2095.54 --> 2097.54
 It's a movie

212
2097.54 --> 2099.54
 I don't like it

213
2111.26 --> 2113.26
 What are you taking?

214
2113.26 --> 2115.26
 Kiss

215
2117.26 --> 2119.26
 It's a souvenir

216
2123.26 --> 2125.26
 I don't like it

217
2125.26 --> 2127.26
 My face

218
2127.26 --> 2129.26
 I don't like it

219
2131.26 --> 2133.26
 Please cut my face

220
2138.18 --> 2141.87
 Let's go sightseeing

221
2175.02 --> 2177.02
 You are a pervert

222
2177.02 --> 2179.02
 Were you a pervert?

223
2179.02 --> 2183.10
 I'm not

224
2212.61 --> 2233.07
 I peed on you

225
2233.07 --> 2235.07
 What?

226
2235.07 --> 2240.18
 Get up

227
2240.18 --> 2244.26
 Can I?

228
2244.26 --> 2251.86
 Where is a rubber band?

229
2251.86 --> 2253.86
 I have

230
2254.50 --> 2256.50
 Shut up

231
2256.50 --> 2258.50
 You are a pervert

232
2260.50 --> 2262.50
 I've never put it on

233
2262.50 --> 2264.50
 How do you do it?

234
2264.50 --> 2266.50
 Challenge

235
2266.50 --> 2268.50
 Which one?

236
2270.50 --> 2272.50
 Are you a girl?

237
2272.50 --> 2274.50
 I did it

238
2274.50 --> 2276.50
 Which one?

239
2278.50 --> 2280.50
 I just breathe

240
2280.50 --> 2282.50
 What?

241
2283.14 --> 2285.14
 Which one?

242
2287.14 --> 2289.14
 Is it right?

243
2289.14 --> 2295.52
 Does it hurt?

244
2295.52 --> 2297.52
 No

245
2297.52 --> 2305.06
 It's difficult

246
2305.06 --> 2307.06
 It's big

247
2307.06 --> 2309.06
 Why do you hit it?

248
2309.06 --> 2311.06
 Did you do it?

249
2311.06 --> 2313.06
 Maybe

250
2317.06 --> 2322.54
 I don't know

251
2334.32 --> 2353.31
 I don't know

252
2355.31 --> 2357.31
 It's difficult

253
2357.31 --> 2359.31
 Don't take it

254
2361.31 --> 2363.31
 I can't see

255
2363.31 --> 2365.31
 Can you erase it later?

256
2367.31 --> 2369.31
 If I remember

257
2428.80 --> 2430.80
 I'm tired

258
2430.80 --> 2432.80
 I'm tired

259
2438.50 --> 2440.50
 Move

260
2697.71 --> 2699.71
 It's close

261
2699.71 --> 2701.71
 It's close

262
2724.08 --> 2788.93
 It's close

263
2808.70 --> 2813.23
 It's okay

264
2813.23 --> 2818.78
 It's close

265
2818.78 --> 2820.78
 It's dirty

266
2820.78 --> 2822.78
 It's dirty

267
2822.78 --> 2824.78
 It's mine

268
2833.49 --> 2835.49
 Really?

269
2835.49 --> 2837.49
 It's dirty

270
2856.70 --> 2858.70
 No

271
2860.70 --> 2866.22
 Do you want to play a game?

272
2866.22 --> 2868.22
 Do you want to play a game?

273
2868.22 --> 2872.18
 What do you want to do?

274
2872.18 --> 2874.18
 Sleep

275
2874.18 --> 2876.18
 It's not a game

276
2876.18 --> 2887.81
 What are you doing?

277
2887.81 --> 2889.81
 Good morning

278
2889.81 --> 2891.81
 I'm hungry

279
2891.81 --> 2893.81
 Can I eat it?

280
2893.81 --> 2895.81
 It's dirty

281
2895.81 --> 2897.81
 What are you doing?

282
2898.45 --> 2900.45
 I'm just watching

283
2900.45 --> 2902.45
 What are you watching?

284
2902.45 --> 2904.45
 No

285
2904.45 --> 2908.66
 No

286
2908.66 --> 2912.10
 Is it here?

287
2912.10 --> 2914.10
 Rika is

288
2914.10 --> 2916.10
 making ramen

289
2916.10 --> 2918.10
 We are shooting

290
2918.10 --> 2920.10
 Are you shooting from there?

291
2926.22 --> 2928.22
 Rika-chan cooking

292
2930.22 --> 2932.22
 I'm waiting for it to boil

293
2932.86 --> 2941.01
 I'm waiting

294
2941.01 --> 2946.82
 I don't want to

295
2946.82 --> 2948.82
 Is it ready?

296
2970.53 --> 2972.53
 What's wrong?

297
2972.53 --> 2978.14
 Wait a minute

298
2978.14 --> 2983.12
 Yui is here

299
2983.12 --> 2985.12
 Yui-chan?

300
2985.76 --> 2995.73
 Hey

301
2995.73 --> 2997.73
 It's here

302
2997.73 --> 2999.73
 What?

303
2999.73 --> 3001.73
 I can't let go

304
3001.73 --> 3014.96
 What's wrong?

305
3016.96 --> 3025.39
 I can't

306
3027.39 --> 3032.75
 Yui-chan

307
3037.86 --> 3041.62
 What?

308
3041.62 --> 3046.14
 Should I go upstairs?

309
3046.14 --> 3048.14
 Let's go

310
3067.89 --> 3069.89
 Yui-chan, do you want to eat ramen?

311
3071.89 --> 3073.89
 It's good

312
3073.89 --> 3075.89
 Is it good?

313
3075.89 --> 3077.89
 It's good

314
3077.89 --> 3086.96
 My hands are going to get fat

315
3086.96 --> 3088.96
 What?

316
3090.96 --> 3094.98
 What did you do?

317
3094.98 --> 3099.44
 I did

318
3099.44 --> 3107.68
 You can tell

319
3107.68 --> 3109.68
 Do you

320
3109.68 --> 3111.68
 tell Mika?

321
3111.68 --> 3113.68
 I don't

322
3115.68 --> 3131.82
 Let's go

323
3135.82 --> 3140.16
 Yui-chan

324
3140.16 --> 3142.16
 Do you want to eat ramen?

325
3145.79 --> 3149.94
 Is it good?

326
3154.98 --> 3176.46
 Is it good?

327
3176.46 --> 3212.51
 Is it good?

328
3212.51 --> 3246.61
 Is it good?

329
3252.14 --> 3259.04
 It's good

330
3259.04 --> 3270.93
 I'm full

331
3270.93 --> 3272.93
 I want to go to the bathroom

332
3276.56 --> 3285.38
 Let's go downstairs

333
3287.38 --> 3289.38
 What do you want to do?

334
3291.38 --> 3293.38
 What?

335
3293.38 --> 3300.91
 I want to do something

336
3300.91 --> 3302.91
 That's good

337
3302.91 --> 3306.35
 Do you want to do it together?

338
3306.35 --> 3313.18
 Yes

339
3313.18 --> 3364.50
 Let's do it

340
3364.50 --> 3372.22
 What's next?

341
3372.22 --> 3381.10
 What's after 2?

342
3381.10 --> 3383.10
 Wow

343
3383.10 --> 3385.10
 Hajime, you are so skinny

344
3385.10 --> 3388.10
 You are a pervert

345
3388.10 --> 3390.10
 You are a pervert

346
3390.10 --> 3394.10
 Then, I'll let you sleep here

347
3394.10 --> 3399.59
 What about you, Yui-chan?

348
3402.59 --> 3403.59
 You don't want to sleep?

349
3403.59 --> 3430.01
 You are so cute

350
3432.01 --> 3464.34
 What about here?

351
3465.34 --> 3467.34
 Yui-chan

352
3472.38 --> 3474.38
 That's all?

353
3480.95 --> 3489.45
 I'll take it off

354
3509.00 --> 3511.00
 You are staring at me

355
3512.00 --> 3514.00
 Yui-chan, your boobs are big

356
3525.82 --> 3527.82
 You are a pervert

357
3527.82 --> 3529.82
 You are a pervert

358
3530.82 --> 3546.99
 What are you going to do?

359
3587.04 --> 3589.04
 What about your panties, Yui-chan?

360
3590.04 --> 3592.04
 I'll take it off

361
3593.04 --> 3595.04
 You don't want to

362
3715.41 --> 3753.22
 Why are you staring at me?

363
3753.22 --> 3757.04
 Don't

364
3757.04 --> 3759.04
 I don't like it

365
3759.04 --> 3761.04
 I like it

366
3761.04 --> 3763.04
 Right, Yui-chan?

367
3764.04 --> 3766.04
 I'm staring at you

368
3767.04 --> 3771.44
 You are staring at me, right?

369
3773.44 --> 3811.50
 What?

370
3811.50 --> 3813.50
 I'm staring at you

371
3813.50 --> 3817.90
 Can't I touch you?

372
3823.26 --> 3825.26
 I'm not close to you

373
3825.26 --> 3827.26
 I like it

374
3827.26 --> 3829.26
 Let me see

375
3831.26 --> 3833.26
 What are you doing?

376
3833.26 --> 3838.62
 I'm staring at you

377
3849.70 --> 3864.86
 You are a pervert

378
3864.86 --> 3866.86
 Why?

379
3866.86 --> 3868.86
 Why?

380
3868.86 --> 3870.86
 You are cute

381
3873.86 --> 3877.62
 I'm standing

382
3877.62 --> 3881.31
 Why are you standing?

383
3882.31 --> 3884.31
 Don't mind me

384
3884.31 --> 3886.31
 I'll mind you

385
3888.31 --> 3890.31
 You are cute

386
3891.31 --> 3893.31
 Really?

387
3894.31 --> 3919.80
 I like it

388
3920.80 --> 3922.80
 I'm taking a video

389
3926.80 --> 3928.80
 Keep going

390
3928.80 --> 3959.89
 It's fun

391
3959.89 --> 3963.39
 You were taking a video

392
3963.39 --> 3965.39
 I was

393
3965.39 --> 3976.38
 Wow

394
3976.38 --> 4010.19
 Is it good?

395
4042.88 --> 4051.70
 You are shaking

396
4057.29 --> 4059.29
 Say something

397
4099.22 --> 4101.22
 It's funny

398
4102.22 --> 4104.22
 This face

399
4306.45 --> 4320.38
 You are a pervert

400
4352.37 --> 4354.37
 What do you want to drink?

401
4355.37 --> 4360.09
 This

402
4360.09 --> 4362.09
 Okay

403
4365.66 --> 4367.66
 Give me money

404
4367.66 --> 4369.66
 Why?

405
4369.66 --> 4374.44
 I don't care

406
4374.44 --> 4380.25
 What should I do?

407
4380.25 --> 4449.22
 I'm going to call Yui

408
4454.58 --> 4456.58
 Excuse me

409
4521.25 --> 4523.25
 She is here

410
4523.25 --> 4525.25
 Good morning

411
4535.93 --> 4537.93
 Be gentle

412
4545.28 --> 4547.28
 She is sleeping

413
4551.28 --> 4553.28
 You are cute

414
4561.28 --> 4565.04
 Good morning

415
4568.04 --> 4570.04
 Is it ticklish?

416
4570.04 --> 4572.04
 Yes

417
4573.04 --> 4580.26
 She is blushing

418
4582.26 --> 4584.26
 Let me see

419
4589.26 --> 4595.00
 Let me see

420
4595.00 --> 4597.00
 You are cute

421
4599.00 --> 4605.35
 She is out

422
4611.30 --> 4613.30
 I won't let you go

423
4617.30 --> 4619.30
 You are cute

424
4628.68 --> 4630.68
 You are cute

425
4635.12 --> 4637.12
 You are blushing

426
4637.12 --> 4639.12
 You are blushing

427
4644.75 --> 4646.75
 It feels good

428
4670.93 --> 4672.93
 You are taking a video

429
4673.93 --> 4675.93
 Don't take a video

430
4675.93 --> 4677.93
 It's good

431
4677.93 --> 4685.46
 What are you taking a video of?

432
4685.46 --> 4687.46
 Boob

433
4687.46 --> 4689.46
 It's close

434
4696.29 --> 4698.29
 It's difficult

435
4698.29 --> 4700.29
 What are you doing?

436
4705.29 --> 4707.29
 She is taking a video

437
4707.29 --> 4709.29
 What are you doing?

438
4710.29 --> 4712.29
 What?

439
4712.29 --> 4714.29
 She is taking a video

440
4714.29 --> 4716.29
 Don't disturb me

441
4723.90 --> 4725.90
 It's good

442
4725.90 --> 4730.94
 I was taking a video

443
4735.94 --> 4737.94
 Don't

444
4737.94 --> 4739.94
 I won't let you touch

445
4741.94 --> 4743.94
 Why?

446
4743.94 --> 4745.94
 Don't

447
4745.94 --> 4747.94
 Don't

448
4747.94 --> 4749.94
 It's difficult

449
4749.94 --> 4751.94
 It's not fair

450
4756.94 --> 4763.20
 She is taking a video

451
4766.20 --> 4768.20
 It's good

452
4770.90 --> 4772.90
 It's difficult

453
4787.86 --> 4789.86
 Don't

454
4789.86 --> 4791.86
 Don't?

455
4791.86 --> 4793.86
 It's good

456
4802.46 --> 4804.46
 What?

457
4807.46 --> 4809.46
 What?

458
4809.46 --> 4812.90
 What?

459
4813.90 --> 4815.90
 She is looking at you

460
4815.90 --> 4817.90
 You are a pervert

461
4824.94 --> 4826.94
 She is coming

462
4826.94 --> 4828.94
 She is licking you

463
4829.94 --> 4831.94
 It's difficult

464
4832.94 --> 4834.94
 You licked me yesterday

465
4834.94 --> 4836.94
 It's good

466
4836.94 --> 4838.94
 Don't disturb me

467
4840.94 --> 4842.94
 She is licking you

468
4843.94 --> 4845.94
 Don't do that

469
4862.40 --> 4864.40
 You are a pervert

470
4864.40 --> 4866.40
 Why?

471
4881.18 --> 4883.18
 Don't do that

472
4883.18 --> 4885.18
 She is licking you

473
4885.18 --> 4889.38
 Just a little

474
4891.38 --> 4893.38
 She is licking you

475
4912.87 --> 4914.87
 She is licking you

476
4914.87 --> 4916.87
 She is licking you

477
4920.87 --> 4922.87
 Look at her

478
4922.87 --> 4924.87
 She is licking you

479
4957.40 --> 4959.40
 She is licking you

480
4959.40 --> 4961.40
 I'm sorry

481
4977.70 --> 4979.70
 It's good

482
4979.70 --> 4981.70
 It's good

483
4997.77 --> 4999.77
 It's a blood vessel

484
4999.77 --> 5001.77
 Is it a blood vessel?

485
5001.77 --> 5003.77
 I don't know

486
5005.77 --> 5007.77
 I don't know

487
5007.77 --> 5009.77
 It's getting bigger

488
5018.41 --> 5020.41
 Lick here

489
5020.41 --> 5024.81
 Here?

490
5024.81 --> 5026.81
 Here?

491
5032.81 --> 5044.38
 She is grinning

492
5044.38 --> 5046.38
 It's gross

493
5046.38 --> 5048.38
 Why?

494
5048.38 --> 5050.38
 It's gross

495
5104.44 --> 5151.21
 It's gross

496
5161.51 --> 5163.51
 It's on your nose

497
5163.51 --> 5165.51
 It's getting bigger

498
5237.95 --> 5239.95
 Is it good?

499
5252.74 --> 5254.74
 It's a sandwich

500
5277.48 --> 5279.48
 It's a sandwich

501
5378.97 --> 5380.97
 It's a sandwich

502
5385.54 --> 5387.54
 What are you doing?

503
5387.54 --> 5389.54
 It feels good

504
5397.91 --> 5399.91
 You poor thing

505
5429.07 --> 5435.46
 You poor thing

506
5455.15 --> 5460.51
 You poor thing

507
5499.58 --> 5513.33
 Did you take it out?

508
5519.92 --> 5521.92
 It's dirty

509
5521.92 --> 5523.92
 What are you doing?

510
5527.49 --> 5531.57
 Give me a peck

511
5533.88 --> 5535.88
 What?

512
5535.88 --> 5537.88
 What are you doing?

513
5560.64 --> 5562.64
 It's gross

514
5589.35 --> 5593.94
 Let's eat after she comes

515
5594.94 --> 5598.90
 Are you hungry?

516
5598.90 --> 5600.90
 Yui-chan

517
5600.90 --> 5602.90
 I'm eating

518
5602.90 --> 5604.90
 I was eating

519
5604.90 --> 5606.90
 It's dirty

520
5606.90 --> 5610.98
 Do you want to eat?

521
5610.98 --> 5635.38
 It's good

522
5635.38 --> 5637.38
 It's good

523
5642.07 --> 5644.07
 This egg is crushed

524
5644.07 --> 5646.07
 It's crushed

525
5646.07 --> 5648.07
 You brought it to me

526
5648.07 --> 5650.07
 It's clean

527
5666.22 --> 5668.22
 It's gross

528
5670.22 --> 5677.06
 What did you do?

529
5677.06 --> 5679.06
 I don't know

530
5679.06 --> 5681.06
 I brought it

531
5681.06 --> 5683.06
 What did you bring?

532
5683.06 --> 5685.06
 I don't know

533
5685.06 --> 5687.06
 I brought something

534
5688.06 --> 5690.06
 It's a mystery

535
5690.06 --> 5702.58
 You ate all the egg

536
5703.58 --> 5705.58
 It was good even though it was crushed

537
5705.58 --> 5707.58
 It was good

538
5724.36 --> 5726.36
 What?

539
5726.36 --> 5728.36
 What? Are you still eating?

540
5728.36 --> 5731.74
 I haven't finished eating

541
5731.74 --> 5733.74
 I don't want to

542
5733.74 --> 5735.74
 I don't want to

543
5735.74 --> 5737.74
 What are you doing?

544
5742.74 --> 5744.74
 I haven't finished eating yet

545
5754.46 --> 5756.46
 You are energetic

546
5760.54 --> 5762.54
 You are in a good mood

547
5881.94 --> 5883.94
 Are you sleepy?

548
5883.94 --> 5885.94
 You are sleepy

549
5888.77 --> 5894.26
 What is that?

550
5894.26 --> 5896.26
 Are you going to sleep here again?

551
5909.87 --> 5911.87
 Are you going to sleep here again?

552
5987.10 --> 6003.27
 Go home

553
6003.27 --> 6005.27
 Why?

554
6006.27 --> 6018.03
 You are crazy

555
6022.78 --> 6039.34
 Go home

556
6039.34 --> 6043.48
 I'm sleepy

557
6043.48 --> 6045.48
 I'm sleepy

558
6045.48 --> 6047.48
 Go home

559
6047.48 --> 6049.48
 Why?

560
6075.23 --> 6077.23
 Are you going to sleep here again today?

561
6085.75 --> 6087.75
 I'm sleepy

562
6089.75 --> 6091.75
 Go home

563
6092.75 --> 6094.75
 Go home

564
6102.30 --> 6104.30
 Go home

565
6104.30 --> 6106.30
 Go home

566
6288.50 --> 6290.50
 Let's go home.

567
6290.50 --> 6294.39
 Why?

568
6294.39 --> 6296.39
 Let's go home.

569
6324.04 --> 6339.03
 It's the first time.

570
6339.03 --> 6341.03
 I won.

571
6341.03 --> 6343.03
 I'm happy.

572
6359.40 --> 6361.40
 I'm so happy.

573
6363.40 --> 6365.40
 I drank too much.

574
6365.40 --> 6367.40
 Everyone, let's go home.

575
6375.08 --> 6396.85
 Rika-chan, where are you?

576
6396.85 --> 6398.85
 Where are you?

577
6398.85 --> 6401.85
 Are you going to sleep here again today?

578
6403.85 --> 6405.85
 I think she went home.

579
6407.85 --> 6430.08
 She disappeared before I knew it.

580
6430.08 --> 6434.67
 What?

581
6434.67 --> 6442.34
 Rika.

582
6442.34 --> 6446.74
 Rika.

583
6465.53 --> 6467.53
 She ate a lot.

584
6467.53 --> 6469.53
 Why are you eating?

585
6469.53 --> 6472.53
 You eat a lot even though you are thin.

586
6472.53 --> 6474.53
 Are you full?

587
6474.53 --> 6475.53
 I'm full.

588
6475.53 --> 6477.53
 I'm too full.

589
6478.53 --> 6480.53
 I don't like it either.

590
6481.53 --> 6483.53
 Can I eat this?

591
6483.53 --> 6484.53
 Can I eat this?

592
6484.53 --> 6485.53
 Are you full?

593
6485.53 --> 6487.53
 Only the ears are delicious.

594
6487.53 --> 6489.53
 It's hard.

595
6490.53 --> 6492.53
 Did you eat a lot?

596
6492.53 --> 6493.53
 Yes.

597
6493.53 --> 6494.53
 Was it delicious?

598
6494.53 --> 6498.67
 Go home.

599
6498.67 --> 6500.67
 Are you going to sleep?

600
6500.67 --> 6502.67
 Are you going to sleep?

601
6516.61 --> 6518.61
 I'm not angry at you.

602
6518.61 --> 6531.01
 Really?

603
6531.01 --> 6533.01
 Don't say that.

604
6534.01 --> 6541.86
 I'm not crying.

605
6543.86 --> 6545.86
 I'm not crying.

606
6548.86 --> 6594.52
 Are you going to sleep here again today?

607
6594.52 --> 6603.98
 No.

608
6603.98 --> 6605.98
 I'm too full.

609
6605.98 --> 6606.98
 Rika.

610
6606.98 --> 6608.98
 Are you going to sleep?

611
6608.98 --> 6610.98
 I'm going to sleep.

612
6675.12 --> 6678.12
 Are you going to sleep here again today?

613
6682.61 --> 6686.61
 Rika is sleeping.

614
6687.61 --> 6692.01
 Don't wake me up.

615
6695.01 --> 6708.37
 Are you going to sleep?

616
6709.37 --> 6711.37
 I'm going to sleep.

617
6711.37 --> 6716.41
 Are you going to sleep?

618
6716.41 --> 6718.41
 I'm going to sleep.

619
6719.41 --> 6733.06
 I'm too full.

620
6733.06 --> 6735.06
 Rika.

621
6855.02 --> 6859.03
 I'm working.

622
6863.03 --> 6865.03
 I'm home now.

623
6865.03 --> 6868.03
 You're going to sleep here today.

624
6869.03 --> 6879.64
 I'm home now.

625
6887.33 --> 6889.33
 I'm working.

626
6890.33 --> 6894.92
 I'm home now.

627
6894.92 --> 6896.92
 Let's get up.

628
6900.92 --> 6902.92
 Kana, don't wake up.

629
6904.92 --> 6906.92
 Wow, you are amazing.

630
6935.58 --> 6937.58
 I'm sorry, I drank too much.

631
6963.38 --> 6967.46
 I'm going home.

632
6967.46 --> 6969.46
 I won't wake you up if you don't wake up.

633
6969.46 --> 6971.46
 Hey!

634
6999.79 --> 7001.79
 Are you going to sleep?

635
7001.79 --> 7003.79
 Are you going to sleep?

636
7010.13 --> 7012.13
 I'm going home.

637
7019.92 --> 7021.92
 He went inside.

638
7021.92 --> 7026.68
 I've never seen him in such a bright place.

639
7026.68 --> 7028.68
 I'm going home.

640
7032.57 --> 7033.57
 Don't do that.

641
7033.57 --> 7035.57
 Do you want me to put my finger in your mouth?

642
7035.57 --> 7037.57
 No, I don't want to.

643
7037.57 --> 7039.57
 No, I don't want to.

644
7040.57 --> 7042.57
 I'm going home.

645
7076.10 --> 7078.10
 Are you going to sleep here tonight?

646
7092.97 --> 7093.97
 Do you want to sleep?

647
7104.00 --> 7106.00
 I'm going home.

648
7134.14 --> 7136.14
 Are you going to sleep?

649
7136.14 --> 7201.21
 I don't want to sleep.

650
7201.21 --> 7208.68
 I'm going home.

651
7208.68 --> 7210.68
 Do you want me to put my finger in your mouth?

652
7210.68 --> 7231.40
 I'm going home.

653
7232.40 --> 7234.40
 I'm going home.

654
7234.40 --> 7242.32
 I'm going home.

655
7242.32 --> 7260.35
 Go home!

656
7260.35 --> 7262.35
 Why?

657
7262.35 --> 7280.51
 Go home!

658
7280.51 --> 7284.21
 Go home!

659
7284.21 --> 7286.21
 Why?

660
7286.21 --> 7288.21
 Go home!

661
7288.21 --> 7293.18
 I won't get up if you do that.

662
7293.18 --> 7295.18
 Go home!

663
7295.18 --> 7300.29
 Go home!

664
7300.29 --> 7302.29
 Why?

665
7302.29 --> 7304.29
 Go home!

666
7767.32 --> 7769.32
 Who did you get up?

667
7808.84 --> 7810.84
 Are you going to sleep here again?

668
7811.84 --> 7812.84
 Are you going to sleep?

669
7826.10 --> 7827.10
 Yes, I will.

670
7851.85 --> 7852.85
 Go home!

671
7852.85 --> 7853.85
 Why?

672
7864.22 --> 7866.22
 Are you going to sleep here again?

673
7866.22 --> 7868.22
 Are you going to sleep here?

674
7868.22 --> 7873.32
 Go home!

675
7873.32 --> 7875.32
 I'll kill you!

676
7875.32 --> 7892.01
 Go home!

677
7900.01 --> 7909.66
 Go home!

678
7909.66 --> 7911.66
 I'll kill you!

679
7911.66 --> 7913.66
 Go home!

680
7995.20 --> 8001.62
 Are you going to sleep here today?

681
8045.27 --> 8073.54
 Don't sleep!

682
8073.54 --> 8075.54
 Go home!

683
8075.54 --> 8088.65
 If you go tomorrow, I'll kill you!

684
8088.65 --> 8090.65
 Go home!

685
8090.65 --> 8097.74
 I'll kill you!

686
8099.74 --> 8101.74
 Don't sleep!

687
8101.74 --> 8128.50
 If you go tomorrow, I'll kill you!

688
8128.50 --> 8130.50
 Go home!

689
8130.50 --> 8132.50
 I'll kill you!

690
8170.44 --> 8176.44
 This is what a souvenir rice cracker usually tastes like, isn't it?

691
8182.44 --> 8184.44
 But I can eat it at all.

692
8192.64 --> 8194.64
 Well, I'm not sure.

693
8194.64 --> 8196.64
 Even if you say so.

694
8212.86 --> 8214.86
 Oh, welcome.

695
8228.61 --> 8229.61
 Senbei.

696
8229.61 --> 8230.61
 Senbei?

697
8240.23 --> 8242.23
 I'm so sleepy.

698
8247.23 --> 8248.23
 Hey, Choco.

699
8253.36 --> 8255.36
 Isn't it different from usual?

700
8260.50 --> 8261.50
 Are you sleepy?

701
8261.50 --> 8262.50
 What?

702
8262.50 --> 8264.50
 Yes, I'm sleepy.

703
8267.01 --> 8268.01
 Why?

704
8272.01 --> 8273.01
 I'm sleepy.

705
8276.01 --> 8277.01
 Oh, wow.

706
8289.47 --> 8290.47
 When?

707
8291.47 --> 8292.47
 Well...

708
8300.85 --> 8301.85
 How was it?

709
8301.85 --> 8302.85
 It was great, wasn't it?

710
8302.85 --> 8303.85
 What?

711
8305.85 --> 8306.85
 You finally got what you wanted.

712
8307.85 --> 8309.85
 I really wanted it.

713
8309.85 --> 8311.85
 I can't say anything.

714
8312.85 --> 8314.85
 Don't you remember how many times I attacked you?

715
8314.85 --> 8315.85
 No, I don't.

716
8316.85 --> 8321.34
 Are you going to sleep?

717
8321.34 --> 8322.34
 What?

718
8322.34 --> 8324.34
 Yes, I'm going to sleep.

719
8334.24 --> 8338.51
 I'm sorry. I drank too much.

720
8339.51 --> 8340.51
 I don't care.
