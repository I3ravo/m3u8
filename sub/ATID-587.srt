1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,000
This is good.

2
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,480
Welcome back.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
I love you.

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,560
I love you, too.

5
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
I love you, too.

6
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,160
The rice is ready.

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,660
I don't need it.

8
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:43,160
Eat it first.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Later.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,940
I don't need it.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,640
I don't need it.

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,790
Half a year ago, I had
an older boyfriend named Shigeki, but I got

13
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:10,810
married to a young Shunji from the same
company who had already attacked.

14
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,470
Shigeki, a playboy,
quit the company and became normal.

15
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,730
My choice was not wrong.

16
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,770
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,390
He comes home every day,
without a detour, and hugs me right away.

18
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,790
So I always wake up late at night.

19
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,430
Oh, no.

20
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,850
Not there.

21
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,350
What? No, not there.

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Sorry.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,990


25
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,290
I was in a hurry.
I didn't want to tell you.

26
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,610
It's okay. I just took a short nap.

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,690
Oh, I'm sorry. What am I doing?

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,750
I made a terrible mistake.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,810
Don't worry about it. I was surprised.

30
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,590
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,870
It's okay.

32
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,650
It's delicious.

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,630
Really?

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,010
Yes.

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,250
But it's cold.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,150
It's not my
fault, is it? Yes, it is.

37
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,151


38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,030
Why?

39
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,250
It's not your fault, is it?

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,770
What? Is
it my fault? No, it's not.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,490
Really?

42
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,930
I may have known a new pleasure.

43
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,510
When the tip of my husband's genitalia,
which I had not expected, was pulled out,

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,270
At that time, I was surprised at the feeling
that something was going to come out.

45
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,570
But I can't say that to a serious husband.

46
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,678
I've never been worried
about it before, but

47
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,400
the hole in my butt
is still a sexual organ.

48
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:22,220
It is said that you get
pleasure when you make a hole in something.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,800
Certainly, when I entered
and left my husband's room last night,

50
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,700
I had a pleasant feeling
that I had never felt before.

51
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,050
I can't see well.

52
00:04:32,265 --> 00:07:09,470
I can't go.

53
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,910
No, I can't. What am
I doing? It feels good.

54
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,390


55
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,680
The messenger was my ex-husband, Shigeki.

56
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,040
Why didn't I block him when we got married?

57
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:04,480
When I found out that my husband couldn't
accept this, my desire became even bigger.

58
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,070
Shunji, why?

59
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:14,930
I was wondering if you were
happy after leaving me and marrying Shunji.

60
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,770
Do you feel like you
have to clean your ass during the day?

61
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,890
Hey, hey, hey,
you've become a ridiculous pervert.

62
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,330
No, no.

63
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,530
What's the difference?
I've been watching you all the time.

64
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:29,531
What is it?

65
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,650
Don't make a noise.

66
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
What are you
doing? Hey, hey, hey.

67
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,390


68
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,270
Your butt is hitting me.

69
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
Are you trying to seduce me?

70
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,010
No.

71
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,470
You are, aren't you?

72
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:55,270
It's not like I don't know you.

73
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,370
What?

74
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,250
Do you remember
the taste of the ass hole? Let me see.

75
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,610


76
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,790
No, it's not that.

77
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,530
What? Please, don't.

78
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,730


79
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,930
It's a little spread, isn't it?

80
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,890
No, it's not that.

81
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,270
What?

82
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,230
What?
When did you learn the taste of blood vein?

83
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,250
Does he know?

84
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,290
No.

85
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,010
Please.

86
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,830
What? You learned the taste
of blood vein, didn't you? Don't do it.

87
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,990
Don't do it.

88
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,230


89
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,540
Do you want me to give you a butt massage?

90
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
No, I don't want to.

91
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,340
You've had a lot of sex, haven't you?

92
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,420
Have you had a lot of sex?

93
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:18,560
How do you feel?

94
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
How do you feel? Oh, I see.

95
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,500
Oh, I see.

96
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,300


97
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,140
Stay still, Natsuki.

98
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Stay still.

99
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't cry.

100
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,650
Hey, hey, hey,
you can feel it, can't you? No, I can't.

101
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,090
No, I can't.

102
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:00,550
No, I can't.

103
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:01,551
Hey, Asuki.

104
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,990


105
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,470
I'll teach you the goodness of blood.

106
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,140
It's been a long time
since I did this with you.

107
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,500
How is it?
Did you have a good marriage life?

108
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,430
Maybe you didn't have a good marriage life.

109
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,290
That's why
you were playing with your butthole.

110
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,811
You were playing
with me, weren't you? You are a girl.

111
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,210
I'm scared.

112
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:35,860
You are quiet.

113
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,780


114
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,260
Manko is getting wet.

115
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
It's bitter.

116
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,880
I'll make you feel it with my butt.

117
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:19,881
I'll give you a massage.

118
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,210
Be quiet.

119
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,200
You have a lot of blood vessels.

120
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,620
It's been a long time
since you had a pussy.

121
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,690
You still have a lot of pussy.

122
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,630
How's the blood?

123
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,530
No.

124
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,270
What? No, no, no.

125
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,430
Stay still.

126
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580


127
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,760
You'll get hurt if you go wild.

128
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,200
I'll show you the good side of a butt.

129
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Here.

130
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:32,620
How is it?

131
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,420
How is it?

132
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Tatsuki, how is it?

133
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,130
How deep did you put it in?

134
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,130
Did you put it
in deeply? Here? Coco.

135
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620


136
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340


137
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,130
Hey.

138
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,780
Which one of you feels better?

139
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,730
Hey.

140
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Hey, Nasuki, answer me.
Which one do you prefer?

141
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Which one do you prefer?

142
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,930
Like this?

143
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:09,440
Hey, hey, if you
move your butt, your butt will get wet.

144
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,690
Good boy.

145
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,550
You have a little more space.

146
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,760
You are too fat. Look at this.

147
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,800
How about this? Here you are.

148
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:02,710
Look.

149
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Hey, hey, hey.

150
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,850


151
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,310
You have a big hole in your butt.

152
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:53,550
I'm going to sleep.

153
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,420
I'm going to sleep.

154
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,421
Did you fall asleep?

155
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,480
Do you feel good?

156
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,970
Oh...

157
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,720
OK, stay still.

158
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
Stay still.

159
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,140
Hey, it's easy to get in.

160
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,860
Next, the butthole.

161
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,560
I didn't tell you to give
up your body, did I?

162
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
You feel it, don't you?

163
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,760
I didn't tell you
to give up your body, did I? No, I didn't.

164
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,840
You did.

165
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,160
No, I didn't.

166
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,740
Yes, you did.

167
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760


168
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,300
You feel it, don't you?

169
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:33,661
Do you want
to go to the bathroom? Hey, Natsuki.

170
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,640


171
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,280
I'll let you go to the bathroom.

172
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,880
It's been a long
time since you went to the bathroom.

173
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,190
Come here.

174
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,970
I can't.

175
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,290
I can't.

176
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,070
I'm sorry.

177
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,151
I'll let you sniff my dick.

178
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,110
I'm sorry.

179
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,310
It's okay.

180
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,170
Come here.

181
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,290
I'm sorry.

182
00:29:41,750 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm sorry.

183
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,140
Please do more.

184
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm sorry.

185
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,800
I'm sorry.

186
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,000
You don't have to apologize.

187
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,580
You were happy to eat this before.

188
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,570
Hey, Natsuki.

189
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:21,700
Hey, Natsuki.

190
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
OK.

191
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
I don't want it.

192
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Take off your clothes.

193
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I don't want it.

194
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,600
I don't want it.

195
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,540
Stay still.

196
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,580
I don't want it.

197
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
I don't want it.

198
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,580
I don't want it.

199
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:11,941
You don't know if you don't do it.

200
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,040
Take off your clothes.

201
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,830
Stay still.

202
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:37,650
Don't do that.

203
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,710
Come on.

204
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,770
Don't be wild.

205
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,900
What's wrong? Come on.

206
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,320
Come on.

207
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,340


208
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,460
This is the first time for me.

209
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,950
You don't want
to be touched, do you? Here you go.

210
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,870


211
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,350
You don't want to be touched, do you?

212
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,750
I can't do it anymore.

213
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,990
Are you getting
better? I'm sorry.

214
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,750
I'm okay.

215
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,090
Stop it.

216
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,730
Stay still.

217
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,550
I'm sorry.

218
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,610
Do you have a hole in your butt?

219
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,810
I'm going to break.

220
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,630
You're getting used to it, aren't you?

221
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,630
Okay, I'm going to do more.

222
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,150
Stop it.

223
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,470
How do you feel, Natsuki?

224
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,770
Show me your face when you feel pain.

225
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,870
Oh, it's painful,
isn't it? It's painful.

226
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,210


227
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,190
It feels good, doesn't it?

228
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,530
Don't look at me.

229
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,850
It feels good,
doesn't it? I love you.

230
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,850
Come here.

231
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,270
Come here.

232
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,590
Come here.

233
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,990


234
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,450
Hey.

235
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Hey.

236
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Stay still.

237
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,080
Look, I love you.

238
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,420
I'm sorry.

239
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
How do you feel?

240
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,820
Do you feel better?

241
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,080
Say you feel better.

242
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,700
You feel good
this morning, don't you? No, I don't.

243
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:26,380


244
00:38:53,120 --> 00:39:02,360
I love you so much.

245
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,390
It feels good, doesn't it, Natsuki?

246
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,746
If you feel anything,
say it with your butt.

247
00:39:50,770 --> 00:40:01,720
Stop it, Sarai-chan, stop it.

248
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
I can't stop.

249
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,200
It's heavy, isn't it?
Here you are.

250
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,820


251
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,800
It hurts, doesn't it?

252
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:22,960
Don't touch me!

253
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,260
It's just a hole in your butt.

254
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
No!

255
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
No! No! I'm sorry.

256
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480


257
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,650
Get out of here.

258
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,290
Get out of here.

259
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,190
Anna, don't be angry.

260
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,310
Get out of here.

261
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
What's wrong with her?

262
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,180
She is late today.

263
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,560
What's wrong with
you today? Hi, Natsuki.

264
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Shigeki.

265
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520


266
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,400
Natsuki, long time no see.

267
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,920
It's Senpai, Senpai.

268
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,140
I happened to
meet you on my way back from work.

269
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,200
I've been drinking all this time.

270
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Senpai.

271
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,980
Natsuki-san, it's been a while.

272
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,930
You look happy.

273
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,640
Senpai, let's continue drinking.

274
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,220
Come over here.

275
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,580
That's right.

276
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,780
Well then, excuse me.

277
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,830
Here you are.

278
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Here you are.

279
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,960
Have a drink.

280
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,160
Thank you.

281
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,820
It's been a while.

282
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,700
Thank you.

283
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,600
Thank you, Natsuki.

284
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
It's so delicious.

285
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
What's up, Natsuki? Have a seat.

286
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,340
Hey, why did you quit your job?

287
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,620
Well, I wanted to be independent.

288
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,300
I'm glad I quit my job.

289
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm so sad to hear that.

290
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,280
I'm so glad when you two became my
subordinates.

291
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,140
We wanted to invite you to our wedding.

292
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,290
I'm sorry.

293
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,161
I didn't know you were gone.

294
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

295
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:11,545
I'm glad you're okay.

296
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,100
What's wrong with
you, Natsuki? Drink it.

297
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,740


298
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:20,635
Well, well, well.

299
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,020
You have a lot of things.

300
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,320
A lot of things?

301
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,580
What do you mean?

302
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,160
What's that, Natsuki?

303
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,540
Look, look, look.

304
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:28,660
A lot of things.

305
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,460
I can cut a man who
doesn't understand his wife's feelings.

306
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,440
Oh, really?

307
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
You're going to be cut?

308
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,260
We love each
other, don't we, Natsuki? Here you are.

309
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,260
Thank you.

310
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,220


311
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,720
Senpai, can you stop drinking today?

312
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Can I?

313
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,740
I don't know what to say.

314
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,220
Are you OK, Natsuki?
Yes, I'm fine.

315
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,720
Please stop.

316
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:57,840
OK, I'll stop.

317
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,680


318
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,630
Don't just stand there. Come here.

319
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,720
I heard you do it every day.

320
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:15,860
I'm here today, so
if you can't do it, you'll be disappointed.

321
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,280
Please go home.

322
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,040
Shunji told you to stay.

323
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:34,600
Shunji, what do you
think if you find out that you like butt?

324
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,280
I'm sure you'll get burned.

325
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:41,601
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

326
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,500
Do you want me to
make a hole in your butthole again?

327
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,771
You didn't look like you wanted to do
it at all when you first did it.

328
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,451
You'll get
a cramp if you think you can do it again.

329
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,520
Do you understand, Natsuki-san?

330
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:36,570
Show me your butt.

331
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:57,570
I can feel it.

332
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,190
Do you understand, Natsuki-san?

333
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,100
Oh, you're getting excited.

334
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,001
I want to put you in this butt again.

335
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:43,560
Don't run away.

336
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,420
Stay still.

337
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:49,421
What are you doing?

338
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,240
Is this your butthole?

339
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Your body is trembling.

340
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:46,770
Here? Here it is.

341
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,390
Show me.

342
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,310
Stay still.

343
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,910


344
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,180
Natsuki, are you making a baby cry?

345
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,120
You can spread it by
yourself, can't you? Do it.

346
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,380
Do it.

347
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,460


348
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,130
You like your
buttocks, don't you? Spread it more.

349
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,810
That's right.

350
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,100
Use your strength.

351
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,590
Do you feel it?

352
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,310
Huh?

353
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,121
You are getting excited just by looking
at the camera, aren't you? That's right.

354
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:57,360
That's right. More.

355
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
Huh?

356
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,840
Do you get a cramp if you tilt your butt?

357
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,060
Huh?

358
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,730
You look excited.

359
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,450
I'm sorry.

360
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
It's too early.

361
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,161
If you're in a hurry, you'll hear it.

362
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,280
It's too early, Natsuki.

363
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,430
Keep your voice down.

364
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:27,430
It's too early, Natsuki.

365
00:55:27,431 --> 00:55:28,431
You are so cute.

366
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,510
You are so cute.

367
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:51,690
Let me see.

368
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,630
Here you are.

369
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,750
Look.

370
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,990
Do you feel your butthole? Look.

371
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,590


372
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:36,780
【Neko-kichi's
mom】 【Neko-kichi's brother】

373
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,080
【Neko-kichi's mom】

374
00:57:54,570 --> 00:58:27,080
【Neko-kichi's brother】

375
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:51,100
Matsuki, I brought you something nice.
I hope you like it.

376
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,660
What is it?

377
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,940
I'll make you
feel more of your buttocks with this.

378
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:04,990
I don't want it.

379
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,040
I don't want it.

380
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,700
I'll keep quiet.

381
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,990
Can you see? She's crying more and more.

382
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,120
I'm sorry.

383
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,320
Do you feel better? Okay.

384
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,110
Please do more.

385
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:12,620
Please do more.

386
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,400


387
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,670
I can't hear you.

388
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,940
Please do more.

389
01:00:46,140 --> 01:01:00,110
This is not an android.

390
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,170
This is a baby.

391
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,650
Oh? Not yet.

392
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,230
One more.

393
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:16,790


394
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,500
You can eat one more.

395
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,520
Here we go.

396
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:46,730
Here you are.

397
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:48,990
It hurts.

398
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,890
It doesn't matter. Open your chest.

399
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:55,270
That's right.

400
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:30,460
One more time.

401
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,370
Here you are.

402
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,290
It's going in smoothly.

403
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,080
It's easy, isn't it?

404
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,740
I can't hear you. What
did you say? I feel bad.

405
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,020
I'm sorry.

406
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:09,021


407
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:36,650
I'm going
to open your eyes and your buttocks.

408
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:59,520
It's a good girl.

409
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Good.

410
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:05,730
You're moving again.

411
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,580
Look.

412
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,660
You're getting a new outfit.

413
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:18,490
You can't live like this.

414
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,000
You want to be a nun, don't you?

415
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,370
You do, don't you?

416
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:33,410
I'll give you a head-butt.

417
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:34,411
I'll do my best.

418
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:54,815
This time,
I will talk about the story of the old man

419
01:06:54,827 --> 01:06:58,200
who fell asleep
while playing in the middle of the night.

420
01:06:58,201 --> 01:07:00,516
The story of the old man who fell asleep
while playing in the middle of the night.

421
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,906
In the middle of the night,
he was sleeping with his back to the bed.

422
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,411
You like it, don't you?
It's good for your butthole, isn't it?

423
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:25,240
Oh, I can't stop.

424
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,851
Okay, I'll give you a shot in the butthole.

425
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:14,070
Natsuki, I'll give you
a shot in the butthole.

426
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:20,770
I'll give you a shot in the butthole.

427
01:08:35,105 --> 01:08:37,070
Put your hands on your belly.

428
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,870
Now, beg for more.

429
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,550
Open your buttocks and beg for more.

430
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:49,710
Yes, yes, please put
one foot in my buttocks.

431
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:57,370
Please put one foot in my buttocks.

432
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,610
Are you a corpse?

433
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,730
Yes, I want to do it.

434
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:06,550
Please.

435
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,350
Is this it?

436
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,390
Is this it?

437
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,310
Is this it?

438
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:37,090
thank you very much.

439
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,810
More, please.

440
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,030
More, please.

441
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,870
You have to use your hips if you feel good.

442
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,370
Here you go.

443
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,160
Try to use your hips.

444
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:58,630
More.

445
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:56,680
This is a video with no sound.

446
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:12,740
This video is
a derivative work of the Touhou Project.

447
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:12,780
If you are okay with
this video, please give us a high rating.

448
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,800
Thank you very much.

449
01:12:39,470 --> 01:13:57,680
The baby's crying
is getting louder and louder.

450
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:44,860
The baby is crying
while putting his face on the baby's back.

451
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:46,880
Give me more blood.

452
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:36,890
You look like you love the butthole.

453
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,230
What do you like?

454
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,370
You like it?

455
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,480
I like the butthole.

456
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,410
Tell me you like the butthole.

457
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,670
Give me more blood.

458
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:54,310
Are you okay?

459
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:01,780
Are you okay? All right.

460
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:01,880


461
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,460
Put your head down.

462
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,780
Oh, you're getting better.

463
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,720
I'm happy.

464
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:53,160
Oh, you're getting better.

465
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,100
All right.

466
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:45,110
He is taking a bath in the hot spring bath.

467
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,970
He is cleaning his butt.

468
01:17:52,971 --> 01:17:55,150
Do you clean your butt?

469
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,760
Look at my butthole.

470
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,160
I'm going to take it out today.

471
01:20:16,555 --> 01:20:18,516
It's my favorite night,
so I'm going to leave it.

472
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:46,800
I'll take you to the station.

473
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,040
Please come to play again.

474
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:50,980
Thank you.

475
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:53,320
But it's too much for two people.

476
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,020
Don't worry about that.

477
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,240
I see.

478
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,860
Then I'll get in the way again.

479
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,160
Yes, I'll go.

480
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:08,880
Mrs. Aoki, I'm sorry to bother you.

481
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:10,180
See you later.

482
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:37,660
I betrayed my husband.

483
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,230
But I can still get him back.

484
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,030
I can get him back.

485
01:22:05,845 --> 01:22:07,530
Welcome back. You're early.

486
01:22:13,035 --> 01:22:18,410
I'm here again.
Your husband told me to come.

487
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:21,590
Please, don't get involved with us.

488
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,310
What are you talking about?

489
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,340
I know your personality.

490
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:32,090
Do you like your husband?

491
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,170
You like a hole in the ass.

492
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:45,870
Be honest.

493
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:46,871
Are you okay? I'm fine.

494
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,700
Take your time.

495
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:53,790


496
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:10,000
Tetsuki,

497
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,420
I'm going to cut your favorite butt hole.

498
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,750
Are you okay?

499
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:33,910
Are you okay?

500
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:35,770
Yes.

501
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:46,190
Let me see your face.

502
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:53,350
Don't look so sad.

503
01:23:53,351 --> 01:23:54,351
Look at your pretty face.

504
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:02,170
What's the smell of your butthole today?

505
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,660
Please look at me.

506
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,660
Hey, hey, Natsuki.

507
01:24:56,810 --> 01:25:10,110
Do you feel it? I feel good.

508
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:20,340
I can't hear you.

509
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,130
I feel good.

510
01:25:35,165 --> 01:25:55,500
I want to put it in this hole soon.

511
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:16,080
I'm sorry.

512
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,180
I feel sick.

513
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,640
Say more.

514
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:35,780
I feel sick.

515
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:07,690
Do you want me to make you feel better?

516
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:09,350
Yes.

517
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:45,070
She is crying.

518
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,981
She is so
excited that her eyes are wide open.

519
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,150
What happened to
you? Stay still.

520
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:01,010
Show me your butt.

521
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,350
Yes, yes.

522
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,310
Show me, please.

523
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,760
It's smooth, isn't it?

524
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,240
Yes, it feels good.

525
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,120
I want to show this face to him.

526
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:39,300
I want to show you my face.

527
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:45,051
I want to show you
my face with a hole in my butt.

528
01:28:46,090 --> 01:29:14,600
I'm going to put it in deeper today.

529
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,801
OK, you can go to the back side.

530
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:36,940
OK, you can go to the back side.

531
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,180
OK, let's go.

532
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:48,220
This side, OK.

533
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:50,390
What?

534
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,741
Are you going to wash
my butt? OK, let's open.

535
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:59,420


536
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:01,980
It's time to open.

537
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:10,300
I feel sick.

538
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,330
I feel sick.

539
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:25,190
I feel sick.

540
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:51,410
You are a sloppy woman.

541
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,360
I'm sorry.

542
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,920
No, you are a sloppy woman.

543
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:01,470
Look at me.

544
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:07,000
I'm a sloppy woman.

545
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:09,800
I'm sorry.

546
01:31:09,801 --> 01:31:10,801
I'm sorry.

547
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:18,240
Let me feel good with this scar today.

548
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:19,940
Yes.

549
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,700
Who is the father?

550
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:34,750
Please put my scar in the father's scar.

551
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:37,730
That's right.

552
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:42,630
I'm sorry.

553
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,390
I'm going to stab you in the butt hole.

554
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:46,870
I'm sorry.

555
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:00,110
I'm going to stab you in the butt hole.

556
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:09,870
Come on.

557
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:19,510
I'm going to put you on my lap.

558
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:21,430
I'll put you on my lap.

559
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,530
I'm going to put you on my lap.

560
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,790
I'm going to put you on my lap.

561
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:41,670
OK.

562
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:43,370
Let's go.

563
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:45,610
I'm coming.

564
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,100
Natsuki.

565
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,580
Where are you? I'm going out.

566
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,040


567
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:56,940
Are you going out?

568
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,320
Yes.

569
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:01,830
Can I come in? Wait a minute.

570
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,560


571
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:05,610
Can I wait a minute?

572
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,370
Yes, wait a minute.

573
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:09,570
Still? Natsuki.

574
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:10,930
I'm ready.

575
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:15,410
Come in.

576
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:16,210
Are you ready?

577
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:16,850
Yes.

578
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:18,610
I'm home, Natsuki.

579
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:20,150
Welcome home.

580
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:22,550
You've been waiting for me.

581
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,600
You're so cute today.

582
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:27,660
I'm home, Natsuki.

583
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:29,250
Welcome home.

584
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:33,751
You're so cute today, Natsuki.

585
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,550
I missed you.

586
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:38,950
I missed you, too.

587
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,530
You are so aggressive.

588
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,786
I couldn't do it
yesterday because my senior came.

589
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,350
I'm trying to be patient.

590
01:33:51,351 --> 01:33:52,351
I'm sorry.

591
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:24,700
I feel sorry for you today.

592
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:29,860
Take this off, too.

593
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,820
This is the first
time I've ever seen a baby cry like this.

594
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:48,240
It's so cute.

595
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,340
It's so cute.

596
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,860
It's so cute.

597
01:35:11,725 --> 01:35:13,166
I was able to take off my underwear.

598
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:15,340
You didn't take off your underwear?

599
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:32,720
I didn't take off my underwear.

600
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,720
Manko, you are wet.

601
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:17,280
You are very wet.

602
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,800
It's getting hot.

603
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,160
It's hot.

604
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,220
It's hot, isn't it?

605
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:28,220
Yes.

606
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,300
You're sweating a lot.

607
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,540
I'm sweating?

608
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,780
Yes.

609
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:50,430
I'm sweating a lot.

610
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:53,050
It's because you worked hard.

611
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,730
I'm relieved.

612
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:02,590
I'm relieved.

613
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,411
You're feeling better, aren't you?

614
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:08,250
Put it in your mouth.

615
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:13,230
Put it in your mouth.

616
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:19,270
It's so good.

617
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:22,450
It feels good, doesn't it?

618
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:24,710
It feels good,
doesn't it? It's so good.

619
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:29,940
It feels good,
doesn't it? It's painful.

620
01:37:29,941 --> 01:37:30,941
It's painful.

621
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,320


622
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:50,120
Do you feel better?

623
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,320
Yes, I feel better.

624
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,100
You are strong.

625
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,070
You can do it.

626
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,760
Ah, it feels good.

627
01:38:44,355 --> 01:38:47,510
Natsuki, you're more aggressive than usual.

628
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,420
It feels good.

629
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:41,060
It feels good, Natsuki.

630
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,640
Put your head on my lap.

631
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,840
And lean back a little.

632
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:04,880
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

633
01:41:04,881 --> 01:41:05,881
It feels good.

634
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,400
I'm getting cold.

635
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:21,160
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

636
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,550
I'm getting cold.

637
01:41:26,551 --> 01:41:27,551
It's hot.

638
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:35,510
It's hot.

639
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:06,610
Please wait a while until I wake up!

640
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,270
Gosh… Please wait, Yaejin.

641
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:21,030
Go! Go home, go home!

642
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,410
Wait a while, please! It's hot.

643
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:59,680
It's hot.

644
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,320
It's hot.

645
01:43:02,321 --> 01:43:18,600
I want you to lie on top of me.

646
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:43,950
It feels good.

647
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,690
I'm so happy.

648
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:54,250
I love you.

649
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:59,510
I love you so much.

650
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:13,340
I love you.

651
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:14,640
It's hot.

652
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,660
But I heard that
your wife has a strong determination.

653
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:25,980
Senpai!

654
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:26,880
I'll put it in for you.

655
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,120
Senpai, what
are you doing? Stay still.

656
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,480


657
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,620
What are you doing?

658
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,260
Senpai! It's in.

659
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:36,840


660
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,260
It's a good body.

661
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:41,820
How is it?

662
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:45,040
It's a good thing that
both of your legs are in.

663
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,700
It's sour.

664
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,180
You should move too.

665
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:52,850
Stop it.

666
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,510
I'm sorry.

667
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:35,800
What's wrong?
You look like you're in a bad mood.

668
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,720
No, I'm not.

669
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,320
You two look like perverts.

670
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:53,060
How do you feel? I feel bad.

671
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:56,300
You are a baby.

672
01:46:05,195 --> 01:46:06,680


673
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:09,260
Which one do you feel bad? Both.

674
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:12,850


675
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:14,870
You are a pervert.

676
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,180
Both.

677
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,020
I feel bad.

678
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:39,710
Ken and Marco, what's wrong with you?

679
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,410
I'm going to go.

680
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:45,750
Are you going
alone? I feel sick.

681
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:48,430


682
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:50,590
What's wrong? I'm sick, too.

683
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:53,230
Then do it.

684
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:56,631
You're doing it again.

685
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:00,030
It's so itchy.

686
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,250
Go.

687
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,510
It's so itchy.

688
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:23,470
Hey, hey, hey.

689
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,981
You two are a couple after all.

690
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:28,410
You're getting into a fight.

691
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,570
Hey, get out of here.

692
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,640
I'll show you that this
woman is really a pervert.

693
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:44,260
I developed this anal.

694
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:52,630
Don't complain. It's all her fault.

695
01:47:59,495 --> 01:48:01,090
Listen carefully.

696
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:07,430
You are a woman
who feels pain in the buttocks, aren't you?

697
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:09,990
Look at her face.

698
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:16,290
I am a woman who feels pain in the
buttocks, aren't I?

699
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:19,810
I am a woman who feels pain in the
buttocks, aren't I?

700
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:22,550
Do you understand now?

701
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:26,850
Do you understand
that you are a terrible woman?

702
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:27,851
Did you get it?

703
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:28,930
Ouch!

704
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:32,550
I've put it in your ass many times.

705
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:34,550
I'll do it again today.

706
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:37,690
Look at me.

707
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:41,790
Ouch! It's hot.

708
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,500


709
01:49:36,520 --> 01:50:13,780
From that incident,

710
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,920
the dinner never gets cold.

711
01:50:17,895 --> 01:50:18,895
However,

712
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,900
the relationship with Shunji

713
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:22,540
is getting cold.
