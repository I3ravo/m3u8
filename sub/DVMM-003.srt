Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Mubappé, Neymar.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
Play safe, play safe, Le Yu reminding
you, under 18, please do not watch.

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,640
Little brother, do you want
to chat with your sister?

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
Sister, I'm a little lonely tonight.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,800
Come to Taiwan and chat with your sister.

6
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,161
Let's talk about the sky together.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,360
There are many lonely
sisters here at night.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
You can talk about anything
you want to each other.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,720
Let's talk about the
sky with a voice video.

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,740
You can do whatever you want to do.

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,400
If you dare to make a
video, I dare to take a video.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,780
There are 90,000 young
women in the country in Taiwan.

13
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,868
There are many types of Yuyu,
Lamei, Yujie, Loli, Heisei, and

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
Xueshoumei in Taiwan, and you
can always use the type you like.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,988
There are secret registration
services in different cities around

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,700
the country, so maybe we can make
an appointment in the same place.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,180
No one knows anyone here, sincere
friendship, not involved in friendship.

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,548
Taiwan Yuyu provides
privacy protection, so

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,340
you don't have to worry
about privacy leaks.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,900
There are also many good gifts to
be sent to these registration platforms.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm going to show you
the inside of the room.

22
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,300
It's amazing.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Is it like this?

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,460
Can you see it?

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes, I can.

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,920
It's so big that I can't get in.

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,780
How far can you get in?

28
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:21,260
Hey!

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,730
Thank you for coming all the way here.

30
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,731
You're welcome.

31
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:32,766
I heard you applied on our website.

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,270
That's right.

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,970
Could you introduce yourself first?

34
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,650
My name is Kenta.

35
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,950
I'm 27 years old.

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,250
Do you have a job?

37
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,356
If I don't use the umbrella too much.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,981
I'm a salaried man and I run a business.

39
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,210
I see.

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,270
Is the color of your hair okay?

41
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,630
It's barely safe.

42
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,670
I've heard that there's
a special reason for that.

43
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,030
I guess it's a special reason.

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,470
I've always had a desire to
be popular on the Internet.

45
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:11,070
I'd like to see a scene where a black
person gets beat up by a tall person.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,230
That's a lot of requests.

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,310
It's boring if you're Japanese.

48
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,311
I see.

49
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,450
So you are married, right?

50
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,030
Yes, I am.

51
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,790
How long have you been married?

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,690
It's been 3 years.

53
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,990
Is it still hot?

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,230
Well, we go out and take pictures together.

55
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,910
I don't know if I can ask you,
but how is your marital life?

56
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,911
What do you think?

57
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,910
I don't think I've done it yet.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
It's not enough.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,030
It's about to be my third year,
so I'd like to have an accent.

60
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,210
By the way, do you have
any experience in bed?

61
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,390
No, I don't.

62
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,270
I think it's the first
time for a black man.

63
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,030
Why?

64
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,550
You're flying today.

65
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,470
By the way, can I have
a look at your photos?

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,090
Sure.

67
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,211
I'm personally interested in them.

68
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,590
Can I take a selfie of you?

69
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,130
Is that allowed?

70
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,350
Selfie?

71
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,941
People send me photos of their clothes.

72
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,670
Cute.

73
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,190
Can I look at other photos?

74
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,210
Sure.

75
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,250
If you do it like this, it's okay.

76
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:43,330
It's like a different
pattern of the same selfie.

77
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,390
What's this?

78
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,750
It's a couple's thing.

79
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,230
I see.

80
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,150
By the way, is it possible
to set up a camera at home?

81
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,570
At home?

82
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,210
At home, it's a little...

83
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,710
It's an apartment.

84
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,110
It's a little... That's right.

85
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,210
That's not good.

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,361
There's a hotel we're staying at.

87
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,050
We can film there.

88
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:15,970
I'll set up the camera.

89
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,390
I'll give you the camera.

90
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,570
You'll film yourself?

91
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,390
Yes, I'll cover my eyes.

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,810
The black guy will be on standby.

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,330
So you'll cover your
eyes and take the camera?

94
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,450
Yes.

95
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,770
I see.

96
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,990
That's a problem.

97
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,330
I understand.

98
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,850
I'd like to contact you in detail.

99
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:37,050
I have a question for you.

100
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,370
Is it okay if I use your company's
phone number and email address?

101
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,470
No problem.

102
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,630
I'm going to have a
meeting with a foreigner.

103
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,910
I'm going to have a
meeting with a foreigner.

104
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,430
Thank you very much for today.

105
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,610
Thank you very much.

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,580
It's amazing.

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,840
It's spacious.

108
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,860
It's amazing.

109
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:11,320
It's a nice place.

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,761
There's a lot of space in the back.

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Isn't it spacious?

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,800
It's a Japanese-style room.

113
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,760
It's a Japanese-style room.

114
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
Let's get in.

115
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,050
It's so spacious in the back.

116
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:37,491
I didn't think it would be this big.

117
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,910
Let's take a break.

118
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,290
I'm tired.

119
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,510
It's a good time to
celebrate the anniversary.

120
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,170
That's right.

121
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,910
Is it the third year?

122
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,110
You remember it.

123
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,190
I remember it, too.

124
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,130
I remember it, too.

125
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,690
It's been a long time.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,810
It's been three years.

127
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,811
You are so fast.

128
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,310
You got a job at the same company.

129
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,770
Yes, I got a job at the same company.

130
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,871
How many years have you been dating?

131
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,241
How many years have I been dating?

132
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,550
Half a year.

133
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,026
How long have you been married?

134
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,050
2 years.

135
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,870
You remember it well.

136
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,910
I remember it well.

137
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,590
I miss working with you.

138
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,090
I feel nostalgic.

139
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,890
I was a little annoying senpai.

140
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,770
You were.

141
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,230
What are you doing now?

142
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,750
I was sent to another place.

143
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:51,950
Really?

144
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,410
Yes.

145
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,090
I didn't know.

146
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,170
There was something.

147
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,970
There was something like a crime.

148
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,350
That's right.

149
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,650
That's a little... I'm glad.

150
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,410
I'm glad I met you.

151
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:09,396
If it wasn't for that senior, I
wouldn't have had a bad relationship.

152
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,570
And then I got married.

153
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,150
Surprised?

154
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:14,950
Surprised?

155
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,210
Surprised.

156
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,066
Did you have a marriage proposal?

157
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,870
Well, as long as there was a good person.

158
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,470
I see.

159
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,590
How was it?

160
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,490
I already had it.

161
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,150
Did you have it?

162
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,530
Yeah.

163
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

164
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,530
Yes. I think I got married
at the same age as my ideal.

165
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
I think so, too.

166
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,070
It was 3 years ago, so I
was about 25 years old.

167
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:44,870
24 years old.

168
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,490
Isn't it ideal?

169
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,570
I thought that was good.

170
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,430
I was ideal.

171
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,970
I wanted to get married
when I was about 25 years old.

172
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:53,971
That's what I thought.

173
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,805
You came here on your 27th birthday.

174
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,410
It's been a while since I came here.

175
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,210
I'm looking forward to the hot spring.

176
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,090
I heard it's nice here.

177
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,190
Is that so?

178
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,290
I want to go in.

179
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,730
Let's go in.

180
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,510
Let's go in.

181
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,130
Let's take a bath.

182
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,131
Let's take a bath.

183
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,590
Let's take a bath.

184
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:39,810
It smells good.

185
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:44,210
It's a little cold, but it's pretty cold.

186
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,490
It's still cold.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,870
But it's still cold.

188
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,580
I'm sure you're nervous.

189
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,060
I'm not nervous.

190
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
More?

191
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,460
More.

192
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,240
I've only been to the Shinkansen once.

193
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,420
That's right.

194
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,421
Yes, that's right.

195
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
We didn't have time to
get along with each other.

196
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
That's right.

197
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
I was busy with work.

198
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,560
It felt good.

199
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Yes.

200
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,240
Do you feel relaxed?

201
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,940
Yes, I feel relaxed.

202
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
I feel relaxed.

203
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
That's right.

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I feel relaxed.

205
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,060
I feel relaxed.

206
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,061
I'm glad to hear that.

207
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,140
You're a sexy shot.

208
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,120
Do you want to have a child soon?

209
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,820
I want to have a child.

210
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Do you like children?

211
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
My child is cute.

212
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
I agree.

213
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,720
What do you want?

214
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,560
I want two children.

215
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,340
Do you want a boy or a girl?

216
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,341
Which one do you prefer?

217
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
I don't care.

218
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
You don't care?

219
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,260
I don't care.

220
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,920
I like them both.

221
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
If I'm alone,

222
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,320
I might want siblings.

223
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,780
You might be lonely.

224
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
I might be lonely.

225
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,260
If we're alone, we can hang out together.

226
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:20,940
That's right.

227
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Is that okay?

228
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,059
I don't know if it's a good
thing or a bad thing, but

229
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:41,891
I think it's a good thing to
have a son or a daughter.

230
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,300
I like the countryside.

231
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,800
It's relaxing.

232
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,150
It's far from the hustle
and bustle of the city.

233
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,160
I like the sea.

234
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,920
I like the sea, too.

235
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I can see the sea.

236
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,640
Do your best.

237
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Do your best.

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Do your best.

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,480
I'll do my best.

240
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,580
I heard you use sake.

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,420
Yes.

242
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,260
Japanese sake?

243
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,440
Yes.

244
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
What do you think?

245
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,140
Yes.

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,520
Let's make a toast to the 3rd anniversary.

247
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:24,980
Cheers?

248
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,560
Is it in?

249
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,400
Thank you.

250
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,680
Please follow me.

251
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Go ahead.

252
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,500
I'm going to get drunk.

253
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,740
It's okay.

254
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
It's just a tip.

255
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Wow.

256
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
It's hot.

257
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,320
It's hot.

258
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
It's hot.

259
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
It's hot.

260
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:47,160
That's how warm it is.

261
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,056
You don't usually drink, do you?

262
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,380
No, I don't.

263
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:52,640
I don't drink at home.

264
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,120
I'm not good at drinking anymore.

265
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
You don't drink, do you?

266
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
No.

267
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,080
Are you tired?

268
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,780
No, I'm not.

269
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,855
But it was a good time.

270
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,320
I was healed.

271
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I'm glad.

272
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Where should we go?

273
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,780
Do you want to go for a walk?

274
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,220
Do you want to go for a walk?

275
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,440
I wonder if there is a tourist attraction.

276
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,676
I wonder if there is a tourist attraction.

277
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,980
I heard that monkeys are famous.

278
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,780
Are you going to see monkeys?

279
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,940
I have never seen a monkey.

280
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,240
Be careful not to be caught.

281
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm scared.

282
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,340
I'm tired, so I'll massage you.

283
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,160
Are you serious?

284
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,580
What's up?

285
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,860
I wear the same clothes every day.

286
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,980
Do you have a boyfriend?

287
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I want to meet him.

288
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Do you want to meet him?

289
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Is it here?

290
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,340
How is it?

291
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,820
How do you feel?

292
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,360
I feel good.

293
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,440
Wow, it's sticking out.

294
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,660
Around here?

295
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,400
It's thin.

296
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,120
What are you talking about?

297
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
It's thin.

298
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,240
Is it?

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like a stone.

300
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
A stone?

301
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,900
It doesn't go as far as a stone.

302
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,760
I wonder what it is.

303
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,860
It's like a gori.

304
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,520
It's like Gori Gori.

305
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,480
It feels good.

306
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll give you back.

307
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,400
Really?

308
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Sleep.

309
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,020
Do you want me to crush it?

310
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,261
I'm going to massage your face.

311
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
What?

312
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,896
I saw a video on TV the other day.

313
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,880
What is it?

314
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,010
If you massage your face while covering
your eyes, it will be very effective.

315
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,700
Really?

316
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
Do you want to try it?

317
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,840
I don't know.

318
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
I'm tired.

319
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,120
I have it.

320
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,180
Do you have it?

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
I was thinking of giving you a massage.

322
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,500
Is that so?

323
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:27,501
It's a coincidence.

324
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,180
Where is it?

325
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:41,705
Did you forget?

326
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,480
No, I still have it.

327
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,740
It's a mess.

328
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,280
What is it?

329
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
I don't know what it is.

330
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,070
I found it.

331
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,010
I put it next to me.

332
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,830
Please put this on.

333
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,090
Can you put this on?

334
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,830
Is it like this?

335
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,650
That's good.

336
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,370
Can't you see it?

337
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,730
I can't see it at all.

338
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,950
You can't see it at all.

339
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:22,951
I can't see anything.

340
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,730
Then...

341
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,790
Wait a minute.

342
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,570
I'll give you a finger massage.

343
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,550
Really?

344
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,530
I don't need it.

345
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,550
I don't need it.

346
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,790
I can't see anything.

347
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,870
I can't see anything.

348
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,770
Really?

349
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,150
I can't see anything.

350
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,710
I can't see anything.

351
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,210
I can't see anything.

352
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,550
Wait a minute.

353
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Can't you see it?

354
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,430
Can't you see it?

356
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,550
I'll put my hand in front of the massage.

357
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,570
I don't need it.

358
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,850
Can't you see it?

359
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Okay.

360
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
First, the shoulder.

361
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,270
It feels good.

362
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,170
It's stiff, isn't it?

363
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,830
It's really stiff.

364
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,530
Let's do the other side.

365
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,490
It feels really good.

366
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,650
Does it feel good?

367
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,790
It feels good.

368
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,190
It feels good.

369
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,740
Let's massage the lower part as well.

370
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,070
It's hard, isn't it?

371
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,310
It's soft.

372
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,471
You look younger than before.

373
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,210
Really?

374
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
The other side.

375
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,490
I can't see anything.

376
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,090
I feel something strange.

377
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,610
What do you feel?

378
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,110
I don't know.

379
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,450
I feel something strange
when my vision is taken away.

380
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,530
Is it different from usual?

381
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,710
Yes, it is.

382
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,380
What's wrong with you?

383
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,381
I'm getting angry.

384
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,600
How about a massage?

385
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,660
I'll leave it as it is.

386
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
What?

387
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I'll leave it as it is.

388
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,600
As it is?

389
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,601
Oh, really?

390
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,860
You're good at it.

391
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,260
You've always wanted
to do that, haven't you?

392
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,340
Well, I guess so.

393
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,220
Can I play hide-and-seek with you?

394
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,440
What?

395
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,390
Can I play hide-and-seek with you?

396
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Are you interested in me?

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

398
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,120
I don't know.

399
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
You don't know?

400
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,030
You are excited.

401
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm always different.

402
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,940
Because you are different from usual.

403
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,020
This is the end.

404
00:20:47,930 --> 00:21:00,950
Is that dangerous?

405
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,850
It is dangerous.

406
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,590
Well, both are a bit of a foul.

407
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:25,340
You're more sensitive than usual.

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,360
What?

409
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:37,370
Your legs are shaking.

410
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,590
It's difficult.

411
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Does it feel good?

412
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,280
It feels good.

413
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
It tickles.

414
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,180
It feels good.

415
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,340
Okay, roll over.

416
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,060
Okay, roll over.

417
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,060
Stretch your legs.

418
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Huh?

419
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
What?

420
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,980
What's wrong?

421
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,140
I forgot this.

422
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
You forgot?

423
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,940
I didn't think you were a no-brainer.

424
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,670
Let's do a special course.

425
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,110
Special course?

426
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,790
I'm sleepy.

427
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:34,990
How do you feel?

428
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,570
I'm sleepy.

429
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,570
What's wrong?

430
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,730
I feel sick.

431
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,330
What's wrong?

432
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,010
I feel sick.

433
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,650
Open your legs by yourself.

434
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,990
You're so cute.

435
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,286
Do you want me to pet your face?

436
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Yes, please.

437
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,300
It feels good.

438
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
It's good, isn't it?

439
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,030
Oh, oh, oh.

440
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,900
Oh, oh, oh.

441
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,630
Oh, it feels good!

442
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,520
Oh, oh, oh.

443
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,840
Oh, it looks painful.

444
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,340
Oh, oh, oh.

445
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,360
Oh, it feels good!

446
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:52,430
I'm so happy.

447
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:53,431
It feels good.

448
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,950
Good morning.

449
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,870
You look like a four-leaf clover.

450
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,930
Your butt is like a four-leaf clover.

451
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,430
Turn your face to the right.

452
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,150
Oh, it's cute.

453
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,750
It's a little embarrassing.

454
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,870
Yes.

455
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,150
I don't want to see it.

456
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,630
I'll massage your butt.

457
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,450
What's that?

458
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:42,450
Hehehehe.

459
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:09,550
He's sensitive there.

460
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,510
How do you feel now?

461
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,550
I don't know How do I feel?

462
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,410
I'm a little nervous.

463
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,870
Hehehe

464
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:30,390
I can't see it.

465
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,070
It feels good.

466
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,610
Can I take it off?

467
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,790
No way.

468
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,850
I can't help it.

469
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,090
What is it?

470
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,570
I don't know what you're fishing.

471
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,510
It's a normal fish.

472
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,730
Oh, is it?

473
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:16,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

474
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,910
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

475
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:20,650
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

476
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:24,470
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

477
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,490
You are getting more and more messy...

478
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,630
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

479
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,670
Moles grow so easily?

480
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,170
Yes.

481
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,410
Oh, oh... Oh, my...

482
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,520
It feels so good.

483
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,360
Ah...

484
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,680
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

485
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:50,920
Ah, it feels so good.

486
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,200
It's good, isn't it?

487
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,450
It's so good.

488
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:19,000
It feels good.

489
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:40,860
I want you to feel good, too.

490
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,020
I don't know where it is.

491
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Let's go this way.

492
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,390
This way?

493
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,330
Here?

494
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,080
Here?

495
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,020
Why are you laughing?

496
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,530
There it is.

497
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,940
There it is.

498
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,060
Here?

499
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,740
Good.

500
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
What's wrong?

501
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,920
Was it this big?

502
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,400
You are more excited than usual.

503
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
It's heavy.

504
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,400
It's 30% bigger than usual.

505
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,810
The atmosphere?

506
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Yes.

507
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Hmm.

508
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,530
How does it feel to lick
while hiding your eyes?

509
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,950
What?

510
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,746
I felt so good that I almost said it.

511
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,770
Why?

512
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,830
Yuin, let's do it again.

513
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Until when did you do it?

514
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,620
You're amazing, I'm
going to sleep a little more.

515
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,100
Yes, you sleep by yourself.

516
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

517
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,900
Wait, it's amazing.

518
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,660
It's amazing.

519
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Isn't it big?

520
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,620
It's about 1.5 times this time.

521
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
It's big.

522
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,220
Wait a minute!

523
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:25,221
Wait a minute!

524
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,676
You're drooling more than usual.

525
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
I'm drooling.

526
00:32:50,870 --> 00:33:05,270
It doesn't fit in my mouth.

527
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,770
How far can you put it in your mouth?

528
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,350
What are you talking about?

529
00:33:21,170 --> 00:34:07,850
Show me your tongue.

530
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,630
Like this?

531
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,650
You are so cute.

532
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,550
You are so cute.

533
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,870
Really?

534
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,280
Can you give me a kiss?

535
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,420
I have a heart, too.

536
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,950
Wait a minute.

537
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,350
I'm glad you're here.

538
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,590
I'm going to sit here.

539
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,250
Give me a kiss.

540
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,710
Are you cute?

541
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,510
I'm so nervous.

542
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,120
Is he playing with me?

543
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,120
I don't know.

544
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,800
He is playing with me.

545
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
He is playing with me.

546
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,470
Can I stand up?

547
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,830
Can I stand up?

548
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:04,370
I think I should raise
my legs a little more.

549
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:16,500
I've never done this
before, so I'm a little nervous.

550
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,300
I'm a little nervous.

551
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,540
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

552
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,420
It's going well.

553
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:22,421
How do you feel?

554
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,140
It feels so good.

555
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,800
Let me brush your teeth.

556
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,120
Are you used to it?

557
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:57,121
Are you ready?

558
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:14,310
Why are you making a weird sound?

559
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,850
I don't know.

560
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,586
If you keep doing that, I
won't be able to bear it.

561
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,170
What?

562
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:45,110
No, you can't.

563
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,810
What?

564
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:46,070
No, you can't.

565
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:46,510
Wait a minute.

566
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,150
Can you go upstairs?

567
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,790
Upstairs?

568
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,110
Upstairs.

569
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,770
Here.

570
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,770
It's here.

571
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,150
Here?

572
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
What's wrong?

573
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
My heart is pounding.

574
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
What's wrong?

575
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,040
I'm more excited than usual.

576
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,041
I think she likes it.

577
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,580
You are always mean.

578
00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:46,520
It feels good.

579
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,380
It feels good.

580
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,700
Oh, it's not good.

581
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,580
She said she was going to go.

582
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:27,320
It feels good!

583
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,140
Does it feel so good?

584
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,000
Is that so?

585
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,940
I feel like I'll be a father soon, yes.

586
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:35,941
Really?

587
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,100
Can you stand there for a second.

588
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,700
Okay.

589
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,440
Wait a minute.

590
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:41,700
I was about to go.

591
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,850
I'm going to sleep.

592
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,620
Here?

593
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,271
I want you to move your hips.

594
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,000
Like this?

595
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,700
That's good.

596
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:01,160
It's good.

597
00:40:18,820 --> 00:41:21,550
It feels good.

598
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,060
Let's wash your hands.

599
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Hold this.

600
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,260
Open your legs.

601
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
That's right.

602
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,230
Oh, my back hurts.

603
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,330
Oh, it feels good.

604
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:30,950
Oh, it feels good.

605
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,190
Oh, my back hurts.

606
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,250
Oh, it feels good.

607
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:52,470
I love you so much!

608
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:53,471
I feel so good.

609
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:06,880
I got a voice mail.

610
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,960
I feel so good.

611
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,370
I love you so much!

612
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,610
Who are you?

613
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,090
Why are you taking a video of me?

614
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,910
Wait, I can't.

615
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,130
Wait a minute.

616
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,620
Wait a minute.

617
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Wait a minute.

618
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,220
Did you feel good?

619
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,990
I felt good.

620
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,060
Who are you?

621
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:01,940
We are friends, aren't we?

622
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:11,230
I love you, Ken-CHAN!

623
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,490
Hello!

624
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,370
Who are you?

625
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,730
Why are you taking a video of me?

626
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,650
Wait! I can't take a video of you!

627
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,130
Wait!

628
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,556
It feels good, doesn't it?

629
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,580
Yes, it does.

630
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,780
Who is she?

631
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
She is my friend.

632
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,540
Wait a minute.

633
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,780
Do you have a friend like her?

634
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,460
Yes, I do.

635
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,440
She was my friend when
I was studying abroad.

636
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,720
Are you kidding me?

637
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,401
I thought you were Ken-chan.

638
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,220
At first, I was Ken-chan.

639
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:09,900
At first?

640
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:10,580
The first one?

641
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,740
Yeah, the first one.

642
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,540
After that, it was him.

643
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,580
Him?

644
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,960
That's crazy.

645
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,520
That's amazing.

646
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,700
I won.

647
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,640
She's feeling good.

648
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Feeling good? Oh, nice.

649
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,820
Yay!

650
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Me too.

651
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,920
I think he can do it again.

652
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:36,400
Can you do it again?

653
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:39,100
Are you looking at me?

654
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,820
I'm looking at the camera.

655
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,940
It's a little embarrassing.

656
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
Can I do it?

657
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,280
Yes, you can.

658
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,871
Why are you looking at me?

659
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:36,720
It feels so good!

660
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Let's go!

661
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,310
It feels so good!

662
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,410
Oh my god!

663
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:13,850
It feels so good!

664
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,130
What?

665
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,370
It feels so good!

666
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,600
I'm so happy.

667
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:36,140
I'm so happy.

668
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,980
I'm so happy.

669
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,100
Ah~~~~illy~~~~.

670
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:26,721
It hurts... It hurts...!

671
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,380
Oh, you're drooling a lot.

672
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,530
How do you feel?

673
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,650
It feels good.

674
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,090
Do you want to do it again?

675
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,190
Can I do it again?

676
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:08,750
Yes.

677
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,370
Now, turn your hips and do it again.

678
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,140
Lay down.

679
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,400
I'm sorry.

680
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:30,890
I've never seen you so fast.

681
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,150
You're amazing.

682
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,640
Stop it!

683
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,620
Hey!

684
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:40,150
Hey!

685
00:52:40,151 --> 00:52:40,230
Open your eyes!

686
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:41,231
See, I'veollowed her.

687
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:52,610
It was bad, good for you.

688
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,451
selfish Let's go go go go.

689
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,770
You have to do it.

690
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:00,811
This is a very good sound.

691
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,910
Ah, I'm going to fall.

692
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:25,090
I'm going to fall.

693
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:32,060
It's in, it's in.

694
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,590
Oh no.

695
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:34,320
I'm going, I'm going.

696
00:54:35,660 --> 00:55:31,580
I'm going to fall, I'm going to fall.

697
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,540
Arigatou gozaimasu.

698
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,160
Arigatou gozaimasu.

699
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,960
What?

700
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,440
How was it?

701
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,940
What do you mean?

702
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,280
What do you mean?

703
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,540
I don't know what you mean.

704
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,080
I wanted to see you with a black man.

705
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,300
Are you really my friend?

706
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Yes.

707
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,580
I didn't know that.

708
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,940
I didn't know that.

709
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,100
I didn't know that.

710
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,060
I feel good.

711
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,320
You reacted better than I did.

712
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,620
I was surprised, too.

713
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,920
Did the person next to me hear it?

714
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,600
I heard her voice.

715
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:10,230
Thank you for coming today.

716
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,231
Thank you.

717
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:15,390
I heard that you applied on the website.

718
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,450
Yes.

719
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,720
I heard that you have
a special personality.

720
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:21,610
I don't know if it's special.

721
00:57:24,535 --> 00:57:27,470
I have a wife who has
been married for half a year.

722
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:33,430
I have a wife who is a bit older than
me, and I wanted to see her sleeping.

723
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,990
Have you had such an experience?

724
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:48,810
I've seen it in manga and doujinshi,
but it was my first time getting married.

725
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:56,449
I've been with my girlfriend
for a lifetime, but I can't keep

726
00:57:56,461 --> 00:58:01,850
up with her anymore, so I'm
looking for her on the website.

727
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,930
So you're looking for her all the time.

728
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:05,931
I see.

729
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:13,110
I don't have a big camera,
so I'm wondering what kind

730
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:18,830
of face I'll make when
I'm satisfied with the size.

731
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:22,050
I'm a little interested.

732
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:23,051
I see.

733
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,250
There is a hotel in this area.

734
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,710
I'll set up a camera there.

735
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,390
I'll take a video of you.

736
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,030
I'll cooperate with you.

737
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,650
Is it OK?

738
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,350
By the way,

739
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:43,410
should I contact the address
and phone number you sent me?

740
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,690
I see.

741
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,890
I'll contact you later.

742
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,490
I'll contact you about it.

743
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,610
I'll contact you about it.

744
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,611
I got it.

745
00:58:53,710 --> 00:59:00,570
I got it.

746
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:05,810
It's wide.

747
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:06,490
It's wide.

748
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,890
It's beautiful.

749
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,570
It's beautiful.

750
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:13,030
It's amazing.

751
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,150
I'll put a scissor here.

752
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:17,170
Are you okay?

753
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,050
I'm fine.

754
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,470
I'll put a lot of energy into it.

755
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,090
Thank you.

756
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,090
You are in a very good mood, aren't you?

757
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:29,410
I'm in a good mood, so I'm
going to take a break for a while.

758
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,310
I'm tired.

759
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,390
It was a little far, wasn't it?

760
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,250
No, but it was a good exercise.

761
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,560
I'm tired.

762
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,350
My legs hurt a lot.

763
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:44,190
I haven't seen you for a long time
I haven't seen you for a long time

764
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:48,230
It's been a long time since
we came to the onsen.

765
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,420
It's been a long time.

766
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,450
I'm sorry I've been busy all the time.

767
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,620
I haven't done anything.

768
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:01,790
I'm sorry I'm glad to be able to meet
you for the first time in a long time.

769
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:03,790
It's like a hot spring.

770
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,090
I'm looking forward to it

771
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,450
It's been a long time
since I had a day off.

772
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,650
That's right.

773
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,330
I'm looking for a job.

774
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,910
It's been 7 months since I got married.

775
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,810
That's right.

776
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:26,970
I'm always at home and
Kyoko is always outside.

777
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,210
I'm sorry.

778
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,750
why?

779
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:30,950
I've been alone all the time.

780
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:32,610
I can't go out to play.

781
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,610
I have a bad boss.

782
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:41,430
I have a lot of work to
do, so I'm sorry for that.

783
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,230
It's okay.

784
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,630
You'll be 30 years old soon.

785
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,010
That's right.

786
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,070
What should I do?

787
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:55,690
I don't think anything will change.

788
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,490
It won't change.

789
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,250
I've been the same since I turned 30.

790
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,990
It's been three years
since I was in my 20s.

791
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,530
On my birthday, I want to
go to the hot spring again.

792
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,390
I hope I can go.

793
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,910
How about having a baby?

794
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,940
That's right.

795
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,370
It's hard to have a baby when you're young.

796
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,830
It's better to have a
baby before you're born.

797
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:25,910
I don't know.

798
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,070
It's hard to have a baby
when you're pregnant.

799
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:31,530
I've never been pregnant, so I
don't know if it's going to be hard.

800
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,310
But I want you to get pregnant soon.

801
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,870
I've been thinking
about it for a long time.

802
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,810
Do you think so?

803
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:47,490
I think so, but when I'm at work, I
just go home, eat, and go to bed.

804
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:53,130
When I come to a place
like this, I sometimes say,

805
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,750
Let's do our best.

806
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,530
What?

807
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,830
Let's do our best sometimes.

808
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,850
Let's do our best sometimes.

809
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,870
My body is about to break.

810
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,150
Why?

811
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,350
I'm tired.

812
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,330
It's almost 10 o'clock overseas.

813
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,810
It's early in the morning.

814
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,490
Today,

815
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,990
let's use the hot spring slowly.

816
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:16,950
Let's eat delicious food.

817
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,650
Let's relax.

818
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,010
Let's do our best.

819
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:21,730
Yeah, it's relaxing.

820
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:23,510
Okay.

821
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,670
Let's do that.

822
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,150
It feels good.

823
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,870
Good, good.

824
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,310
The hot spring was the best.

825
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,330
It was really good.

826
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:39,950
It was really good.

827
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:40,750
It was like this.

828
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:41,310
It was great.

829
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:42,930
It was like this.

830
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:45,071
It's been a while since we went in slowly.

831
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:45,890
Yeah, we went in slowly.

832
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,290
There were no people at all.

833
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,530
Really?

834
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:49,330
Yeah.

835
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:50,070
I was so hungry.

836
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,010
That's great.

837
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,350
I saw a lot of them.

838
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,110
It can't be helped.

839
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:57,610
Women's baths are called long baths.

840
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,090
I think so.

841
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,390
I didn't go to many baths at home.

842
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:04,936
The size of the bath
is completely different.

843
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:05,450
I agree.

844
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:07,130
It's a big deal to have a bath at home.

845
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,250
It's a big deal.

846
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,730
I agree.

847
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,910
Because I was sitting there.

848
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:13,450
That's right.

849
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:14,451
I'm glad you like it.

850
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,910
I had a great meal.

851
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,750
It's been a while since I ate like that.

852
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,730
I see.

853
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,310
I always go home and
sleep with a full stomach.

854
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:26,890
I see.

855
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,390
I'm glad.

856
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,170
I drank beer after a long time.

857
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,630
I'm glad.

858
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,210
It was a good day.

859
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:37,870
I'm glad.

860
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,150
Can I hug you?

861
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,970
Will you stick to me?

862
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:41,610
What?

863
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,481
I'm not that kind of person.

864
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,730
Oh, really?

865
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,760
I'm sticking to you.

866
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,230
That's right.

867
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,350
Can I stick to you?

868
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,590
No.

869
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,050
I don't want to do that.

870
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:55,710
Hey.

871
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,470
Today is a special day.

872
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,130
It's a special day.

873
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,750
It's a good trip.

874
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:08,750
Kyouko-chan, can you
do something different?

875
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:10,790
What is it?

876
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,710
I want you to cover your eyes.

877
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,190
What? You want me to do that?

878
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:24,890
I heard from my co-worker that if you cover
your eyes, it will make you feel better.

879
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,250
Really?

880
01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:28,690
Really?

881
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,130
It's easier to get pregnant.

882
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,210
I don't know if it's true or not.

883
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,770
Is it physically effective?

884
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,810
It's physically effective.

885
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:40,790
Really?

886
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:41,970
Yes.

887
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:43,110
What do you think?

888
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,210
It's good.

889
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:45,730
Is it good?

890
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:46,230
Yes.

891
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:46,850
Really?

892
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,010
Yes.

893
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,850
I came to this place.

894
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:51,851
That's right.

895
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,270
I bought this at a 100
yen shop the other day.

896
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:58,610
What is this?

897
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,950
This is an eye mask.

898
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:01,550
Is this normal?

899
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,970
This is a normal eye mask.

900
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,210
This is on your head.

901
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,246
This is to prevent your
hair from crumbling.

902
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,471
Please hold this for a moment.

903
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,210
Really?

904
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,570
Please pull this.

905
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,910
Is this the correct way to do it?

906
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:15,550
This is wrong.

907
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,090
Please pull this.

908
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,010
This doesn't hurt, does it?

909
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,170
What do you think?

910
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:22,410
Is it weird?

911
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,190
No, it's not weird at all.

912
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:27,410
What is it?

913
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,490
It's just my hair.

914
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:30,830
What is it?

915
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,350
It's fixed.

916
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,990
I can't see anything.

917
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,330
Don't you feel pain?

918
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,230
I'm fine.

919
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:41,630
I can't see anything.

920
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,401
Even if you hide your eyes,

921
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,850
you're still cute.

922
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,270
That's amazing.

923
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:49,271
What's that?

924
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,321
Your skin is so beautiful.

925
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,230
I can't live without your eyes.

926
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,330
I'm not happy with that.

927
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:57,950
It's a new discovery.

928
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,250
I'm not happy with that.

929
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,770
It's a new discovery.

930
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,990
It's amazing.

931
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,200
I feel strange.

932
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,170
It's pitch black.

933
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:08,050
Is there a gap under your eyes?

934
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:09,790
I can't see anything.

935
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:13,510
It's pitch black here.

936
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,730
What is it?

937
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,530
Can you give me a hug?

938
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,150
What?

939
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,450
Where are you?

940
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:36,830
I'm here.

941
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:42,270
It's been a long time since I gave
you a hug It's been a long time.

942
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,370
Oh!

943
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:46,430
It's warm It's warm.

944
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:51,891
This is the best I
want to hug you.

945
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,790
Kissing is the best, isn't it?

946
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:55,810
That's right.

947
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,620
Let's kiss.

948
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:07,110
It's been a while.

949
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,111
It's your turn.

950
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,340
Wow, it feels good.

951
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:41,880
Does it feel good?

952
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,280
Yes.

953
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,500
I can't see anything.

954
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:47,821
But you're touching her shoulder.

955
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,040
Do you want to kiss her again?

956
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,440
Yes.

957
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,540
I'm going to give you a kiss I'm
going to give you a kiss on your boob.

958
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,440
Oh, it's so big.

959
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,580
You always touch it.

960
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:32,120
It's been a while
since I touched it, so it's

961
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:35,480
different Are you excited
because it's been a while?

962
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,740
I'm excited.

963
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,580
Do you want me to take it off?

964
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,320
Yes, please take off the string.

965
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,431
Oh, it's already out of the frame.

966
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,740
I took it off.

967
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,470
Oh, it's so beautiful.

968
01:08:58,525 --> 01:08:59,525
Your hands are cold.

969
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,250
A little more.

970
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:08,450
It's so soft.

971
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,690
It's so soft.

972
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:12,390
It's so soft.

973
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,871
Really? I've been holding it in.

974
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,650
Really?

975
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,130
It's heavy.

976
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,760
It's so soft.

977
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,090
It feels good.

978
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:38,740
Can I touch your neck?

979
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,840
I was surprised that Asa was surprised.

980
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:52,960
It feels good.

981
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Is it hot?

982
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,000
I wonder if there is Asa on the right side.

983
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,001
Let's see.

984
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,200
Wow, he is standing up

985
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:19,080
He is standing up

986
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,620
Do you want to be carried?

987
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:23,621
I don't want to.

988
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:33,800
Do you want me to throw it away?

989
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:36,860
No, I don't want to.

990
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,220
I don't feel good.

991
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,860
It's so hot!

992
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,130
It feels so good!

993
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,830
Your hair is so nice today, isn't it?

994
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:41,850
I've been taking care of my hair.

995
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,390
Oh, really?

996
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,820
It feels so good!

997
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,950
Ah!

998
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,560
Ah!

999
01:12:12,635 --> 01:12:13,635
You're sweating a lot.

1000
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,510
It feels good.

1001
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:17,150
Did you sweat?

1002
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,060
You're sweating a lot.

1003
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,510
You're sweating the most.

1004
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:23,990
Eh?

1005
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:29,090
Ah, it feels good.

1006
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,810
Ah!

1007
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,030
It feels good.

1008
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:47,490
Oh, no!

1009
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:54,380
Oh, no!

1010
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:55,620
Oh, no!

1011
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,621
Don't worry, I'm here.

1012
01:12:58,815 --> 01:13:00,980
Oh, no!

1013
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:06,040
Oh, no!

1014
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,770
Oh, no!

1015
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,350
Oh, no!

1016
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,030
Oh, no!

1017
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,850
Oh, no!

1018
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:25,851
It feels so good.

1019
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:26,590
Did you hold it in?

1020
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,090
Yes.

1021
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,380
It feels so good.

1022
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,360
It's really good, isn't it?

1023
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,460
Let's lie down, Kyoko-chan.

1024
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,260
Should I lie down?

1025
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,300
Yes.

1026
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,840
The pillow is over there.

1027
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,520
Is it here?

1028
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,960
Is it here?

1029
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,220
Yes.

1030
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,070
Thank you.

1031
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,360
Open your mouth.

1032
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,241
I'm going to touch your belly button.

1033
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,500
You are sleeping soundly.

1034
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,560
It's uncomfortable.

1035
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,640
How do you feel?

1036
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,660
It's uncomfortable.

1037
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,231
I'm going to touch your
neck and belly button.

1038
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,750
How do you feel?

1039
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,690
I'm going to cry.

1040
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,130
Are you going to cry?

1041
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,370
Ah!

1042
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:38,090
Ah!

1043
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,180
Oh, you're sweating a lot.

1044
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,290
Ah!

1045
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:40,710
Ah!

1046
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,910
It feels good!

1047
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:43,070
Ah!

1048
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,090
Ah!

1049
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,270
Is it hot?

1050
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:46,350
Ah!

1051
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:47,970
Ah!

1052
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,170
Ah!

1053
01:14:50,040 --> 01:15:17,950
It feels good!

1054
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,080
Wow!

1055
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,380
It's amazing!

1056
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,620
It's like I'm in a sauna.

1057
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,460
Ah!

1058
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:01,550
Oh no!

1059
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,050
This feels good!

1060
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,110
Ah!

1061
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:43,500
Ah!

1062
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,180
Oh, wow!

1063
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:44,780
Your back is floating.

1064
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:45,780
Ah!

1065
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:47,160
Ah, it feels good.

1066
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,380
Is it hot?

1067
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:49,780
It's hot.

1068
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,260
Your lower back must be hurting.

1069
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:53,770
Ah, it's hot.

1070
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:55,430
It's hot, isn't it?

1071
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,700
Ah, you're sweating.

1072
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,590
I want you to touch the surface again.

1073
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,941
I want you to touch the Chestnut.

1074
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,030
The Chestnut?

1075
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,410
Yes.

1076
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:12,790
I'll touch the Chestnut.

1077
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,170
Ah, it's hot.

1078
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,510
It's hot.

1079
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,510
Oh!

1080
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:21,330
Oh!

1081
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:22,331
Oh!

1082
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:27,790
Feels good!

1083
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,790
Oh!

1084
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,190
Oh!

1085
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,320
It feels good!

1086
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:39,800
Does it feel good?

1087
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:40,300
Oh!

1088
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,520
Is it a little wet?

1089
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,640
It's wet!

1090
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,080
Oh!

1091
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,160
Oh!

1092
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,720
Oh!

1093
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:48,780
Here?

1094
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:49,660
Oh!

1095
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,200
Oh!

1096
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,480
Here?

1097
01:17:52,481 --> 01:17:53,481
Oh!

1098
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:53,720
Oh!

1099
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,440
Oh!

1100
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:54,680
Oh!

1101
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:55,560
Oh!

1102
01:17:55,561 --> 01:17:55,780
Oh!

1103
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:56,440
Oh!

1104
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,220
Ah, it feels good.

1105
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,840
It's almost there.

1106
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,800
It's almost there.

1107
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,780
I love you.

1108
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,840
I'm going to go.

1109
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,040
Go.

1110
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,560
I'm going.

1111
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,440
Ouch!

1112
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,920
Ouch!

1113
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,440
Can you make me feel better?

1114
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,420
Sure.

1115
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:50,410
Can you do that?

1116
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,700
Yes.

1117
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,300
Ouch!

1118
01:18:55,455 --> 01:18:56,820
Where are you?

1119
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,260
I just hit you.

1120
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,890
I'm sorry.

1121
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,150
I'm sorry.

1122
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,810
You are better than usual.

1123
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,050
I'm sorry.

1124
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,630
I'm sorry.

1125
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,280
The ice cream is super hard.

1126
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:06,460
I'm excited.

1127
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,020
It's been a while, so it becomes hard.

1128
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,910
I want you to breath.

1129
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,060
Wait a minute.

1130
01:20:37,345 --> 01:20:38,720
I'll wait.

1131
01:20:38,721 --> 01:20:45,750
Can I take a picture of you?

1132
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:46,751
Yes, sure.

1133
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,790
This is me.

1134
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,250
What was I doing?

1135
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,130
I was on your left leg.

1136
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:04,730
Here?

1137
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,630
Yes, that's right.

1138
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,850
Here?

1139
01:21:07,851 --> 01:21:08,851
Let's do it again.

1140
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,750
Is it right?

1141
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,950
Yes, it is.

1142
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:36,670
Did you get better than before?

1143
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:40,910
Yes, I did.

1144
01:21:40,911 --> 01:21:42,170
I don't think so.

1145
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,950
I don't think so.

1146
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:45,870
I think it's because it's a trip.

1147
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,790
It's hot, so you're cold, right?

1148
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:57,330
Yes.

1149
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,130
I can't see it.

1150
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,290
It's very beautiful.

1151
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,890
My feet are itchy.

1152
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,630
It's okay.

1153
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,190
Yes, yes, yes.

1154
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:10,570
Keep going.

1155
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,650
Ah, it feels good.

1156
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,850
Ah, I like it.

1157
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,630
Ah, you're going all the way to the back.

1158
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,100
Oh, it's the biggest one I've ever seen.

1159
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,740
Oh, it feels good.

1160
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,510
Oh, it's amazing.

1161
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:06,730
Oh, it's very intense.

1162
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:08,930
Oh, wait a minute.

1163
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:36,670
Oh, it feels good.

1164
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:37,810
Oh, it feels good.

1165
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,480
It's getting really hard.

1166
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:44,130
I feel like I've gotten really big today.

1167
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,141
Can I have you pinch me with your boobs?

1168
01:23:53,165 --> 01:23:54,766
Can I have you pinch me with your boobs?

1169
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:55,980
Sure.

1170
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,460
Can I have you pinch me with your boobs?

1171
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:59,620
It's my turn.

1172
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,640
Hang in there.

1173
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:21,440
Wow, it's so hard.

1174
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,940
It's hard today.

1175
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,100
It's hard.

1176
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,420
Does it feel good?

1177
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,500
It feels so good.

1178
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:33,680
It's the best feeling I've ever had.

1179
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:34,880
Really?

1180
01:24:43,095 --> 01:24:44,490
Kyo-Kyo-Ko-Chan is so erotic.

1181
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:47,350
I'm getting excited.

1182
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:52,150
You are so cute.

1183
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,580
It's so hard.

1184
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:11,100
It's bigger than usual.

1185
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:12,580
Really?

1186
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:15,140
Maybe it's because your face is swollen.

1187
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:19,340
Why is my face swollen?

1188
01:25:21,335 --> 01:25:22,816
Because you are in a good mood today.

1189
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,220
What are you talking about?

1190
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,840
You are in a good mood.

1191
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,420
You are in a good mood.

1192
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,680
Oh, my God.

1193
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,280
Are you in a bad mood?

1194
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:38,880
What's wrong?

1195
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:41,260
Do you want me to put it in?

1196
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,260
Do you want me to put it in?

1197
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,680
Yes.

1198
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,160
I'll put it in.

1199
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,360
I'll put it in.

1200
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:50,560
I'll put it away from you.

1201
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,820
I'll put it in.

1202
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,460
Put it in.

1203
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,621
You might be able to have a baby.

1204
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,820
Please put it in.

1205
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:40,360
I feel so good.

1206
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,560
I feel so good.

1207
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:50,670
Oh, so slippery.

1208
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,650
You're so slippery.

1209
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:02,730
Oh, no.

1210
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:04,810
It's completely different
from when you were alive.

1211
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,650
Oh, no, dad.

1212
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:10,860
Can I squeeze your arm?

1213
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:11,990
Yes, please.

1214
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:16,230
Oh, it's so nice.

1215
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:18,490
I feel great.

1216
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,931
Don't you feel like you're getting bigger?

1217
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,950
I ate a lot of rice earlier.

1218
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,030
Did you eat food?

1219
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:26,270
Yes, I ate a lot of food.

1220
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:31,090
I feel like I'm getting bigger.

1221
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:36,910
I feel great.

1222
01:27:37,750 --> 01:28:13,570
I'm so happy.

1223
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:15,010
I'm so happy.

1224
01:28:15,011 --> 01:28:36,630
I'm so happy.

1225
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,550
I'm gonna come!

1226
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:40,310
I'm gonna come!

1227
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,570
I'm gonna come!

1228
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,140
Hi there.

1229
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,160
Nice to meet you.

1230
01:29:36,595 --> 01:29:37,595
My name is David.

1231
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,620
It's a pleasure.

1232
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,140
Hi there.

1233
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:53,670
Nice to meet you.

1234
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,080
My name is David.

1235
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,110
It's a pleasure.

1236
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,730
I'm not a suspicious person.

1237
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,540
Who are you?

1238
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:11,030
We used to go to a bar
together at the company's bar.

1239
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:15,630
We got along with each other.

1240
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:16,991
Did you get along with each other?

1241
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:19,670
You are a very good person.

1242
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:23,510
You are a very good person.

1243
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,700
what?

1244
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,550
You are a good person.

1245
01:30:29,551 --> 01:30:30,551
You're a good person.

1246
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:33,930
Don't be scared.

1247
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:44,670
Instead of that...

1248
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,990
What do you mean?

1249
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:49,050
What do you mean?

1250
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,290
On the website...
On the website?

1251
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:55,450
Why?

1252
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,681
There's someone who takes care of me.

1253
01:31:00,685 --> 01:31:01,685
I really like Kyoko-chan.

1254
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,290
I really like Kyoko-chan, but...

1255
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:06,266
I want to see Kyoko-chan
being taken care of.

1256
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,080
So I applied for it.

1257
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:13,410
Wait, wait, what do you mean?

1258
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,251
I really like Kyoko-chan, but... I want
to confirm my love for Kyoko-chan.

1259
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,721
I think I can like Kyoko-chan more.

1260
01:31:20,145 --> 01:31:24,160
I thought he was a nice guy.

1261
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,080
What?

1262
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,460
He was a really nice guy.

1263
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,680
He was really nice.

1264
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:31,391
If he wasn't, I wouldn't have asked you.

1265
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,240
Is that so?

1266
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,580
Yes, yes, yes.

1267
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:35,600
What?

1268
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,240
He was really nice, wasn't he?

1269
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:38,420
What?

1270
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:43,520
His reaction was totally
different from mine.

1271
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,050
I thought he was a nice guy.

1272
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,460
I was watching him.

1273
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,140
I was like, what?

1274
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:56,940
What?

1275
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,500
I'm so used to it.

1276
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,680
I think it was amazing.

1277
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,040
I was surprised.

1278
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:07,050
It was really good.

1279
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:08,820
A lot.

1280
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,060
It was a lot.

1281
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,640
In English.

1282
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:15,440
Now?

1283
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:15,940
Yes.

1284
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,300
I speak American.

1285
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,240
I'm sorry.

1286
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,241
I can't help but laugh.

1287
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,960
Thank you.

1288
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,180
When did you start?

1289
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:37,460
At first... I sat here and blindfolded
myself for about 30 seconds.

1290
01:32:38,915 --> 01:32:40,136
I can't count, so I don't know.

1291
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,160
Really?

1292
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,340
I had three fingers.

1293
01:32:44,341 --> 01:32:45,640
There were three of them.

1294
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,640
There were?

1295
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,080
There were three of them.

1296
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,460
Really?

1297
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,680
I don't know.

1298
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,460
I felt a little uncomfortable.

1299
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:58,920
There are no humans.

1300
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:03,500
But I don't think there
are three of them here.

1301
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,280
I don't think so.

1302
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,160
One more.

1303
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,080
What?

1304
01:33:09,081 --> 01:33:10,081
What is it?

1305
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,980
What is it?

1306
01:33:14,735 --> 01:33:15,735
Are you serious?

1307
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,940
Are you serious?

1308
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:33,350
Are you serious?

1309
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,530
Are you kidding me?

1310
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,400
I'm scared.

1311
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,220
Ah!

1312
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,040
How do you feel?

1313
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:29,240
It's so big!

1314
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,360
Ah...

1315
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:35,280
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

1316
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:07,430
Ah...

1317
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,620
It's so bad!

1318
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:19,380
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1319
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,531
I'm so tired I'm sleepy.

1320
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,640
Do you think you can do it?

1321
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,220
Yes.

1322
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:50,580
You think you can do it?

1323
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,320
I think you can do it.

1324
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:54,980
Oh.

1325
01:35:55,740 --> 01:36:03,700
Oh Oh Oh Oh my God.

1326
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,220
Oh no.

1327
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:09,221
Oh my God.

1328
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:14,401
oh my god let's look inside.

1329
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,160
did you find anything?

1330
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:38,441
wow, you have a lot
You can see a lot of blood.

1331
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,300
Foreigners have a lot of blood.

1332
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:47,660
She is very good.

1333
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:49,900
A lot of blood came out.

1334
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,820
How did you feel?

1335
01:37:00,765 --> 01:37:03,500
Your face is swollen.

1336
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,960
Can you move down a little?

1337
01:37:11,385 --> 01:37:12,680
Kiyoko, you're good at moving.

1338
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:26,530
Can I put it in?

1339
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:27,690
You can put it in.

1340
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:42,450
If you put it in from
below, it will go deeper.

1341
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,150
It's dangerous.

1342
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:45,870
It's dangerous? It looks dangerous.

1343
01:37:45,871 --> 01:37:46,050
That's right.

1344
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:47,590
That's great.

1345
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,200
That's great.

1346
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,420
You're breathing slowly.

1347
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,260
You're breathing so gently.

1348
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,720
No.

1349
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:07,470
Are you scared?

1350
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:14,050
She's trying to help you.

1351
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,160
She's helping you.

1352
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,600
Big!

1353
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,180
If you put it up, you can pick it up.

1354
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:54,390
You're picking it up a lot.

1355
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,750
Un...

1356
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:12,490
Water's in it a lot.

1357
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:15,650
Oh!

1358
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,250
Your favorite towel.

1359
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:25,211
Un... oh oh.

1360
01:39:43,135 --> 01:39:47,180
oh i'm gonna come to you.

1361
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,200
oh oh god.

1362
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,880
oh.

1363
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:54,940
oh.

1364
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:58,740
oh oh !

1365
01:39:58,741 --> 01:39:59,741
Ah!

1366
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:14,240
Now it's out... Mugyere is out.

1367
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,600
Oh, is it out again?

1368
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:20,051
How many times do you put it out?

1369
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:28,686
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.

1370
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:30,720
It's coming out a lot.

1371
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,060
It's coming out a lot.

1372
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,381
How many times has it come out?

1373
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,480
Oh no.

1374
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:42,680
It's coming out.

1375
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,700
It's okay.

1376
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:48,580
It's okay.

1377
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,700
It's okay.

1378
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,320
Great.

1379
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,900
Great.

1380
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:00,020
Thank you.

1381
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,180
Thank you.

1382
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:02,420
Thank you.

1383
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:03,421
Thank you.

1384
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,120
It's okay.

1385
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:08,420
I'm good. Very good.

1386
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:13,620
Thank you.

1387
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:15,860
Thank you.

1388
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:17,460
See you again.

1389
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,040
I'm not going home.

1390
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,460
Goodbye.

1391
01:41:20,461 --> 01:41:21,720
Bye-bye!

1392
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,280
Pyo-San, say bye-bye.

1393
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:25,840
Bye-bye!

1394
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:31,990
It was amazing.

1395
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:33,410
I was surprised.

1396
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:34,330
How was it?

1397
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:35,630
It wasn't surprising.

1398
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:37,070
Right?

1399
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:38,010
It was crazy!

1400
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:39,290
It was crazy!

1401
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:40,330
Wasn't it crazy?

1402
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:43,411
Crazy, crazy, crazy It came
out a lot It came out a lot.

1403
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,290
But it felt good, didn't it?

1404
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:46,590
Well, that's true.

1405
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:50,651
I'm glad I didn't know you
had such a desire I see.

1406
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:51,970
Yes, I think so.

1407
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:54,510
Really?

1408
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:58,230
So, I think I did a great job. Thank you.

1409
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,970
I'm glad that you're happy.

1410
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,980
I heard that you have a special talent.

1411
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:19,700
To be honest, I have a desire
to be popular on the Internet.

1412
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,000
I can't find such a person.

1413
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:30,700
I applied for this time because I saw the
website and I was able to sleep a little.

1414
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:34,980
Who do you want to sleep with?

1415
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:40,700
I'm a little embarrassed, but I'm a virgin.

1416
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,420
I have a small penis, so I would
be happy if I could have a big penis.

1417
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,960
I see.

1418
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,980
You have a wife, right?

1419
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:00,520
Yes, I do.

1420
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:01,900
Can I see your picture?

1421
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
Sure.

1422
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,060
I've been married for 6 years.

1423
01:43:08,061 --> 01:43:09,061
It's about a year old.

1424
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,220
Isn't it cute?

1425
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,120
I'm proud of it.

1426
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,800
Is this the one you took today?

1427
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,801
Are you going to send me a selfie?

1428
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:20,300
That's right.

1429
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,900
You're taking a lot of selfies.

1430
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:25,220
I see.

1431
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,560
You're taking a lot of selfies.

1432
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:30,420
I live a normal life on my days off.

1433
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:32,351
That's why I'm taking a lot of selfies.

1434
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:35,360
By the way, is it possible
to set up a camera at home?

1435
01:43:35,361 --> 01:43:36,780
Is it possible to rent a house?

1436
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,020
A house?

1437
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:41,060
A house is a little...

1438
01:43:41,385 --> 01:43:43,320
My mother-in-law lives there.

1439
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,840
Oh, your mother-in-law.

1440
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:46,120
That's right.

1441
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,220
I see.

1442
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:49,016
It may be a little
difficult to rent a house.

1443
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,900
You can't live without a house.

1444
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,240
That's right.

1445
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,800
I have a lot of things to do at home.

1446
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,140
I see.

1447
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:57,740
Then, there is a hotel that
we have prepared for you.

1448
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:02,260
Can you take a trip
there and bring it to us?

1449
01:44:02,261 --> 01:44:05,500
If you don't mind, I can give you
a place to stay for a cheap price.

1450
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:07,260
Is there such a place?

1451
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,920
I'll give you a place to stay.

1452
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,680
Really?

1453
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,400
I'll contact you later.

1454
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:20,300
I'd be happy if you could do it there.

1455
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,120
Is the address and phone number okay?

1456
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:29,220
No problem.

1457
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:30,221
I see.

1458
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,761
I'll let you know when
the details are decided.

1459
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:35,231
I'm looking forward to it.

1460
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,680
Thank you for today.

1461
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:37,100
You're welcome.

1462
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,560
Thank you very much.

1463
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:46,620
Please come in.

1464
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,960
It's very spacious.

1465
01:44:58,420 --> 01:44:59,780
It's spacious and beautiful.

1466
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:02,760
The room is big.

1467
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,720
It's nice.

1468
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:12,251
It's nice to have an atmosphere here.

1469
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,600
It's pretty big.

1470
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:16,941
This is enough for two people.

1471
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:26,880
I couldn't make a reservation at this inn.

1472
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,220
Is that so?

1473
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,200
I've met a senior at the company, Suzuki.

1474
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,340
I've met him a few times.

1475
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,040
He made a reservation for me.

1476
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:41,320
Oh, really? That's amazing.

1477
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:45,780
You told me that you can't
go on a vacation with me.

1478
01:45:47,195 --> 01:45:49,820
Oh, really? I should thank you.

1479
01:45:49,965 --> 01:45:52,640
It's been 6 years since you got married.

1480
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,000
Yes, it's been 6 years.

1481
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:55,780
Time flies.

1482
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,200
Yes, it does.

1483
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,600
We don't really travel much.

1484
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:02,260
Yes, we did only when we first got married.

1485
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:04,600
I was busy too.

1486
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,221
It's been a while since I've been here.

1487
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:09,800
It's nice.

1488
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,801
It reminds me of the old days.

1489
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,200
It's great.

1490
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:17,400
I usually go shopping, but I
haven't been to such a place.

1491
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,460
Me neither.

1492
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,560
I'm looking forward to it.

1493
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:28,340
I heard that there are
many hot Springs here.

1494
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:29,341
Really?

1495
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:32,100
I want to go to various hot Springs.

1496
01:46:32,101 --> 01:46:32,320
I want to take a rest.

1497
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,400
You always leave all the housework to me.

1498
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:39,101
I want you to take a rest.

1499
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,220
I want to take a rest.

1500
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:42,940
I know.

1501
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,060
But, if you have a baby,
you can't take a rest.

1502
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,640
I know.

1503
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,780
You can't take a rest.

1504
01:46:55,310 --> 01:46:57,900
What should I do if I have a baby?

1505
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,120
How many children do you want?

1506
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:06,880
Well, first of all, I want
to have one person.

1507
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,460
I think you'll get a job soon.

1508
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,020
I think you'll be able to
cooperate with your wife.

1509
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,740
How many people do you want?

1510
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,400
About three people.

1511
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,460
That many?

1512
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,120
That's a lot of work.

1513
01:47:30,121 --> 01:47:31,241
You don't know that, do you?

1514
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:32,640
I don't.

1515
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:34,460
But, you are cute, aren't you?

1516
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:38,160
I'm sure I'll be cute when I'm born.

1517
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:40,900
You are cute today, too.

1518
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:42,620
Thank you.

1519
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,480
You don't say that all the time.

1520
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,200
I don't.

1521
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,861
By the way, I heard that
the hair salon is spacious.

1522
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:51,580
Let's go inside.

1523
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:52,980
Let's go.

1524
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:57,340
My hair salon is very spacious.

1525
01:47:57,341 --> 01:47:58,341
It's wide!

1526
01:47:58,660 --> 01:47:59,840
It's quite wide, isn't it?

1527
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,800
It's really high.

1528
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:03,620
I didn't know it was this wide.

1529
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,720
It's said that it has a
skin-cleansing effect.

1530
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:09,380
This?

1531
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,240
I'm sure.

1532
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:11,680
It's even more refreshing.

1533
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:14,140
What is it?

1534
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,540
I've been thinking about dry skin lately.

1535
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:21,060
It's a white skin.

1536
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:23,140
I'm not used to it.

1537
01:48:33,445 --> 01:48:34,820
It's so hot.

1538
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:36,920
It's not my fault.

1539
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:38,700
It's your fault.

1540
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,300
It feels so good.

1541
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,020
Yeah, it feels good.

1542
01:48:46,485 --> 01:48:47,760
I'm glad we came here.

1543
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,400
I'm really glad.

1544
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:51,710
The bath was really good.

1545
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:52,960
Yeah, it was good.

1546
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,040
It was really warm.

1547
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,276
Yeah, it was good that it
was like a hot spring town.

1548
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,300
Yeah.

1549
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,720
I want to go to a place
like that again tomorrow.

1550
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:00,480
Yeah.

1551
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:01,420
Let's go together.

1552
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:01,980
Yeah.

1553
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,580
Where did you buy it?

1554
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,780
I don't know.

1555
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:08,940
I heard you can eat here, so I like it.

1556
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,300
What do they have here?

1557
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:19,460
I don't know what they have, but if I
ask a hotel staff, they might tell me.

1558
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,860
I see.

1559
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,240
Do they have ramen?

1560
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,540
I think so.

1561
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,020
I want to eat it.

1562
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,640
What flavor do you like?

1563
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:31,040
If there is a famous restaurant
here, I want to go there.

1564
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:32,041
I see.

1565
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:33,420
It's a local restaurant.

1566
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:35,060
It looks delicious.

1567
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:36,900
Let's go there tomorrow.

1568
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,400
The crab I ate earlier
was also very delicious.

1569
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,640
I'm glad.

1570
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,380
I don't eat crab.

1571
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,040
You don't eat crab.

1572
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,260
It's a high-grade food.

1573
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:51,180
Sashimi was also good.

1574
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:52,120
It was good.

1575
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,440
It was delicious.

1576
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,540
I ate too much.

1577
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:56,880
I'm glad I could come with you.

1578
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:59,020
Yeah, it's fun.

1579
01:50:02,995 --> 01:50:03,995
It's nice to be with you.

1580
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:07,780
I want to go to a lot of places tomorrow.

1581
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
Yeah.

1582
01:50:09,395 --> 01:50:10,395
Is there a zoo?

1583
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:13,020
Maybe there is.

1584
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:16,140
Like a aquarium or a zoo.

1585
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,600
We haven't been there recently.

1586
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,920
A place like a date.

1587
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:19,880
That's nice.

1588
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:21,560
We haven't been there.

1589
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:22,680
I'm excited.

1590
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:29,410
I can go anywhere with Hitomi.

1591
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:31,030
Really?

1592
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:32,050
Yes.

1593
01:50:32,051 --> 01:50:33,190
I'm glad.

1594
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,230
Really?

1595
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:34,770
Yes.

1596
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:37,030
I was able to come here thanks to you.

1597
01:50:40,505 --> 01:50:42,690
I think I need a chance like this.

1598
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:44,510
Yes.

1599
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:45,950
You're right.

1600
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,030
We were busy all the time.

1601
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:50,790
It's like an expression of love.

1602
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:52,110
Yes.

1603
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,760
We come here every year.

1604
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:58,150
Yeah, I want to cherish those memories.

1605
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:59,010
Yeah.

1606
01:50:59,650 --> 01:50:59,850
It's nice.

1607
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:01,410
Yeah.

1608
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:04,030
The yukata is very erotic.

1609
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:05,370
Erotic?

1610
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:06,310
It's sexy.

1611
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:07,430
Erotic?

1612
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:09,230
Really?

1613
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:11,430
I don't see it often.

1614
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,310
You don't wear it, do you?

1615
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:15,410
I don't think I've ever
worn it in front of you.

1616
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:16,630
Maybe.

1617
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:18,070
A proper yukata.

1618
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:20,490
It's erotic to be naked.

1619
01:51:20,491 --> 01:51:21,971
You look like you're wearing a skirt.

1620
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:23,750
Isn't it like that?

1621
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:25,270
Like that?

1622
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:27,130
Is this right?

1623
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:30,471
It's been a while since I
wore something like this.

1624
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,530
It's really nice.

1625
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,250
Stretch your legs.

1626
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:39,850
Like this?

1627
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:47,730
Isn't it too tight?

1628
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:49,390
Too tight?

1629
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:50,510
No.

1630
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:51,810
Because you have a big chest.

1631
01:51:51,811 --> 01:51:55,970
It's a yukata, so it
doesn't look tight, does it?

1632
01:51:57,090 --> 01:51:58,090
Does it look tight?

1633
01:51:58,920 --> 01:51:59,920
Have you grown up?

1634
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,850
No, I haven't.

1635
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:03,570
I haven't changed.

1636
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:04,250
Really?

1637
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:06,610
Let me touch you.

1638
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:10,410
It's good.

1639
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:12,830
Have I changed?

1640
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:15,270
Do I look like I'm taking a bath?

1641
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:17,410
You look so slender.

1642
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:18,490
Do I look slender?

1643
01:52:18,491 --> 01:52:19,491
You look so tired.

1644
01:52:21,395 --> 01:52:22,915
I didn't have a good sleep last night.

1645
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,260
I'm so nervous.

1646
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,370
We don't live together at home.

1647
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:38,950
You're right.
I always sleep when I'm tired.

1648
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:06,730
You look so bad.

1649
01:53:06,731 --> 01:53:10,150
It doesn't hurt at all, does it?

1650
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:13,330
It doesn't hurt at all.

1651
01:53:13,331 --> 01:53:14,331
It's very smooth.

1652
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:15,950
It has the effect of moisturizing.

1653
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,270
It's smoother than usual.

1654
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:29,450
I have a play I want to try.

1655
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:31,510
Play?

1656
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:33,190
What do you mean?

1657
01:53:33,615 --> 01:53:34,615
I want to hide my eyes.

1658
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,990
Covering your eyes?

1659
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,770
Yes.

1660
01:53:38,771 --> 01:53:39,010
Covering your eyes?

1661
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:40,470
Yes.

1662
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:41,690
Are you going to do it?

1663
01:53:41,691 --> 01:53:42,230
Yes.

1664
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:43,970
I want to do something exciting.

1665
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:46,870
I don't mind.

1666
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:48,851
But you've never done it, right?

1667
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:50,670
Let's do it.

1668
01:53:51,315 --> 01:53:52,350
I'm curious.

1669
01:53:53,170 --> 01:53:54,170
I can't do it at home.

1670
01:53:55,645 --> 01:53:57,170
Did you bring it?

1671
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:59,310
Just in case.

1672
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:01,450
If it doesn't work, I can't do it.

1673
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:02,550
I don't mind.

1674
01:54:02,551 --> 01:54:03,551
Really?

1675
01:54:03,690 --> 01:54:03,870
Yeah.

1676
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,670
Hold on a second.

1677
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,170
Okay.

1678
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:11,081
I like this kind of static play.

1679
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:12,910
Yeah, I agree.

1680
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:15,810
It's good to do something
you don't usually do.

1681
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,630
This is it.

1682
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,850
Oh, yeah.

1683
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,530
Should I put it on?

1684
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:23,650
Yeah.

1685
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,670
Like this?

1686
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,600
I can't see anything.

1687
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:34,390
Are you okay?

1688
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:35,930
Yeah, I'm fine.

1689
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:37,750
Like this?

1690
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:38,990
It's a little tight.

1691
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:40,090
What should I do?

1692
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:41,370
Is it like this?

1693
01:54:42,775 --> 01:54:44,350
If you shake it too
much... Will it come off?

1694
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:45,980
I mean, you can see it.

1695
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:47,570
Oh, I see.

1696
01:54:50,230 --> 01:54:51,230
Like this?

1697
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,590
Yeah.

1698
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:53,381
If it's too tight, it's fine.

1699
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:54,490
I don't know.

1700
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,281
If you can't see it, get excited.

1701
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,370
It's not like that.

1702
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:01,430
I don't know yet.

1703
01:55:01,431 --> 01:55:02,431
I don't know.

1704
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:04,041
Wait for me until I get there.

1705
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,640
What are you doing?

1706
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:14,550
Nothing.

1707
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,690
I'm fine.

1708
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:17,030
Nothing?

1709
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,210
How do you feel?

1710
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:04,430
Yes.

1711
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,760
What's wrong with you?

1712
01:56:44,265 --> 01:56:53,440
Good girl.

1713
01:56:54,135 --> 01:56:58,320
Do you want more?

1714
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:10,320
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or
not, but I'm going to give it a try.

1715
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:11,321
Do you want to eat it?

1716
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:27,740
Is this okay?

1717
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:37,600
I'm a little embarrassed.

1718
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:44,880
Can't I look at this?

1719
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:46,880
No.

1720
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:12,980
Not a good sign.

1721
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,840
Come here.

1722
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:16,260
Nope.

1723
01:58:16,261 --> 01:58:17,261
I'm scared.

1724
01:58:19,790 --> 01:58:22,780
You don't want to?

1725
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,820
No, thanks.

1726
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:37,820
What? Did you hit something?

1727
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:39,740
No, it's just my imagination.

1728
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:41,700
It's just your imagination?

1729
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,151
You're hitting something, aren't you?

1730
01:58:57,450 --> 01:58:58,610
I know I'm hitting something.

1731
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:22,391
I feel like something
is rubbing against me.

1732
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,140
Isn't it wet?

1733
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:33,940
Is it wet?

1734
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,820
I think it's wet.

1735
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:42,040
It's better to wear this, right?

1736
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:43,840
Yes.

1737
01:59:52,230 --> 01:59:53,490
What are you looking at?

1738
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,200
It's embarrassing.

1739
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:38,930
I'm sorry.

1740
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:14,620
It's so hard to open this.

1741
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:15,240
Really?

1742
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:16,600
Yeah.

1743
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:23,000
Ah!

1744
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:25,300
It's so hard to open this.

1745
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,760
Yeah.

1746
02:01:32,395 --> 02:01:39,480
I'm going to take this off.

1747
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:44,640
I'm going to take this off.

1748
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,680
I'm going to take this off.

1749
02:01:48,555 --> 02:01:51,380
I'm scared, I'm scared,
I'm scared, I'm scared.

1750
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:57,950
I'm going to do it.

1751
02:01:59,110 --> 02:01:59,790
Are you?

1752
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:00,950
Yes.

1753
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:38,190
保育用のアイテムを使っています。
多分、私はそれを使うことが大好きです。.

1754
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:40,910
だから、私はスポーツに入っているスポーツのインタビューをすることが好きです。.

1755
02:02:42,330 --> 02:02:45,950
私はもう一度、スポーツをとるので
今はもう少し球を見ていますね。.

1756
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:49,670
そして、私の新しいスペースが治ったので、
私は今はもう少しスペースをとります。.

1757
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:56,131
私は空腹に入ったがため息をしながら、 健康を取るように、.

1758
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:59,190
何かが分かるように、

1759
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:00,290
How do you feel?

1760
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:01,790
Your feet hurt?

1761
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:03,690
I cut your toenails.

1762
02:03:04,890 --> 02:03:06,070
You cut my toenails?

1763
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:16,070
You cut my toenails.

1764
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:25,450
It's so painful.

1765
02:03:25,451 --> 02:03:26,610
Mom, what's wrong?

1766
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:29,170
You look like you're in pain.

1767
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:30,970
I'm not in pain.

1768
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:33,670
What?

1769
02:03:35,290 --> 02:03:36,290
What's wrong?

1770
02:03:36,990 --> 02:03:37,990
What?

1771
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,430
Hello.

1772
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,710
Who are you?

1773
02:03:44,055 --> 02:03:45,490
Wait a minute.

1774
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:47,550
What's going on?

1775
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,790
I'm in pain.

1776
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:54,010
Mom, what's wrong?

1777
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:56,070
I don't know what to do.

1778
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:57,510
I don't know what to do.

1779
02:03:57,511 --> 02:03:58,511
Don't do that.

1780
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:00,610
What?

1781
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:02,950
What?

1782
02:04:07,370 --> 02:04:08,450
Hello.

1783
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:10,690
What?

1784
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:12,650
Wait a minute.

1785
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:14,510
What's going on?

1786
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:17,590
What?

1787
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:17,870
What?

1788
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:20,350
I called someone who has a big penis.

1789
02:04:20,351 --> 02:04:21,351
I called you.

1790
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:22,950
Really?

1791
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:25,530
What?

1792
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:26,950
You don't come back to my house.

1793
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:30,100
Really?

1794
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:33,430
Why did you call me?

1795
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:35,410
I wanted to record you.

1796
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:37,370
I don't understand you at all.

1797
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:39,620
Who is he?

1798
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:41,010
He is my friend.

1799
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,910
What?

1800
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:46,190
A friend?

1801
02:04:46,191 --> 02:04:47,191
What's this?

1802
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:50,610
This is quite big.

1803
02:04:55,050 --> 02:04:56,350
Chinko, you were talking a lot.

1804
02:04:57,410 --> 02:04:58,491
I was talking all the time?

1805
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:00,010
Yes.

1806
02:05:01,970 --> 02:05:02,970
Thank you.

1807
02:05:12,730 --> 02:05:14,730
How is it?

1808
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:41,240
What's going on?

1809
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:42,960
What's going on?

1810
02:05:42,961 --> 02:05:44,220
What? What do you mean?

1811
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:48,140
You know, I'm always like this.

1812
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,040
No, I'm not.

1813
02:05:58,130 --> 02:06:08,560
I'm going to stab you.

1814
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,460
Thanks.

1815
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:41,800
I'm so happy.

1816
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:48,820
I will do my best from now on.

1817
02:06:51,550 --> 02:06:52,110
Thank you.

1818
02:06:52,111 --> 02:06:53,830
Yua-kun, what are you doing?

1819
02:06:54,290 --> 02:06:55,830
Yes, that's what I'm doing.

1820
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:04,411
It's a little late, so let's go over there.

1821
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:06,710
Is that okay?

1822
02:07:07,010 --> 02:07:08,010
Yes.

1823
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:10,270
Oh, a little?

1824
02:07:10,510 --> 02:07:11,510
Yes.

1825
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:13,270
What?

1826
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:14,830
Is that so?

1827
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:16,910
What?

1828
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:17,310
What?

1829
02:07:18,010 --> 02:07:19,010
What?

1830
02:07:24,610 --> 02:07:26,290
Ok, let's eat!

1831
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:36,370
You said you felt good, didn't you?

1832
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:40,070
But it's not me, It's him

1833
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:41,220
It's cold, isn't it?

1834
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:44,250
Is it cold all the time?

1835
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:45,350
Yes.

1836
02:07:46,925 --> 02:07:47,925
Is it cold?

1837
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:52,310
I'm sorry.

1838
02:07:55,650 --> 02:07:57,530
I don't mind if you feel better.

1839
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,030
I want to see you panting.

1840
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:05,590
Please play with him.

1841
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:08,450
Do you want me to play with him?

1842
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:13,130
Do you want to see it?

1843
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:15,070
Yes, I want to see it.

1844
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:17,790
You want to see it, don't you?

1845
02:08:17,810 --> 02:08:18,910
It's my wish.

1846
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:23,970
I don't have a chance like this.

1847
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:27,930
I'll think about it.

1848
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:31,990
Like this?

1849
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:33,590
Yes.

1850
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:35,670
I want you to do it for me.

1851
02:08:35,671 --> 02:08:37,711
I want to ask you
something, so I'll do it for you.

1852
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:39,050
What?

1853
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:40,430
Here?

1854
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:42,120
Yes, yes, yes.

1855
02:08:48,690 --> 02:08:50,130
You have a lot of hair.

1856
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:59,090
Around here?

1857
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,360
It's a little different from Yuka.

1858
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:20,500
But the difference between
black and white is obvious.

1859
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:50,220
You get excited when you see this.

1860
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,560
Yes.

1861
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:06,130
Is that so?

1862
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,770
It's so delicious.

1863
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:12,090
It's good.

1864
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:13,730
Can you give me more?

1865
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:31,031
It's bigger than mine, isn't it?

1866
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:33,410
It's big.

1867
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:35,931
I think it's a little thick.

1868
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:43,940
Is this okay?

1869
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:45,800
It's fine.

1870
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:00,890
It's very weak.

1871
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,160
Rub more.

1872
02:11:33,195 --> 02:11:34,195
Rub?

1873
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:35,420
I want to see that.

1874
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:39,570
This is really good.

1875
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:53,910
I can't help but look at this.

1876
02:11:57,390 --> 02:11:58,390
That's a lot.

1877
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:12,050
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

1878
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:13,570
What?

1879
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:15,130
You can't do that.

1880
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:19,530
Your mouth is 10 times bigger than mine.

1881
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:21,910
It's not that big.

1882
02:12:24,790 --> 02:12:25,951
Can you put it in your mouth?

1883
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:30,701
I want to see you feel it.

1884
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:33,790
I want you to put it in your mouth.

1885
02:12:33,791 --> 02:12:34,831
What do you want me to do?

1886
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:36,841
What do you want me to do?

1887
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:39,850
Get on the bed and sleep on it.

1888
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:40,750
Do I sleep on it?

1889
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:41,110
Yes.

1890
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:42,450
What about the rubber?

1891
02:12:42,451 --> 02:12:43,451
Rubber?

1892
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:44,810
There is no rubber here.

1893
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:47,310
Can I sleep on it?

1894
02:12:47,490 --> 02:12:48,730
Yes, you can sleep on it.

1895
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:50,230
Really?

1896
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:51,550
Yes.

1897
02:12:52,990 --> 02:12:53,990
Can I sleep on it?

1898
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:55,730
It's bigger than the yukata.

1899
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:57,820
Yes, it is.

1900
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:07,880
Oh, wow.

1901
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:11,120
Oh, no.

1902
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:12,380
It's in.

1903
02:13:12,675 --> 02:13:13,880
Oh, it's in.

1904
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:15,600
Wow.

1905
02:13:18,150 --> 02:13:22,000
It's really in.

1906
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:23,740
Yes.

1907
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:26,220
Wow.

1908
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:28,300
Yes.

1909
02:13:29,970 --> 02:13:30,970
Oh, wow.

1910
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:33,820
How is it?

1911
02:13:34,370 --> 02:13:35,100
It's totally different, isn't it?

1912
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:36,101
Is it bigger than mine?

1913
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,340
No, it's not.

1914
02:13:38,950 --> 02:13:42,940
It's bigger than mine.

1915
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:50,950
It's not good.

1916
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:52,710
Move more.

1917
02:13:53,050 --> 02:13:54,890
I can't move.

1918
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:57,831
I want to see where you are going.

1919
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,740
It's good.

1920
02:14:08,741 --> 02:14:09,741
It's really good.

1921
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,380
Oh, my God.

1922
02:14:20,690 --> 02:14:21,920
There's a lot in there.

1923
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:26,640
Oh, no.

1924
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:44,930
I'm going to go.

1925
02:14:45,370 --> 02:14:47,670
Show me where you're going.

1926
02:14:48,110 --> 02:14:50,250
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1927
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:01,631
You don't usually go that fast.

1928
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:27,540
I'm going again.

1929
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:28,860
Can I?

1930
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:29,760
Yes.

1931
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:30,960
Oh, my.

1932
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:33,400
Oh, my.

1933
02:15:36,510 --> 02:15:37,510
Oh, my.

1934
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:49,530
Oh, my.

1935
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:50,410
Oh, my.

1936
02:15:50,411 --> 02:15:50,450
Oh, my.

1937
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:51,750
I want to drink more.

1938
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:55,390
I have to drink it.

1939
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:57,970
Oh, my.

1940
02:15:57,971 --> 02:15:58,470
I'm sorry.

1941
02:15:58,870 --> 02:16:00,370
Oh, my.

1942
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:01,870
Oh, my.

1943
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:03,130
Oh, my.

1944
02:16:03,131 --> 02:16:03,170
Oh, my.

1945
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:05,050
Oh, my.

1946
02:16:13,070 --> 02:16:23,211
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Uh huh.

1947
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:25,170
Oh.

1948
02:16:26,210 --> 02:16:27,590
Oh.

1949
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:31,711
Oh Oh Oh Oh...

1950
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:33,050
Oh... Ah!

1951
02:16:33,650 --> 02:16:34,210
Ah!

1952
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:37,050
No... No, no, no, no, no!

1953
02:16:37,051 --> 02:16:38,830
Kosei, no... No,
no, no, no, no, no!

1954
02:16:38,831 --> 02:16:39,150
Yuka!

1955
02:16:39,530 --> 02:16:40,530
Ah!

1956
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:44,231
Fuuuu... Oh!

1957
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:44,770
Oh...

1958
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:47,491
Uhh... Eh?

1959
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:49,970
Ooh... Eh?

1960
02:16:50,350 --> 02:16:50,950
Eh, Eh?

1961
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:52,791
Hm... Is it hot?

1962
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,710
Yeah, yeah.

1963
02:16:53,850 --> 02:16:55,510
Can't tell if you're sweating, right?

1964
02:16:55,511 --> 02:16:59,730
Ooh... Hm... Show me... Hmmm...

1965
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:18,670
I did my best.

1966
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,200
It's okay.

1967
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:23,250
It's okay?

1968
02:17:24,830 --> 02:17:26,771
But... It's too dark.

1969
02:17:28,710 --> 02:17:30,110
Is it okay?

1970
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:31,890
It's okay.

1971
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:39,080
I want to see you feel
it at a different level.

1972
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:42,090
You've become four-legged.

1973
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,820
Four-legged?

1974
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:46,420
You can still do it.

1975
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:49,640
I can't do it at all if I do it once.

1976
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:51,480
Do you still do it?

1977
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:53,300
Yes.

1978
02:17:58,650 --> 02:17:59,650
Turn this way.

1979
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:01,060
This way?

1980
02:18:01,061 --> 02:18:02,061
Yes.

1981
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:02,500
Really?

1982
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:03,780
Yes.

1983
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,740
Ah!

1984
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:10,100
Ah!

1985
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:15,840
How do you feel?

1986
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:17,190
It's not good.

1987
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:20,660
Not good?

1988
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:21,140
Yes.

1989
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:22,921
It's totally different from me.

1990
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:24,620
Yes.

1991
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:25,460
I know.

1992
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:27,200
I'm going to take a bath.

1993
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:29,100
Ah!

1994
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:29,960
Ah!

1995
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:31,760
I'm sorry. I feel sick.

1996
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:32,980
No.

1997
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,700
Ah!

1998
02:18:33,701 --> 02:18:34,701
ah.

1999
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,800
ah.

2000
02:18:39,930 --> 02:18:40,310
ah.

2001
02:18:40,690 --> 02:18:42,911
ah ah ah.

2002
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:02,460
ah.

2003
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:13,691
The smell is so strong
I can't breathe ah.

2004
02:19:14,470 --> 02:19:15,470
ah.

2005
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:22,651
Ah ah.

2006
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:29,961
Look at me ah ah.

2007
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,020
ah.

2008
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:32,600
ah.

2009
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:35,260
ah ah.

2010
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:41,461
ah ah You have a lot of
blood in your mouth ah.

2011
02:19:42,390 --> 02:19:43,400
I can't do this.

2012
02:20:15,810 --> 02:20:43,620
It's so hot!

2013
02:21:00,650 --> 02:21:03,386
A little bit more, and you are going
to make it, I know you can do it!

2014
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:06,290
There you go.

2015
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:07,010
I made it?

2016
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:09,710
Yes, you did.

2017
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:11,590
Look at you, you are going
to make it much easier.

2018
02:21:11,591 --> 02:21:12,591
I'm not going to make it.

2019
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:16,940
Here it comes.

2020
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:18,500
Here it comes.

2021
02:21:18,570 --> 02:21:18,590
There you go.

2022
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:19,030
There you go.

2023
02:21:19,031 --> 02:21:20,031
Okay, lift.

2024
02:21:20,910 --> 02:21:21,530
There you go.

2025
02:21:21,531 --> 02:21:22,390
Breathe.

2026
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:26,970
Oh, my God.

2027
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:29,790
Damn, that's good, right there.

2028
02:21:35,050 --> 02:21:37,400
Oh, my God.

2029
02:21:37,401 --> 02:21:40,400
Oh, my God.

2030
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:41,820
Oh, my God.

2031
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:42,620
Oh, my God.

2032
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:43,920
Oh, my God.

2033
02:21:45,295 --> 02:21:46,295
It's so hot.

2034
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:47,960
Oh, my God.

2035
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,600
Let me touch you.

2036
02:21:49,601 --> 02:21:50,740
Let me see your face.

2037
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:54,040
