1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,860
The wind is so strong.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,600
Today, I'm going to
shoot a video for Aipoke.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,060
I'm in Odaiba now.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,340
I was told that I can go on a date here.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,620
So I'm going to go on a date.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,820
But I don't know who the person I'm going
to meet is, so I'm going to meet him here.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,120
I'm looking at the scenery of
Odaiba alone with a camera.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,360
I've never had a date before, so I don't
know what to do if I have a date in Odaiba.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,020
Good morning.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,160
Good morning.

11
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:53,580
Ohayou gozaimasu!

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,960
Oh, you're Ohayou?

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,040
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,220
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm Kuroi.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,220
I'm Monogi.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,020
Let's hold the camera.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,420
Please.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,400
It's nice to meet you.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,901
First of all, I'm from Odaiba.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Nice to meet you.

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,060
What should I call you?

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,120
I'm Kuroi Yu.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm Yu-kun.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,660
I'm Momo-chan.

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,720
I haven't been on a date much.

30
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:46,780
I don't come to Odaiba often,
so I don't know where to go.

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,940
Do you have a place you want to go?

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,480
I want to go inside.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Do you want to go inside?

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Thank you.

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,500
Is it okay if we don't
take a picture together?

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,020
Oh, that's good.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm happy.

38
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,140
It's a date, so I'd like to flirt with you.

39
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,660
I've never done a date-like flirting.

40
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
Oh, really?

41
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,160
Is that so?

42
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Yeah, that's right.

43
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,780
So I'm wondering if I can flirt with you.

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,160
Do you want to have a flirty date?

45
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:51,620
Do you mean you want to have sex with me?

46
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Yes, I do.

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,940
It's written LOVE on your back.

48
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,360
I don't want to have sex with you.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,220
Shall we go?

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,380
Yes, let's go.

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:06,940
Let's go.

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
I can't speak in honorifics.

53
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,760
Speaking of sexual things,

54
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,240
I have an ideal.

55
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,590
I want to have sex with you.

56
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,340
I want to have sex with you
because we have a gay relationship.

57
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,840
I want to take a picture with you.

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,780
Did you take a picture with
me when you were a student?

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,980
I took a picture with my friend.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,760
I don't want to take a
picture with you all the time.

61
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Why?

62
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,980
I don't want to take a
picture with you all the time.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,220
Here?

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Isn't it too dark?

65
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,960
Is it okay?

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Is it okay?

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,880
There are not many people.

68
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,520
I can see the restaurant.

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,400
Let's kiss.

70
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Suddenly?

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Isn't this a place like that?

72
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,760
Isn't it?

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,840
Someone will come.

74
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,310
What?

75
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,010
Is this a date?

76
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,070
That's right.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,750
I got it right.

78
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,610
Yuu-kun taught me how to date.

79
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,030
This is it.

80
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,170
I found it.

81
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,470
I found it.

82
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,670
It's been a long time.

83
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,130
I found it.

84
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,170
I love snacks.

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,910
I love snacks.

86
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,870
Do you eat snacks?

87
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,750
I love it.

88
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,790
I miss it.

89
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,791
Isn't it fun?

90
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,790
I like this, too.

91
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,530
It's nostalgic.

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,650
Do I have to suck it?

93
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,310
We used to eat it with coke.

94
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,330
I see.

95
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,410
I like it, too.

96
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,230
Thank you.

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,520
Is it good?

98
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:58,521
Is it good?

99
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,100
It's like...

100
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,080
It's like... It's
like... It's like...

101
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:14,100
It's been a while since
I had this sour taste.

102
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Your face is sour.

103
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
Do you want some?

104
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I'll have some.

105
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,540
I'll have some.

106
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,200
I'll kiss you.

107
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,320
I'll kiss you.

108
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm trying to cut it in half.

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,480
Let's kiss.

110
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,140
It's red.

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,560
Is it okay?

112
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
What are you going to do?
You have one left.

113
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,620
Well, it's okay.

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,780
Then, I'll cut it in half.

115
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,180
It's so good.

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
It's so good.

117
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
It's amazing.

118
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm getting excited.

119
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm hungry.

120
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,060
Are you hungry?

121
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Let's eat.

122
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,740
Shall we go?

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,140
What is it?

124
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,180
This is good.

125
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
Really?

126
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,960
It's good.

127
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Do you want to try it?

128
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,410
It's my first time to eat ice cream.

129
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,930
Really?

130
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,850
I didn't eat ice cream before.

131
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,030
It's good.

132
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,350
It's good.

133
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,550
It's our first time to meet each other.

134
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,990
What is your first
impression of each other?

135
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,220
First impression...

136
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,480
I saw your outfit today, and I
thought you were a refreshing person.

137
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,200
Really?

138
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,620
I thought you were an actor.

139
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,740
It's very natural today.

140
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,260
It's a strange feeling.

141
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm glad.

142
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
What about me?

143
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,420
What kind of fashion do you like?

144
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I like legs.

145
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,700
I'm glad to hear that.

146
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,560
I think men like this
kind of fashion the most.

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,140
I don't like to show my legs.

148
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,320
I like to hide my legs a little.

149
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,100
I like to wear fashionable
clothes, but I like to show my legs.

150
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
You like healthy clothes, right?

151
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
Yes, I like healthy clothes.

152
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,100
It's a realistic opinion.

153
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
It's a healthy foot.

154
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,580
I'm talking too much.

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Is it okay?

156
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,920
It's okay.

157
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,280
It's a date.

158
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,500
I was looking forward
to my partner would be.

159
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,220
That's why I had a good impression.

160
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,180
I can't do anything when I'm stopped.

161
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,480
There are a lot of people.

162
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,200
I thought I'd focus.

163
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,440
When I go abroad,

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,060
I can say hello in a place like this.

165
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,260
It's like, I'm home.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,700
Try it.

167
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,220
I'm home.

168
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:43,020
It's not like that, but it's
okay if it's that open, isn't it?

169
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
That's right.

170
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,320
I don't think it's going to be filmed.

171
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Love.

172
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,600
I was forgiven for my long eyes.

173
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,020
I'm getting excited
because I'm in front of love.

174
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,820
We've been on a date for a long time.

175
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm starting to loosen up.

176
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,860
Do you like me now?

177
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
I love you so much.

178
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,320

182
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,200
The weather is so nice today.

186
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,290
Because.

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,880
Let me hold you.

192
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:31,730
It's the sea.

193
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,610
You look stupid.

194
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,410
Run again.

195
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,510
I'm crying.

196
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,390
This way.

197
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,110
Wait a minute.

198
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,310
I'm embarrassed.

199
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,330
Wait a minute.

200
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,130
I thought you would do it now.

201
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,670
You did it.

202
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,430
You did it.

203
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,970
I'm sorry, I didn't take it.

204
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,810
You know the promise.

205
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,670
Like this.

206
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:35,590
I can't see the screen at all.

207
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,650
It's good.

208
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,050
Someone is watching.

209
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm watching.

210
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,001

213
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,260
I was looking at you
I was looking at you.

214
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,281
People can see us
People can see us.

215

Let's go to a place where people
can't see us Let's move Let's move

216
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:02,930
Don't hide from the camera
Why are you hiding your face?

217
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,270
Why are you hiding your face?

218
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,410
Let's move You are so shy.

219
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,691
Finally, we are alone
Finally, we are alone I'm shy.

220
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,730
You are shy.

221
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,910
I'm shy.

222
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,030
You are right.

223
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,040
Why are you shy?

224
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
It's too late.

225
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
It's too late.

226
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,670
Because I'm not usually shy.

227
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,790
Why are you touching me?

228
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,190
I'm shy.

229
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,570
I might do it in this situation.

230
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,980
In this situation?

231
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,560

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,810
Yes, I did.

243
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,490
Are you going?

244
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,470
Not yet.

245
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:35,460
I can't hear the camera.

246
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,780
I can't hear the camera.

247
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,080
I can hear the camera.

248
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,420
I can hear it.

249
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:44,421
You can hear it.

250
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,220
Let's go to the hotel.

251
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,030

254
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,260
Let's go.

255
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,261
Let's go.

256
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:08,935
Isn't it amazing?

257
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,290
It's so beautiful.

258
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,010
Where is it?

259
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,070
It's over there.

260
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,730
I'm excited.

261
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,930
I wonder if everyone is already doing it.

262
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,210
What is that?

263
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,290
Why do you say that?

264
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,030
Because it's such a place.

265
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,370
That's right.

266
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,790
Oh no.

267
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,710
I'll show you when we get in.

268
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,730
We haven't got in yet.

269
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,530
Here?

270
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,590
Yes.

271
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,830
It looks spacious.

272
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,170
It's beautiful.

273
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,890
It's a spacious room.

274
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,630
Really?

275
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,150
I'll open it.

276
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,910
Ready, go.

277
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,290
Oh! It's so big!

278
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,330
It's so big!

279
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,930
It's so beautiful.

280
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,710
I'm so excited.

281
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,390
I'm so excited.

282
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
You're so enthusiastic.

283
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You didn't like it?

284
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,060
No, I didn't.

285
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,390
We were doing something.

286
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,710
We were doing something.

287
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,650
It's good to see you in person.

288
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,640
It's good to see you in person.

289
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,870
Why did you say that?

290
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,330
It was a strange feeling.

291
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,550
Can I blame you?

292
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,010
Do you like me?

293
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:27,270
You're a bit of an enemy.

294
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,790
It feels good.

295
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,040
Hey, take it off.

296
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Oh!

297
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,100
Are you excited?

298
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,836
Which one do you want to take off?

299
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
I'm excited.

300
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,850
I can't do both.

301
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,530
I can hold it.

302
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,510
I want to touch both.

303
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,991
It's like... What?

304
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,410
Isn't it big?

305
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,410
What do you mean?

306
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,330
It's not as big as before.

307
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,450
I see.

308
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,210
Do you care about it?

309
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,730
No, I don't.

310
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,830
I've never cared about it.

311
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,130
Do you like it?

312
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,510
Yes.

313
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,910
It looks comfortable.

314
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,460
Let's touch it together.

315
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,970
I'm sorry.

316
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:02,770
I'm sad.

317
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,870
Your reaction is cute.

318
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,270
I'm sad.

319
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,750
Can I lick your tongue?

320
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,751
Do you want to sleep?

321
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,810
It feels good.

322
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,380
I like to do it without making a sound.

323
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,720
Does it feel good?

324
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
It feels really good.

325
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,320
Why do you feel like that?

326
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,740
Because I did a lot.

327
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,400
I've been doing a lot.

328
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
You've been doing a lot.

329
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,960
Am I doing a good job?

330
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Yeah.

331
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,580
Because it's amazing.

332
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,120
It's in my mouth.

333
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,400
Your stomach is growling.

334
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,450
What kind of feral animals do you like?

335
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,910
I like to be licked.

336
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:13,911
Do you like to be licked?

337
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,510
I like to be licked.

338
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,850
Do you like to be licked hard?

339
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,670
Yes.

340
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,950
You don't have to go
all the way to the back.

341
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
Come here.

342
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,710
Lie down.

343
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,990
I'll do it for you.

344
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,980
Don't you want to go to the gym?

345
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,650
It feels good.

346
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,090
I like it more intense.

347
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:29,091
I like the big one.

348
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,710
It's so beautiful.

349
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,450
What is that?

350
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,220
Why are you licking it?

351
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,490
Why are you licking it?

352
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,870
Lick it.

353
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:10,500
No, don't look at it.

354
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,190
I don't want you to look at it.

355
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,900
No?

356
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
No.

357
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
No.

358
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,550
You never look at me.

359
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,370
So...

360
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,490
Concentrate.

361
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,290
I'm shy.

362
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,406
You're shy because it's just a date.

363
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,110
Stop it.

364
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:16,650
Stop it!

365
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,010
You don't want to?

366
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,350
Stop it!

367
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,890
I'll do it for you.

368
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,250
You don't like it, do you?

369
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:39,340
You don't like to be looked at, do you?

370
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Aren't you embarrassed?

371
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
I like to be looked at.

372
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,950
What's that?

373
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,030
How did it feel?

374
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,150
How was the bath?

375
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,590
It was my first time.

376
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,610
Really.

377
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,110
I don't know because I'm not good at baths.

378
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,610
How did it feel?

379
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,870
I felt like I was being hugged.

380
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,940
Like you were being hugged?

381
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,910
I'm sorry.

382
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:40,911
You're so nice.

383
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,450
Do you want to take a bite?

384
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,310
No, it's too big.

385
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,530
You're a good actor.

386
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,230
You can take a lot, right?

387
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,970
I can take a lot.

388
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:38,350
Is it good?

389
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,380
Ouch!

390
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:18,470
It's hot.

391
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,300
I'm going to eat it all.

392
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,110
I'm going to eat it all.

393
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:55,350
It's clean.

394
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
I'll wipe it for you.

395
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
You're really good at it.

396
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,220
Is this your first time?

397
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:18,221
Really?

398
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,420
No, I don't

399
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:24,181
You don't take it off
in the morning It's cute.

400
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,980
Because it's a photoshoot?

401
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Yes.

402
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's go.

403
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,730
Take this off.

404
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,890
It's embarrassing.

405
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,250
Why?

406
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,510
Let's go.

407
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,410
I'll let you go.

408
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,210
It's kind of...

409
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,450
It's kind of embarrassing.

410
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,270
All of a sudden.

411
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:15,060
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

412
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,860
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

413
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,660
I can't.

414
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,230
You're making us laugh.

415
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,456
Don't laugh while looking at me.

416
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,330
I'm sure you'll look at me.

417
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,390
No, no, no.

418
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
It feels good.

419
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,490
Look into my eyes and tell me.

420
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,950
How do you feel?

421
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:49,750
I feel good.

422
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,751
You are cute.

423
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,650
Oh, no.

424
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,850
What's wrong?

425
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,870
I don't want to be licked.

426
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,870
Why are you hiding your face?

427
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,070
I'm embarrassed.

428
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,110
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

429
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,490
I know.

430
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:28,510

431
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:46,510

437
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
How is it?

00:43:34,750 --> 00:44:00,580
It feels good.

439
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,340

440
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,200

441
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,300
It felt good.

442
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:13,660
I'm glad.

443
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:21,120
Let's take a bath together.

444
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,020
Hug me.

445
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,670
I'm sorry

446
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,230
Are you okay?

447
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,090
You are sweating.

448
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,860
You know what?

449
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,780
I want you to put your face on it.

450
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,000
What?

451
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,660
I want you to put your face on it.

452
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,351
Are you trying to be funny?

453
00:45:51,755 --> 00:45:54,396
I'm not trying to be funny, but I
want you to put your face on it.

454
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,140
No, I don't want to do that.

455
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Wait a minute.

456
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Wait a minute.

457
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,980
Do you want it?

458
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,680
It feels good.

459
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,100
Oh, no.

460
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I can't.

461
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,490
Here you go.

462
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,530
I put it in.

463
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:03,170
I put it in.

464
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,470
Did you already put it in?

465
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,530
Can I?

466
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:33,690
I put it in.

467
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,150
Why?

468
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:37,151
What?

469
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,830
That's how you feel.

470
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,150
I don't know.

471
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:11,660
Look at me.

472
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,330
What?

473
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,500
Why are you touching me?

474
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
Good boy.

475
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,870
Good boy.

476
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,560
Good boy.

477

Why?

481
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,730
Why?

482
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,210
Why are you embarrassed?

483
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,130
Why?

484
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,390
I don't know.

485
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,590
Why are you being attacked?

486
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,890
I'm embarrassed.

487
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:14,130

488
00:50:51,440 --> 00:51:00,790
Does it feel good?

489
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,150
Isn't it embarrassing to have tongue out?

490
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,670
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

491
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:29,490
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:32,810
It's embarrassing to be blamed, isn't it?

493
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:39,190
It's cute.

494
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,840
It hurts.

What is not good?

00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,170
The shape is not good.

00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,630
What is not good?

00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,050
What do you mean?

00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,150
The compatibility is not good.

Your shoulders are so stiff.

516
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,010
I want to let it out.

517
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,290
Can I?

518
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,580
Yes, you can.

519
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,930
Where do you want to let it out?

520
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,860
Oh, no.

521
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,130
There.

522
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,550
Let me go!

523
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:40,610
Give me your hand.

524
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,580
I'm sorry.

525
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,980
I didn't mean to.

526
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:15,900
It was good, wasn't it?

527
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,150
It felt good, didn't it?

528
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,210
I'm so embarrassed.

529
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:23,930
What?

530
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,360
What?

531
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,180
You?

532
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,780
It's me.

533
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,140
It's not M.

534
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,160
It's true.

535
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,820
I don't want to be blamed.

536
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
I'm embarrassed.

537
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,131
It's fun to see your reaction.

538
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,540
It doesn't make sense.

539
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,740
Are you licking me?

540
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,090
I want to drink this cup.

541
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:33,930
Today?

542
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,350
Today is a cup.

543
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,330
Today is a cup.

544
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:38,331
I'm glad to hear that.

545
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,220
Isn't this room amazing?

546
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,240
Wow!

547
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,580
It's a different room.

548
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,780
There's another room here.

549
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,140
This room is cute.

550
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,440
What is this?

551
01:02:59,441 --> 01:03:00,000
Macaroon?

552
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:00,600
Macaroon.

553
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,980
This room is like a fairy tale.

554
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,220
Macaroon.

555
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,120
It's a snack room.

556
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,640
Wow!

557
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,760
That was a snack, too.

558
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,100
That's right. All of them are snacks.

559
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:15,800
Wow, I want to see a lot of things.

560
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:29,580
Oh, I found something good.

561
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,060
I'll guess.

562
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:33,680
Do I get it right?

563
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,180
Do I get it right?

564
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,280
Do I get it right?

565
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,180
A toy.

566
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:41,440
You're so perverted
What are you doing?

567
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,200
It's a toy, right?

568
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,621
Too bad Too bad.

569
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:49,380
Give me a hint

570
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:53,440
The hint is I was going to
give you a hint The hint is.

571
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,191
Ah, so when we took the
picture of today's purikura.

572
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,780
Was there a bit of it?

573
01:03:58,781 --> 01:03:59,781
Did you put it on?

574
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Did you put it on?

575
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,560
Ah!

576
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,000
Cat ears.

577
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,710
Ding!

578
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:09,920
Ta-dah!

579
01:04:10,995 --> 01:04:11,995
Wow, it's cosplay!

580
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Wow!

581
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,900
It means put it on, right?

582
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,920
That's right.

583
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:25,080
Look, it has a tail It's cute And
It's similar to the one on Purikura

584
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:27,260
It's similar to the one
you put on your shoulder.

585
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:28,261
It's black.

586
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,460
Then it's okay.

587
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,780
Me?

588
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,820
Then it's okay.

589
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,840
It's so cute.

590
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,620
I'll put it on.

591
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:42,621
Isn't it so cute?

592
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,600
It's definitely not going to fit.

593
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,291
Did you prepare it for me?

594
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,520
It's not going to fit at this point.

595
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:51,521
I can't get in.

596
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,540
It's creepy.

597
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,080
Come on.

598
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,640
Isn't it great?

599
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,060
Wait a minute.

600
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,000
First of all, this.

601
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:11,130
Like this?

602
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,410
You are so cute!

603
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,670
Thank you!

604
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:23,671
Thank you!

605
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:25,710
You are so cute!

606
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:27,850
You are so cute!

607
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,990
Give me a kiss!

608
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:31,210
No!

609
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,610
No!

610
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:34,970
Why not?

611
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,230
Because cats are a bit weird.

612
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,250
I don't think they do that.

613
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:42,790
No!

614
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,110
Can you give me a kiss?

615
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,111
Do you have a cat?

616
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:47,410
I have a cat.

617
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,830
A long time ago?

618
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,570
I have a cat now.

619
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,010
Do you want to kiss?

620
01:05:54,335 --> 01:05:55,335
I have a cat.

621
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:06,010
It's the biggest expression of affection.

622
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:11,450
Why?

623
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,690
lol.

624
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,051
She doesn't want me to kiss her.

625
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,090
This means.

626
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:26,710
this is mine.

627
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,610
I see.

628
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,090
No

629
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:47,710
She doesn't want me to kiss her anymore.

630
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,450
Do you want to change?

631
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,671
Can I take a video of you changing?

632
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,530
What is that?

633
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,510
Don't you have karaoke here?

634
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,770
Karaoke?

635
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,390
Can I have a microphone?

636
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:19,770
No.

637
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,890
What is that? Is that a bra?

638
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,130
Yes, it is.

639
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,750
It is very wide bra.

640
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:32,990
Oh, it's spacious.

641
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,850
How do you like it?

642
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:39,270
I like it.

643
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,670
Do you like it?

644
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:45,830
It's not like Chijo.

645
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,510
It's M, isn't it?

646
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,370
It's M, isn't it?

647
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,550
No, it's not.

648
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,890
It's not M, but you like Chijo.

649
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,790
I like Chijo.

650
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,070
It can't be helped.

651
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,630
It's a little difficult, isn't it?

652
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,871
Oh, this is how you open it.

653
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,370
Is it difficult?

654
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:14,850
Is it difficult?

655
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,330
It's difficult.

656
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,350
Take a picture of me.

657
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,090
I like it.

658
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,270
I like it.

659
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,311
Isn't there a lot of people
wearing knitted tights?

660
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,210
On a daily basis.

661
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,430
You don't look at it much these days.

662
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,970
Do you get excited when
you see someone wearing it?

663
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:44,890
What?

664
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:46,870
Why do you think I'm wearing it?

665
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,490
Do you think you're full of motivation?

666
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,190
I think I'm a pervert.

667
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:54,850
Are you excited?

668
01:08:54,925 --> 01:09:04,990
It's supposed to be worn to protect
you, but it doesn't mean anything, does it?

669
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,210
That's true.

670
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,981
It's supposed to be worn to show off.

671
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:31,010
Oh, it's got a tail.

672
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,150
Yeah.

673
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,250
It's in there.

674
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,420
Oh, the tail is long.

675
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,220
The tail is long.

676
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,620
It's done.

677
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,240
It's cute.

678
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,720
What are you doing?

679
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,920
Don't you cosplay?

680
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,420
No, I don't.

681
01:10:04,421 --> 01:10:05,140
Is there anyone who cosplays a man?

682
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:07,221
Is there anyone who wants
to cosplay as a black cat?

683
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,370
Yes, I'm a black cat.

684
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,970
Why is your tail so long?

685
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,010
My tail is long.

686
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,730
You are a cat with a long tail.

687
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,970
What did you say?

688
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:30,870
I said the impression of a cat.

689
01:10:34,165 --> 01:10:36,390
I found it around here.

690
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,500
I tried to make it cute.

691
01:10:46,045 --> 01:10:50,020
I don't want to turn it all the time.

692
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,380
Come here.

693
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,760
Let's sit down.

694
01:11:10,295 --> 01:11:15,030
Come here.

695
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:16,290
Hey! Come here!

696
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:17,990
Why are you putting your butt here?

697
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:20,950
You look like a pervert.

698
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:24,410
Come here!

699
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,971
Why are you looking at me like that?

700
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,250
Are you showing your affection?

701
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:41,430
I won't kiss you because you
are a cat I already kissed you

702
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:46,870
I won't kiss you.

703
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,210
I'm sure she's still hungry.

704
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,670
I'm going to give you a snack.

705
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:41,700
I'm giving you a snack.

706
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:50,730
You want me to lick you?

707
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:51,731
Yeah.

708
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,330
Is it good?

709
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,110
Yeah.

710
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:58,650
Come here.

711
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,900
Hey Come here.

712
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:23,280
You are getting hard.

713
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,630
Ah.

714
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,380
Why are you sticking out your tongue?

715
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,200
It's hard, isn't it?

716
01:14:30,201 --> 01:14:32,260
No, it's not.

717
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:35,380
No, it's not.

718
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's hard.

719
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,100
It's amazing.

720
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:56,860
It's transparent.

721
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,460
It's transparent.

722
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,950
It's hard, isn't it?

723
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,050
I don't know why.

724
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:07,051
Do you want to eat it?

725
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,310
Hey, what is this?

726
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,360
Hurry up and eat it!

727
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,370
Hurry up and eat it!

728
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:00,690
Hey, what are you doing?

729
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,710
You're doing aegyo
with your knitted tights.

730
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,770
Hey, you.

731
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,390
Shut up.

732
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:11,850
You're doing aegyo.

733
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:15,290
I'm not doing aegyo. I'm touching you.

734
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,530
It feels good.
Is it different with knitted tights?

735
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,750
It feels good.

736
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,390
Really?

737
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,120
Do you like everything?

738
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:01,470
I like everything.

739
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,000
What's your favorite?

740
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,480
I won't tell you.

741
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:06,900
Why?

742
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,420
I won't tell you.

743
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,460
Why?

744
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,620
Don't rub it on me.

745
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,300
I'll rub it on you.

746
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:29,630
I'll rub it on you.

747
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,940
What are you doing?

748
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:45,460
I want to play with you, too.

749
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,990
You are moving.

750
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,290
You are moving.

751
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:25,550
Wait a minute.

752
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,490
Here you are.

753
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:33,230
Here you are.

754
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,150
Why are you wet?

755
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,990
Why are you wet?

756
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,550
Why are you wet?

757
01:19:43,415 --> 01:19:50,120
I'm wet.

758
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,360
No.

759
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:53,650
Oh, no.

760
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,070
What's wrong?

761
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:04,930
I don't want to go because it feels good.

762
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:10,790
I don't want to go.

763
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,250
I don't want to go.

764
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:28,090
I really don't want to go.

765
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,110
Eri!

766
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,010
Eri!

767
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:51,470
What's that look?

768
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,170
Why are you so round like a cat?

769
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:59,170
No, no, no!

770
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:00,910
Wait!

771
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,150
No!

772
01:23:11,455 --> 01:23:25,670
Oh my gosh!

773
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:27,230
You are so nervous.

774
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,310
You are so nervous.

775
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:47,700
Camera, wake up.

776
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,740
Camera, wake up.

777
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:51,900
Come here.

778
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:57,180
Why do I have to put the camera down?

779
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:06,070
You are so cute.

780
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:09,210
Rin, why don't you try to sit on my lap?

781
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:13,810
Why are you hiding it?

782
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:16,890
Give it to me.

783
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:24,230
What is it?

784
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,950
Give me a kiss.

785
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,030
Give me a kiss.

786
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:34,751
Rin was cute Give me
a kiss No, I don't like it.

787
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,330
You have to do it with all your might.

788
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,050
Thank you.

789
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:56,990
You are so kind.

790
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:05,520
You are so cute.

791
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,420
Cats lick the whole body, right?

792
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:20,411
Do you want me to lick you?

793
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,260
I want you to lick me.

794
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:02,500
I'm going to put a mark on your face.

795
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,436
Are you going to get angry
if I put a mark on your face?

796
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,381
What?
Do you want me to put a mark on your face?

797
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:11,071
What do you think? Will you get
angry if I put a mark on your face?

798
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,300
What?

799
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,980
I'm going to put a mark on your face.

800
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:17,220
That's real.

801
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:26,320
I don't know.

802
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:40,980
I don't know.

803
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,540
One more.

804
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,960
I got it.

805
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:03,590
What should I do?

806
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,040
I told you to put it on.

807
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,560
You told me.

808
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:08,561
That's a proof.

809
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,200
That's a proof.

810
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:36,570
What's wrong?

811
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,500
I'm trying to help you.

812
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,300
Do you like me?

813
01:27:48,301 --> 01:27:49,540
You like me, don't you?

814
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:51,580
I don't like you.

815
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:55,620
I don't like you.

816
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,820
I just like you.

817
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,380
Do you?

818
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,200
No, I don't.

819
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:07,201
Well...

820
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,381
You're really eating with
all your might, aren't you?

821
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,070
I told you, didn't I?

822
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,170
You did.

823
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:27,010
I told you, didn't I?

824
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:28,130
You did.

825
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,390
You're eating with all
your might, aren't you?

826
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,920
You're so naughty.

827
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,691
You're always so energetic.

828
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:50,770
You're so happy.

829
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,670
Why do you tease me like that?

830
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,830
I'm not sure if I can do it.

831
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,860
I'll pet you.

832
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,600
I don't know if I can do it.

833
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,510
Hurry up.

834
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,300
Can I show my ears?

835
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,600
Do you like my ears?

836
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:08,740
Can I show my ears?

837
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:14,900
It feels good Are
you kidding me?

838
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:40,490
It feels good I'm sorry.

839
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,930
I'm sorry Wait a minute.

840
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,520
OK.

841
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,160
How do you say it?

842
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,131
If you say, let's take a picture of
the camera, that's what you say.

843
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,431
I'm in trouble What?

844
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:47,990
I'm in trouble with the reaction
I'm in trouble with the reaction.

845
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,410
Why?

846
01:31:49,815 --> 01:32:03,900
There are a lot of orders.

847
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,520
I can't see it.

848
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:25,260
Stop.

849
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:27,820
I can't see it.

850
01:33:28,045 --> 01:33:41,990
No, I wanna do it!

851
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:42,991
No, I wanna do it.

852
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:49,230
Do you wanna do it?

853
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:54,430
Yeah, I wanna do it but...

854
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,500
It's bright red.

855
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:15,250
I'll put a face mark.

856
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,230
I'll make it bright red.

857
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,250
I told you to do it.

858
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:22,670
I did.

859
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,600
I don't like it.

860
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,990
It's true.

861
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,470
Which one do you like?

862
01:34:58,835 --> 01:35:00,110
I like 0.2mm.

863
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,790
Do you like thin one?

864
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:04,630
Yes.

865
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:06,770
Say, hey, nya!

866
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:08,790
Say, hey, nya!

867
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,410
Thank you for putting it on.

868
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:13,130
Oh, it's written.

869
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:14,970
This is great.

870
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:16,690
It's a good logo.

871
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:21,270
Which one do you like?

872
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:22,650
Any one.

873
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:25,610
What's the difference?

874
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:43,170
It hurts.

875
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:44,470
It's not an AV.

876
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,210
It's not an AV.

877
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:48,590
Isn't this an AV?

878
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:49,911
This is not a music video, is it?

879
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,790
No, it's not.

880
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,690
It's done!

881
01:36:35,691 --> 01:36:36,691
I did it!

882
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:53,010
You're doing it right
How do you do it usually?

883
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,650
I do it like this.

884
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:30,711
I'm going to put it in You're
shaking it You don't need it.

885
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:54,180
Your tail is so big I'm just making
fun of you You don't need it.

886
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,280
He's trying to grab it.

887
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,470
What's wrong with you?

888
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:35,890
Does it feel good?

889
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:03,450
Does it feel good?

890
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,330
It's a little hard.

891
01:39:05,455 --> 01:39:07,050
You're cute.

892
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:14,310
I like this because it reacts a lot.

893
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:16,860
I'm going to sleep.

894
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:57,830
I'm going to sleep.

895
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:03,730
Show me your butt.

896
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,450

897
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:12,410
He's drooling Is he
drooling because he's a cat?

898
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,760
I'm going to sleep.

899
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:04,170
I like to take a rest.

900
01:42:40,140 --> 01:44:06,230
Oh, it's hard.

901
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:12,540

It's really hard.

904
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:09,300
You're so cute.

905
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,620
Why?

906
01:46:15,565 --> 01:46:17,300
I don't know.

907
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:36,930
You're making a face.

908
01:46:37,955 --> 01:46:43,230
It feels good.

909
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:45,370
It's dangerous from behind.

910
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:45,370
I'm so sick of it.

911
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:55,160

912
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:06,441
But... I'm sick of it.

920
01:51:00,030 --> 01:51:01,431

921
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,630
It's very intense.

922

Ouch!

934
01:53:56,190 --> 01:53:57,200
You're sweating a lot.

935
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:00,820
Ouch!

936
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:02,660

You're sweating a lot.

940
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:12,780
Oh, he's gone He's gone
again He flew all the way here.

941
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:14,820
He's so energetic

942
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,760
He's so excited.

943
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:21,620
I don't know if he'll get mad at me

944
01:54:21,870 --> 01:54:23,460
Don't worry.

945
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:29,500
I'll clean your ears.

946
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:37,610
I'll fix them Take
a deep breath.

947
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:59,350
Did you get it all out?

948
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,110
Did you get it all out?

949
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:07,790
Did you get it all out?

950
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:27,670
It was intense.

951
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:29,910
What?

952
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,090
It was intense.

953
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:34,550
Was it intense?

954
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:35,551
Did you like it?

955
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:40,510
It's intense.

956
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,020
I like it.

957
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,110
I don't like it.

958
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:49,290
You're eating a lot.

959
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:52,870
I told you so.

960
01:55:57,810 --> 01:55:58,810
Hey.

961
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,550
There's something over there.

962
01:56:04,551 --> 01:56:04,970
I have something like this.

963
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:07,730
No, no, no.

964
01:56:07,755 --> 01:56:10,350
Stop it.

965
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:13,210
It's too wide.

966
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:15,590
I found something like a jacuzzi.

967
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,010
Oh, yeah.

968
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:19,050
Let's go later.

969
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:21,310
I have to take a bath.

970
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,090
Later.

971
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:24,430
I don't want to move yet.

972
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:35,250
Why?

973
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:38,180
Did you feel good?

974
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:45,520
I won't show it to you
even if you get mad at me.

975
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:01,060
I won't use it.

976
01:57:02,590 --> 01:57:03,920
Don't touch it.

977
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:06,900
Will you get mad at me?

978
01:57:06,901 --> 01:57:07,901
What's that?

979
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:10,591
Are you going to summon it?

980
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:19,120
Don't worry.

981
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

982
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:58,850
Thank you.

983
01:59:00,305 --> 01:59:01,930
It feels good.

984
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:04,450
It's just right.

985
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:07,610
Thank you.

986
01:59:12,775 --> 01:59:14,910
It's warm, isn't it?

987
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:21,370
Thank you for dating with me today.

988
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:24,510
It's a celebration of our meeting.

989
01:59:26,510 --> 01:59:27,510
I'm embarrassed.

990
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:30,710
Let's have a toast.

991
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:33,310
Cheers!

992
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:40,770
It's very cold.

993
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:42,270
It's good, isn't it?

994
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:47,280
How was it today?

995
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:49,550
How was it today?

996
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:53,820
I want to go first.

997
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:54,960
Did you have fun?

998
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:56,420
Yes.

999
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:57,580
What else?

1000
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:00,440
It was fun.

1001
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:01,600
It was fun.

1002
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:03,360
What else?

1003
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:04,660
What else?

1004
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:07,100
You were cute.

1005
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,200
What?

1006
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:18,840
How was it?

1007
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:25,000
It's been a while since we
dated, so it was new to me.

1008
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,660
It's been a while.

1009
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,880
It was fun.

1010
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:34,580
But...

1011
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,420
We had a lot of sex.

1012
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:40,320
I don't know why, but...

1013
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:42,091
Because you're going to have sex.

1014
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:44,280
Well, that's...

1015
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,160
If I'm with him, I don't want to.

1016
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,020
It's been a while.

1017
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,060
Have you ever been in a relationship?

1018
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:57,260
Of course I have.

1019
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:58,820
I haven't.

1020
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:00,820
Do you have a boyfriend?

1021
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,060
No.

1022
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:07,480
You were a student, so
you don't have a boyfriend.

1023
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,761
Have you ever been on a school trip?

1024
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,980
I have.

1025
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:13,221
Have you ever seen a naked boy?

1026
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:14,160
Yes.

1027
02:01:14,161 --> 02:01:17,120
I'm not sure if it's a boy or
a girl, but I think it's a boy.

1028
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:24,160
I peeped.

1029
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:29,860
You peeped.

1030
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:31,740
What's wrong?

1031
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:36,760
I think I'm a little drunk.

1032
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:39,100
I'm drunk.

1033
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:48,160
It's true.

1034
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:50,760
It's amazing.

1035
02:01:52,330 --> 02:01:53,330
Blow on it.

1036
02:01:55,450 --> 02:01:58,160
It stood up!

1037
02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:06,630
It's romantic.

1038
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:21,830
It's unexpectedly romantic.

1039
02:02:21,831 --> 02:02:22,831
Let me see.

1040
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:28,410
Wow.

1041
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:34,430
It's fun.

1042
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:36,850
It's fun.

1043
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:54,840
Because I'm drunk.

1044
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,780
I'm drunk, so I'm feeling rich.

1045
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:12,010
Are you drunk?

1046
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:13,530
Not yet.

1047
02:03:13,531 --> 02:03:14,970
Why don't you get drunk?

1048
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:17,770
Should I drink more?

1049
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:44,790
Did you drink it?

1050
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:46,820
Yes, I did.

1051
02:04:09,295 --> 02:04:15,550
How is it?

1052
02:04:15,551 --> 02:04:16,551
What do you think?

1053
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:24,050
I love you so much.

1054
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:28,291
More than any other actress.

1055
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,390
Why are you saying that?

1056
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:36,970
Because you're a wonderful 13-year-old.

1057
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:40,950
I know, but...

1058
02:04:42,770 --> 02:04:44,290
Don't bother me.

1059
02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:48,830
I love you the most.

1060
02:04:48,831 --> 02:04:48,990
I love you.

1061
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:52,430
I love you the most today.

1062
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:54,750
I love you the most all the time.

1063
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:57,550
Don't say such a thing.

1064
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:02,690
I put a kiss mark on my lips.

1065
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:04,230
What's wrong with you?

1066
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:06,380
I don't know.

1067
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:07,790
If you get angry at me on the set,

1068
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:09,430
I'll say,

1069
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:11,250
I put a kiss mark on my lips.

1070
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:15,790
I don't know.

1071
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,050
You're drunk, aren't you?

1072
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:22,430
I can't help it because I'm drunk.

1073
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:23,710
You can't see it, can you?

1074
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:25,370
I can see it.

1075
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:26,210
You can't see it?

1076
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:27,770
It's okay.

1077
02:05:29,870 --> 02:05:31,790
There are people who
live in this kind of world.

1078
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:39,570
I can't see it.

1079
02:05:45,605 --> 02:05:46,350
Why are you hiding it?

1080
02:05:46,351 --> 02:05:47,351
I'm sorry.

1081
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,050
I can't stop kissing you.

1082
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:49,150
Drink more.

1083
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:53,590
Can I drink more?

1084
02:07:53,591 --> 02:07:54,591
Are you okay?

1085
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:25,940
Are you standing up already?

1086
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:28,900
I'm going to kiss you.

1087
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,600
You're wearing a swimsuit.

1088
02:08:38,270 --> 02:08:39,200
It's hard.

1089
02:08:39,201 --> 02:08:40,620
You don't like it, do you?

1090
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:47,681
Why do you say such a thing?

1091
02:08:49,380 --> 02:09:16,210
Why do I say such a thing?

1092
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,910
Your reaction is cute.

1093
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:30,500
What?

1094
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:32,981
Don't do that. You'll get angry.

1095
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:35,150
No, I won't.

1096
02:09:35,615 --> 02:09:36,930
Are you serious?

1097
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:41,470
I don't care if you get mad at me.

1098
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:41,930
Just one.

1099
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:43,330
Just one?

1100
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:44,670
Which one?

1101
02:09:45,205 --> 02:09:46,205
This one.

1102
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:48,390
I don't want it.

1103
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:49,910
I don't want it.

1104
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:51,370
You don't want it?

1105
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:52,890
Then try it on me.

1106
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:54,170
No.

1107
02:09:54,270 --> 02:09:54,870
Why?

1108
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:55,550
No.

1109
02:09:55,610 --> 02:09:55,970
Why?

1110
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:56,930
You'll get mad at me.

1111
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:58,090
Why? It's the same.

1112
02:09:58,170 --> 02:09:59,170
No.

1113
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:00,610
I'm your lover today.

1114
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:01,150
No.

1115
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:02,490
Try it on me.

1116
02:10:02,570 --> 02:10:03,570
No.

1117
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:04,850
Why?

1118
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:08,510
Why are you rubbing it on my face?

1119
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:10,970
Put it on my face.

1120
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:18,770
If you put it on my face,
I'll put it on your face.

1121
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:21,370
Is that a good thing?

1122
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:24,090
No, it's not.

1123
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:28,570
Don't be stupid.

1124
02:10:29,970 --> 02:10:30,970
I'm not stupid.

1125
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,220
What's that?

1126
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:43,030
Are you trying to take a bath?

1127
02:11:43,775 --> 02:11:44,990
You're taking a bath.

1128
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:48,070
You're a playboy.

1129
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:53,670
No, I don't want to.

1130
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:54,810
No, I don't want to.

1131
02:11:54,811 --> 02:11:55,811
What's wrong with you?

1132
02:12:15,210 --> 02:12:16,550
Don't look at me.

1133
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:19,330
Don't look at me.

1134
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:21,570
I don't want to.

1135
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:23,610
I'm not looking at you.

1136
02:12:27,850 --> 02:12:28,850
I'm not looking at you.

1137
02:12:43,805 --> 02:12:45,040
This is outside, isn't it?

1138
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:47,580
You have to be careful with your voice.

1139
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:48,240
You have to be careful with your voice.

1140
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:49,580
I can't do it.

1141
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:51,880
I'll do it for you.

1142
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:07,300
You can hear the outside voice,

1143
02:13:07,890 --> 02:13:09,331
but you can't hear the inside voice.

1144
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:10,920
That's right.

1145
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:12,480
That's right.

1146
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:14,360
Look.

1147
02:13:16,830 --> 02:13:17,830
I can hear a lot.

1148
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:39,950
Let's do it.

1149
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,120
No, no.

1150
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:45,130
Don't do it.

1151
02:13:46,950 --> 02:13:48,130
Get out.

1152
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:53,670
No, no, no.

1153
02:13:54,690 --> 02:14:15,490
Mommmm~~

1154
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:19,810
No, no.

1155
02:14:20,110 --> 02:14:22,630
No, not like that.

1156
02:14:22,631 --> 02:14:23,631
Like this.

1157
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:29,170
You're making a loud noise.

1158
02:14:30,210 --> 02:14:31,230
I'm not.

1159
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:51,610
You like to be petted.

1160
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:16,800
Ouch!

1161
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:20,130
You have a stomachache. Are you okay?

1162
02:15:21,730 --> 02:15:22,770
I'm patient.

1163
02:15:23,230 --> 02:15:24,250
You are patient.

1164
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:57,860
I'm patient.

1165
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:04,120
You can't stand it anymore.

1166
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:05,540
Sit down.

1167
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:30,070
It's okay. You can sit down.

1168
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:31,170
What do you mean?

1169
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:32,390
You can go inside.

1170
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:39,690
I wanted to try it.

1171
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:48,230
Isn't it hard?

1172
02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:34,950
It's not fair.

1173
02:17:40,355 --> 02:17:42,590
There are many people
who are better than me.

1174
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:23,590
What are you doing?

1175
02:18:25,410 --> 02:18:33,790
What are you doing?

1176
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:57,660
Do you like soy sauce?

1177
02:18:57,985 --> 02:18:59,070
I love you.

1178
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:04,190
I love you.

1179
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:05,810
I love you.

1180
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:25,490
Stop it.

1181
02:19:27,130 --> 02:19:28,570
I can't do it anymore.

1182
02:19:36,130 --> 02:19:37,130
Don't make a sound.

1183
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:45,140
Can't you see outside?

1184
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:46,900
Yes, I can.

1185
02:19:48,310 --> 02:19:49,310
Really?

1186
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:50,030
Yes, I can.

1187
02:19:50,470 --> 02:19:51,470
Isn't it amazing?

1188
02:19:53,130 --> 02:19:54,430
It's shining.

1189
02:19:56,310 --> 02:19:58,350
The night view outside is shining.

1190
02:19:58,351 --> 02:19:59,351
It's a beautiful view.

1191
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:03,420
Put it in slowly.

1192
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,080
I can't do it.

1193
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:34,460
You can't?

1194
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:37,400
He says he can't do it.

1195
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:41,080
He says he can't do it.

1196
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:06,970
No, no, no, no, no.

1197
02:22:14,490 --> 02:22:15,990
You are so cute.

1198
02:22:16,650 --> 02:22:17,650
She loves you.

1199
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:27,430
She loves you so much.

1200
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:35,460
I want to be comfortable with you.

1201
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:38,460
I can't.

1202
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,520
It's so hot.

1203
02:23:33,585 --> 02:24:11,790
Help me.

1204
02:26:27,565 --> 02:28:04,020
Do you want to drink from the back?

1205
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,200
It's so hot.

1206
02:30:03,201 --> 02:30:42,100
Oh, it's so wet.

1207
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:44,840
It's so wet.

1208
02:31:06,690 --> 02:31:08,260
Does it tickle?

1209
02:31:08,625 --> 02:31:09,680
Yes, it does.

1210
02:31:09,681 --> 02:31:10,681
Did you just say that?

1211
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:20,300
Did you feel good?

1212
02:31:22,510 --> 02:31:23,510
I felt so good.

1213
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:34,580
What are you going to do after this?

1214
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:37,520
What should I do?

1215
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:40,680
Do you want to stay here?

1216
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,420
I don't know.

1217
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:47,100
Because it's a very fun hotel.

1218
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:49,540
Tomorrow.

1219
02:31:50,140 --> 02:31:51,140
Tomorrow?

1220
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:52,640
Let's make it in time.

1221
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:55,620
For the shooting?

1222
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:56,660
Yes.

1223
02:31:57,970 --> 02:32:00,090
Even if we don't make it in
time, you won't blame me?

1224
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:01,120
I won't.

1225
02:32:01,950 --> 02:32:02,860
I won't.

1226
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:03,920
Then, go away.

1227
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:07,420
Let's stay here.

1228
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:26,080
What do you think?

1229
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:35,310
What do you think?

1230
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:35,470
What do you think?

1231
02:32:35,471 --> 02:32:36,471
Oh no!

1232
02:32:36,650 --> 02:32:37,750
I was wrong!

1233
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:39,250
I was wrong!

1234
02:32:39,710 --> 02:32:40,710
Who was it?

1235
02:32:41,350 --> 02:32:42,450
Who was it?

1236
02:32:42,451 --> 02:32:44,690
I don't know.

1237
02:32:45,290 --> 02:32:46,290
I don't know.

1238
02:32:52,920 --> 02:33:02,020
I don't know.
