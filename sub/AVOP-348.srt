1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Where do you want to go?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oze is Oze.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oze? Where is Oze?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I thought so too.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Bunma?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Don't you want to go to Shichitai?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't you want to go to Shichitai?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Kyoto is better.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If it's autumn.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Is it a rental car for 8 people?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't want to drive.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't want to drive.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't want to drive.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He said he didn't like hot springs.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He is very shy.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He doesn't want to show his skin.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't have skin.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't have skin.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He doesn't want to show his skin to women.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I searched on the Internet.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's hard to drive, so I'll do my best and go to Kyushu.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is this?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Airplane.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, it's an airplane.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've only been on an airplane once.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to go on an airplane.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Circulation trip.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is this?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Video?

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What kind of video?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Interesting video.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What is this?

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What is this?

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What is this?

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, that's right.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, that's right.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's right.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What is this?

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What was this?

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is a video that was on Sora's computer.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's on the screen.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What is this video?

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a 4-person video.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What was it called?

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
A file...

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Maruhi...

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Maruhi?

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Maruhi circle trip.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was a trip to Japan in 2012.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The air is so fresh.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to open it, but I can't.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The air is so fresh.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It smells good.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I took out the camera.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We're shooting it every year.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Everyone is showing cute faces.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Memories.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I want to do a BBQ.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
BBQ.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm preparing it.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you bring it?

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Of course.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to play a game.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's introduce ourselves one by one.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's take a selfie.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The mountains are beautiful.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The mountains as far as you can see.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's introduce ourselves.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm Nonoka.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm Nomukki.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm Sora.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you for your hard work.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Congratulations.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm Yuna.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you nervous?

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm a little nervous.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have to put it in early.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm the type who doesn't get excited.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm scared.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's get excited.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm still shaking.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm shaking like this.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm a strawberry.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm a strawberry.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going out today.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're going to drink a little bit at a time.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's have a drink together.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it fun?

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's nice to have two beautiful girls together.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want four of you.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you shooting?

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They are taking pictures of us.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They are men.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They are light.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They are light.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They are drinking.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They are rampaging.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't you have a boyfriend?

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You are worried.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't you have a boyfriend?

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They are cute.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Did you say it?

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, I did.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're so serious.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I said it.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm scared if someone gets mad at me.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you angry?

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't think I'll get caught.

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Did you say it?

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I said it.

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What did you say?

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I said it.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Did you say it in English?

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, I didn't.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's bad.

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I said, go on a trip.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We're not like men.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We don't look like men.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't say it because I thought I'd get caught.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't think I'll get caught.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
As expected of Parisians.

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want to get in the car!

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want to drink sake!

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I hate alcohol!

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want to eat meat.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to eat meat.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I want to eat strawberries.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't want to eat strawberries.

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to eat Rattle.

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I love Rattle.

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to eat Rattle.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to eat mango.

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I want to eat mango.

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to eat sausages.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want a sausage

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There are 4 of them

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Today, we're eating in a size-cub

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wait, it's not good

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's going to spill

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like this

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tora-chan's up

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Up

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Up

151
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Up

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ah, it's cool

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Are you drunk?

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you drunk?

155
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How do you feel when you're drunk?

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I feel good

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I feel better than now

158
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're too high

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're gonna disappear

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I do what I want

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's do what we want

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What do you want to do?

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to do what I want to do

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you want to do?

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Me?

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want to get more excited than usual

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Really?

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I've never seen it

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I feel like I can drink

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll drink today

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I have to drink today

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you okay?

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll drink

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The best pension

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're waiting for you.

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How did Misa drink?

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Misa...

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Can you drink a little?

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Her face is getting red.

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a strawberry.

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Her face is turning into a strawberry.

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Misa is always cute.

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think I can talk more than now.

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She's talking more than usual.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She's getting excited.

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She's like a light river.

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She gets lighter, right?

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like a light rafting.

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I can talk more when I drink.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can't talk because I'm left-handed.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What do you do when you go?

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm looking forward to it.

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't tell me.

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's a rafting.

196
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What do you start with?

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm hunting.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm looking forward to it.

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm looking forward to it.

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm looking forward to it.

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
One is already in the local area.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's a local area.

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's so fast.

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's so fast.

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's so fast.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's right next to my house.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's so fast.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's have a BBQ.

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm hungry.

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
BBQ.

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
BBQ.

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BBQ BBQ

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think it's a gathering of the circle.

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's not like that.

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It looks like it's going to be fun.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I know.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Self-introduction.

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's this?

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's something we said the other day.

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We were like, we'll be back soon.

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Something like that?

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Something like Maruizawa will be coming back soon.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't hear anything.

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who is this?

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Who is the person who was filming this?

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's burning!

227
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll buy you a strawberry juice.

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What do you want to drink?

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I want a strawberry juice.

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Strawberry?

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is really good.

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are you drinking?

233
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Beer.

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's cool.

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Beer for now.

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What about you, Hime?

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Pitch is fast.

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's coming.

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's coming.

240
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's have a toast.

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's have a toast.

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I thought you were already drunk.

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's have a toast.

244
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sora-chan, Sora-chan.

245
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sora-chan will prepare it soon.

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's have a toast.

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's have a toast.

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sora-chan, please give it to Sora-chan.

249
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll give it to you.

250
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's ready.

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's have a toast.

252
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you going to do?

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's have a toast to our body.

254
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Cheers!

255
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Cheers!

256
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Take a video!

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000

Cheers!

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Cheers to the calories!

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is delicious!

262
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Have a bite!

263
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Have a bite!

264
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Have a bite!

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll post this on social media later.

266
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There was a sausage.

267
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll post it later.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I want to eat it.

269
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Please give us a thumbs up.

270
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I want to take a picture of this scene.

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you very much.

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll take a picture of this.

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll take a picture of this.

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll bring more.

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you very much.

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is the wall of light-hearted people.

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the wall of light-hearted people.

278
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is the wall of light-hearted people.

279
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I like it.

280
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Is it good?

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's see your reaction.

282
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is it good?

283
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's good.

284
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's cute.

285
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Is it good?

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's good.

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Is it good?

288
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The cheese is good.

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The cheese is good.

290
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's good.

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's not easy to taste the grilled fish.

292
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's true.

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's really hard to taste.

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What's your specialty?

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
My specialty is rice.

296
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I like rice.

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Really?

298
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's good.

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wow.

300
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's good.

301
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's good.

302
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's leaking.

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's leaking.

304
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is delicious.

305
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is it delicious?

306
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There is no strawberry.

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to go to pick cherry blossoms.

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to go to pick cherry blossoms.

309
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is it hot?

310
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Hold it here.

311
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's hot.

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's hot.

313
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's hot.

314
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is it hot?

315
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's hot.

316
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you want me to bite you?

317
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you bite me, I'll bite you.

318
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It hurts.

319
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's hot.

320
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's hot.

321
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't bite me.

322
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It hurts.

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't bite me.

324
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I want to bite you.

325
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm tired.

326
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you okay?

327
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hime, meat.

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's hot.

329
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I like the way you spread your legs.

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's empty.

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's empty.

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's empty.

333
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's empty.

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Are you holding it?

335
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Thank you.

336
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's a Turkey Lasso.

337
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you.

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

339
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's fun today.

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's fun.

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's good.

342
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't drink too much.

343
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I got it.

344
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's okay.

345
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's okay.

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's better to drink here.

347
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's good.

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's too hot.

349
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's burnt.

350
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's burnt.

351
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's burning.

352
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's burning.

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's hot.

354
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's hot.

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't push it.

356
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't push it.

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Watch out.

358
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Watch out.

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Watch out.

360
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's hot.

361
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's really hot.

362
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's really hot.

363
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What a bad boy.

364
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's hot.

365
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What kind of eating style are you doing, captain?

366
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm thinking of spilling the sauce.

367
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's hot.

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh no.

369
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm spilling the sauce.

370
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm spilling the sauce.

371
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You should eat it when it spills.

372
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's too new.

373
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's how you eat it.

374
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh.

375
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh.

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh.

377
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, yes.

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh.

379
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Great.

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is it okay?

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's a white one.

382
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Thank you.

383
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Is it good?

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's good.

385
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's good.

386
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you.

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It has strong female power.

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's take a picture together.

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's take a picture together.

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's in the picture.

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's in the picture.

392
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yay!

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you.

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yay!

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yay!

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yay!

397
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was thinking, but this salad looks like it's going to be a bad one.

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What?

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Aren't you drinking too much?

400
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, it's not like that.

401
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I know, I know.

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What is it?

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I added a special sauce.

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you add something?

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I just added it.

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Really?

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't drink too much.

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I understand.

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Thank you.

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Thank you.

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's delicious.

412
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why are you so kind?

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know.

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why are you touching it?

415
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why are you touching it?

416
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is it delicious?

417
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's delicious.

418
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't eat it?

419
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're so funny.

420
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hime is so erotic.

421
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm jealous.

422
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm jealous.

423
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then, I'll eat it in your place.

424
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It looks fun.

425
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's good for BBQ, isn't it?

426
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's good.

427
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's good for BBQ in autumn.

428
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's amazing.

429
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm hungry.

430
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He's eating so much.

431
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I know.

432
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He's pretty handsome.

433
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I know.

434
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I haven't heard of him.

435
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He's good.

436
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He's good.

437
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He doesn't want to be in front of me.

438
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He doesn't drink.

439
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He drinks a lot.

440
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He drinks a lot.

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He says he drinks a lot.

442
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Does he still drink?

443
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He might get cold in the morning.

444
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He wasn't in a good mood.

445
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
My legs are...

446
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's drink inside.

447
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, yeah.

448
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's go.

449
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's go.

450
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No, you don't have to do anything.

451
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't have to do anything.

452
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Just me.

453
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're going to get burned.

454
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's clean up properly.

455
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's clean up properly.

456
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Can I go in?

457
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Can you clean it up?

458
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Are you okay?

459
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Your face is red.

460
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's okay.

461
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Your face is red.

462
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Please take care of her.

465
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Thank you.

466
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you okay?

467
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm okay.

468
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You can't say that.

469
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're red.

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're cute.

471
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You can do it.

472
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can do it.

473
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can do it.

474
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm okay.

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm okay.

476
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm okay.

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm okay.

478
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm okay.

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Be careful.

480
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How much do you want to drink?

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I want to drink.

482
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's so cute.

483
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It was fun.

484
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There are still many more.

485
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There are still many more.

486
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There are still many more.

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There are still many more.

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There are still many more.

489
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Is it okay?

490
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's okay.

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What about strawberry?

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's okay.

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm not sure.

494
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm not sure.

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't like it.

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's play a game.

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Let's play a game.

498
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is this?

499
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm going.

500
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you see a monkey on Amazon, who will you beat?

501
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
How to beat?

502
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
If you see a monkey on Amazon, who will you beat?

503
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Sorry sorry.

504
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh!

505
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh!

506
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
One hit.

507
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh!

508
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh!

509
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Bap Bap.

510
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is Bap, right?

511
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Bap Bap.

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I can't beat my own Oppa anymore.

513
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh!

514
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh!

515
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh!

516
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh!

517
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh!

518
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh!

519
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh!

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh!

521
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh!

522
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh!

523
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh!

524
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh!

525
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh!

526
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh!

527
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh!

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh!

529
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yay!

530
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yay!

531
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Good luck!

532
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Good luck!

533
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yay!

534
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good luck!

535
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want to drink it!

536
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I want to drink it!

537
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I want to drink it!

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I want to drink it!

539
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Are you ready?

540
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes, I'm ready.

541
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There are five left.

542
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I think they are coming.

543
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes, they are coming!

544
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yay!

545
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yay!

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's done.

547
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
4 more to go.

548
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How many?

549
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
3 more.

550
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's coming.

551
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hime-chan.

552
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
2 more to go.

553
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's 1 out of 2.

554
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hime-chan has it.

555
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hime-chan has it.

556
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
If you don't drink it, you can drink 2 more.

557
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm scared.

558
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is it.

559
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
1 more to go.

560
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's go to the park.

561
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This guy is a judge.

562
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's it.

563
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ready first.

564
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ready first.

565
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why is it like this?

566
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
To the back.

567
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's a mess.

568
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a crisis.

569
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't understand.

570
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's a crisis.

571
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think it's good.

572
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think it's good.

573
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Thank you.

574
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah.

575
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's still going up to the end.

576
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think I have it.

577
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Who is it?

578
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Who is it?

579
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What are you holding?

580
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm holding it.

581
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah.

582
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Are you okay?

583
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you okay?

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Give me a word.

585
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Can you still drink?

586
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I can drink.

587
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wait a minute.

588
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I can still drink.

589
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't like Pocky.

590
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Let's do it together.

591
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's do it together.

592
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Wait a minute.

593
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's dangerous.

594
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Are you okay?

595
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What about the rest?

596
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Did you eat it?

597
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I ate it.

598
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Where should I put it?

599
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This is scary.

600
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's hard to put it on.

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He's putting his life on the line.

602
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, he dropped it.

603
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He dropped it.

604
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There's a tear.

605
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What is it?

606
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It looks like he's going to cry.

607
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What is it?

608
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He's going to scream.

609
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's impossible even if you think about it.

610
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't think it's possible.

611
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's impossible.

612
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's impossible.

613
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In the middle.

614
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh my god!

615
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What happened?

616
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There's a ghost.

617
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There's a ghost.

618
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There's a ghost.

619
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's a ghost.

620
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait a minute.

621
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There's a ghost.

622
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There's only one ghost.

623
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's a ghost.

624
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Can't you see us?

625
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Why are you here?

626
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh my god!

627
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh my god!

628
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, wait a minute.

629
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's almost over.

630
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
One game is over.

631
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This side is bad.

632
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This side is bad.

633
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What did you do?

634
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a game.

635
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's amazing.

636
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What should I do?

637
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You can put it anywhere.

638
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You can put it anywhere.

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Ok,ok,ok.

640
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Ohhhh.

641
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
She swallowed it.

642
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
She swallowed it with her mouth.

643
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I didn't swallow it.

644
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No,no,no.

645
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh,no,no.

646
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It became soft.

647
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's good.

648
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's good.

649
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh,no,no.

650
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's open.

651
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Next.

652
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I want to open it.

653
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll bring it.

654
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What do you want to drink?

655
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I want something with alcohol in it.

656
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Everyone is good.

657
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Isn't it amazing?

658
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's amazing. It's very high level.

659
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I can't drink anymore.

660
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is really difficult.

661
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I can't drink anymore.

662
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I can't drink anymore.

663
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What? What? What?

664
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What is this?

665
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Ahhhhhhh!

666
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ahhhhhhh!

667
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Ahhhhhhh!

668
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
MisaMisa!

669
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
MisaMisa!

670
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
MisaMisa!

671
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
MisaMisa! This is a Bap!

672
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Bap!

673
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's not on!

674
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
MisaMisa!

675
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What?

676
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Bap! Bap!

677
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Up! Up!

678
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Up! Up!

679
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh, it's a waki.

680
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
No, no, it's dirty.

681
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's dirty.

682
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Cheers!

683
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Cheers!

684
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Everyone, drink.

685
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Cheers!

686
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's weak.

687
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's weak. I'll release it.

688
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's play a game.

689
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If you don't feel like it, tell me.

690
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's play a game.

691
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Don't drink too much.

692
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You can drink the cake.

693
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
No, no, no.

694
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's okay.

695
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm going to break it.

696
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's okay.

697
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll take care of it.

698
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay.

699
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Who's going to draw?

700
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm going to draw Sora-chan.

701
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's a chance.

702
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Please get excited.

703
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's time.

704
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Do it.

705
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's a beauty.

706
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's a weak body part.

707
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Where is it?

708
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What is this?

709
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Where is it?

710
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's cute.

711
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Here?

712
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Princess Chan.

713
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I want to drink a sexy drink.

714
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Don't you want to drink a lot?

715
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I want to drink a sexy drink.

716
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Who do you want to drink a sexy drink to?

717
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This way.

718
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Don't get wet.

719
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Left and right.

720
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Sexy!

721
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's like Misamisa is sexy.

722
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Misamisa is sexy.

723
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But there's something good about this.

724
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It looks sexy.

725
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It looks sexy.

726
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Sexy.

727
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It looks sexy.

728
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Sexy.

729
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's sexy.

730
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The bell is long.

731
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The bell is long, isn't it?

732
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I want to be a can.

733
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Long tongue.

734
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh, I got it.

735
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I drank it.

736
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I drank it.

737
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I want to see Sora-chan's.

738
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Makorin knows.

739
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Makorin is cute.

740
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's good, it's good.

741
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's good, it's good.

742
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's good.

743
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The game is still in the middle of the game.

744
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Did you pull it?

745
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I didn't pull it.

746
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I pulled it.

747
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's really long.

748
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Is it okay?

749
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The tongue is long.

750
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

751
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Did you cut it too long?

752
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
There's something amazing.

753
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What is it?

754
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The first experience will be announced someday.

755
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Aren't you guys girls?

756
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There are a lot of girls.

757
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You're boyfriends.

758
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Are you girls?

759
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I want to say that I'm a girl.

760
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
When I was a girl, I was a strawberry.

761
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You're good at talking.

762
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Your head is terrible.

763
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
When I was a strawberry.

764
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I was 14 years old at that time.

765
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
When I was in the second grade of junior high school.

766
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I was in the second grade of junior high school.

767
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I was in the second grade of junior high school.

768
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You're a girl.

769
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No, no. I'm 17 years old forever. I'm in the 2nd grade.

770
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm so tired.

771
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You are a middle school student.

772
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not a teacher.

773
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You are not a teacher.

774
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You are not a teacher.

775
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
A teacher with her neighbor?

776
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Who is it with?

777
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Who is it with?

778
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I want to hear it.

779
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Who is it?

780
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Who is it?

781
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Who is it?

782
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Teacher, right?

783
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Let's hug each other.

784
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
This is the most embarrassing game I've ever played.

785
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What is it?

786
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Hime-chan, you must be surprised.

787
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm not.

788
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm not.

789
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Is there something embarrassing?

790
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm sure there is.

791
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What is it?

792
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
In the car.

793
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What?

794
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's not a car.

795
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Tissue?

796
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Tissue?

797
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Tissue?

798
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I don't need tissue.

799
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Is there a place with tissue?

800
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No.

801
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Really?

802
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It wasn't a play, it was during the day off.

803
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
During the day off?

804
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What was that?

805
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
During the winter.

806
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It was cold during the winter.

807
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It was cold.

808
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The toilet was the limit.

809
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The toilet was the limit.

810
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
What was that?

811
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Did you pee?

812
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I got it while I was walking.

813
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You didn't notice?

814
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Let's do it.

815
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I want to see who's the winner.

816
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I want to see who's the winner.

817
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What are you doing?

818
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm doing it.

819
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Are you excited?

820
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Are you having fun?

821
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Carly's here.

822
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's like a club.

823
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's play a game.

824
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Let's do it until the last minute.

825
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Who's going to do it?

826
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll do it.

827
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'll do it.

828
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Please do it.

829
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'll do it.

830
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You're shooting a video.

831
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll do it.

832
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Leave it to me.

833
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll do it.

834
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll do it.

835
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll do it.

836
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'll do it.

837
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Go!

838
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Just a little bit more.

839
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Just a little bit more.

840
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
His face is so annoying.

841
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
His face is so annoying.

842
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
He's getting angry at his boyfriend.

843
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, he's getting angry at his boyfriend.

844
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
He's getting angry at his boyfriend.

845
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's eat.

846
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What are you talking about?

847
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Punchline.

848
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Because I can see it.

849
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Punchline.

850
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Look at this.

851
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It's a cave.

852
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Lavender color.

853
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Lavender.

854
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Lavender.

855
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Karuizawa is conscious.

856
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Pension color.

857
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Pension color.

858
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's a little dusty.

859
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What is it?

860
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Pension color.

861
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
This is hot.

862
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Is this okay?

863
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's okay.

864
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's okay.

865
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's about to burst.

866
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, it's from the pension.

867
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What happened?

868
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's from the pension.

869
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Is this a fake?

870
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's not a fake.

871
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's from the pension.

872
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I can see it.

873
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's a fake.

874
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No?

875
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's a yutose, isn't it?

876
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Look at this.

877
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's a pants.

878
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's a big deal.

879
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What?

880
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Wait a minute.

881
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Let's check.

882
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Check. Check.

883
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The hair.

884
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The hair.

885
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Check. Check.

886
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm going to check the hair.

887
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The hair hurts.

888
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The hair hurts.

889
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Check. Check.

890
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What's the game?

891
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What's the game?

892
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's like a cross-section.

893
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I want to see your underwear.

894
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I want to see your underwear.

895
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Do you want to see my underwear?

896
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Your underwear and swimsuit are the same, right?

897
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They are the same.

898
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Wait, wait.

899
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

900
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Wait, wait, wait.

901
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What's that?

902
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Emerald!

903
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Emerald Green!

904
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Emerald Green!

905
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Emerald Green!

906
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Emerald Green!

907
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Sora-chan!

908
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Sora-chan!

909
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh, the best Emerald!

910
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh no!

911
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh no!

912
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh no!

913
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh no!

914
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh no!

915
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh no!

916
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh no!

917
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Welcome!

918
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Welcome!

919
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Welcome!

920
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Welcome!

921
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Welcome!

922
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Wow!

923
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
He has a beard!

924
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Why did you take it?

925
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's in your hand.

926
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's in your hand.

927
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Welcome.

928
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Thank you very much.

929
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Thank you very much.

930
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you very much.

931
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Thank you very much.

932
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Thank you very much.

933
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Are you OK?

934
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm OK.

935
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
OK.

936
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The boobs are big.

937
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The boobs are big.

938
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You can do it.

939
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You are so soft.

940
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You are so soft.

941
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You are so soft.

942
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You are so soft.

943
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm surprised.

944
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's a game.

945
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
What is game?

946
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Let's have fun.

947
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's drink before that.

948
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Let's drink.

949
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Let's drink from the outside.

950
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't want to drink.

951
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't want to drink.

952
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't want to drink.

953
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't want to drink.

954
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Why?

955
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Will he come?

956
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
His face is so cute.

957
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
His face is so cute?

958
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
His face is so cute.

959
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,660
You can do it, you can do it, you can do it

960
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,860
Isn't it finally that?

961
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,220
Finally, the last one

962
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,460
Oh, it's bad

963
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
That's right

964
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,620
There is no one left

965
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,100
Then, Hime is left, Hime is left

966
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,540
Is that okay? Thank you

967
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,780
Thank you

968
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,380
Yay, I did it

969
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,220
I'm saying I did it

970
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
It's fast, it's fast

971
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,820
Kink, Kink, Kink is fast at making up stories

972
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,420
Where is Kink? Who is Kink?

973
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,780
Can you do it, Santa?

974
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,300
Misa-chan, I wanted to experience something like this

975
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Who is it?

976
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Who is it?

977
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Who is it?

978
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
It's Jun-kun.

979
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Who is it?

980
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Who is it?

981
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
It's Osamu.

982
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300
It's Osamu.

983
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Osamu is a little young.

984
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Don't pretend like that.

985
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Stop it.

986
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300
I don't know the number.

987
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
I don't know the number.

988
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
It's Nono.

989
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
What is it?

990
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
What is it?

991
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:11,300
The king licks the weak point of No. 7.

992
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
He's dancing.

993
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,300
The weak point of No. 7.

994
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
The king licks the weak point of No. 7.

995
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Who is No. 7?

996
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Who is No. 7?

997
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Who is No. 7?

998
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Yes, that's right.

999
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Who is No. 7?

1000
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,300
I'm sure you peeped at me.

1001
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,300
I'm sure you peeped at me.

1002
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Please show me your weakness.

1003
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
You still peeped at me.

1004
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
You still peeped at me.

1005
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
You're nervous, aren't you?

1006
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Why?

1007
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Your face is stiff.

1008
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
What?

1009
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
Oh no.

1010
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Oh no.

1011
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
Me too, me too.

1012
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
I'm watching you.

1013
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Me too, me too.

1014
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Why did you start here?

1015
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,300
What?

1016
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
You're drunk.

1017
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,300
I'm drunk too.

1018
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,300
I'm responsible for the group.

1019
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,300
You're responsible for the group.

1020
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,300
I'm responsible for the group.

1021
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,300
I want it.

1022
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
What?

1023
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
What's this?

1024
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
What's this?

1025
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Your ears are weak.

1026
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Your ears are weak?

1027
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
Your ears are weak?

1028
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Everyone plays alone too much.

1029
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm a king now.

1030
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Something is starting.

1031
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Something is starting.

1032
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
It's a game.

1033
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,300
You can't play.

1034
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
You were doing something here too.

1035
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
I couldn't see it from behind.

1036
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
You can't play.

1037
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,300
Finally, I found out.

1038
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Number 4, please.

1039
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
Number 4, please.

1040
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Number 6?

1041
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,300
It's a girl group?

1042
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,300
It's embarrassing.

1043
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
It's a girl group.

1044
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
It's a girl group.

1045
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
It's a girl group.

1046
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
The order changed.

1047
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,300
The order changed.

1048
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
That's how you eat a barbecue, isn't it?

1049
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
That's how you eat a barbecue.

1050
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
You can't get sauce on it.

1051
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,300
No, no.

1052
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
It's cool.

1053
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
I couldn't eat chocolate at all.

1054
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
It's impossible.

1055
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
It's impossible.

1056
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
It's amazing.

1057
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
That's too much!

1058
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,300
I'm just going to scream!

1059
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,300
I'm the king now, so you all know that, right?

1060
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
No, we don't!

1061
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
We know that's bad.

1062
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,300
No, we don't!

1063
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
Well, it doesn't matter what the king says.

1064
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,300
It doesn't matter if it's a number.

1065
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
It doesn't matter if it's a number.

1066
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Hime-chan's relationship is important.

1067
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,300
I want to kiss all the girls.

1068
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Really?

1069
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
I want to kiss the king.

1070
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
All of them.

1071
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,300
I want to have a boyfriend.

1072
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
No, no, no.

1073
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Isn't he stronger than his boyfriend?

1074
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
No, no, no.

1075
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
No, no, no.

1076
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,300
It's a big kiss.

1077
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
No, no, no.

1078
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
I want to have a boyfriend.

1079
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Is he stronger than his boyfriend?

1080
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
No, no, no.

1081
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,300
No, no, no.

1082
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
No, no, no.

1083
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
No, no, no.

1084
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,300
It can't be helped.

1085
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
If it's dead, kiss it.

1086
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Isn't it soft?

1087
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Isn't it soft?

1088
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
It's too soft.

1089
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
It's okay.

1090
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
It's too soft.

1091
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Amazing.

1092
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Amazing.

1093
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Danger!

1094
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,300
What does it taste like?

1095
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,300
I don't know.

1096
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
What does it taste like?

1097
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
I don't know.

1098
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
I'm the king.

1099
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
It's good.

1100
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Danger!

1101
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
No!

1102
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
No!

1103
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Let's show them.

1104
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
Danger!

1105
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,300
No!

1106
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Danger!

1107
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Why?

1108
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
You are going to get drunk.

1109
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
Go, go.

1110
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
Give me your tongue.

1111
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
How was it?

1112
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,300
It was delicious.

1113
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
How was it?

1114
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
It was delicious.

1115
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,300
It was delicious.

1116
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,300
Kalbippi.

1117
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
Oh, no.

1118
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
Are you okay?

1119
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,300
Look, look.

1120
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Sawa-chan is here.

1121
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Look.

1122
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Sara, Sara.

1123
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Give me your tongue.

1124
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Why?

1125
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Sara, Sara.

1126
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Give me your tongue.

1127
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Give me your tongue.

1128
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
I'm drunk.

1129
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
More, more, more.

1130
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,300
Who is it?

1131
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
Who is it?

1132
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,300
Don't do that.

1133
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,300
Go, go, go, go.

1134
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,300
Who is it?

1135
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
I'll say it with this.

1136
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
That's not funny.

1137
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,300
I didn't take it.

1138
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Who is it?

1139
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Who is it?

1140
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,300
I'm looking forward to it.

1141
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,300
I'm looking forward to it.

1142
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,300
I'm looking forward to it.

1143
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,300
Wait a minute.

1144
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
What are you doing?

1145
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,300
No.1 and No.2 look good together.

1146
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,300
Because they are two.

1147
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,300
He's a good king.

1148
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,300
I'm so excited, Haru.

1149
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
The king will also get bitten.

1150
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
The king will also get bitten.

1151
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,300
The king will also get bitten.

1152
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
By himself?

1153
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
He's a good king.

1154
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Who's number one?

1155
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,300
I'm number two.

1156
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,300
I knew it.

1157
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,300
The king is fast.

1158
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,300
Well, well, well.

1159
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Junkyun, didn't you bring a camera today?

1160
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,300
I did.

1161
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,300
Double camera?

1162
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
Let's take a lot of pictures.

1163
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
Camera.

1164
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
You have a brother?

1165
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,300
I have to rub it.

1166
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
Rubbing.

1167
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,300
I want to rub it.

1168
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
Do you want to be rubbed?

1169
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
If you want to be rubbed, say it.

1170
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,300
I'll rub the double camera.

1171
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,300
I was the king.

1172
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
I was the king.

1173
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
I'll do it.

1174
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Why did you do it?

1175
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,300
I'll do it.

1176
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,300
Please rub it.

1177
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Is it Japanese?

1178
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,300
Even though it's On-sama.

1179
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,300
What is On-sama's order?

1180
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Absolutely.

1181
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
It seems to be happy.

1182
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,300
It's fun.

1183
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,300
It's big.

1184
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,300
It's big.

1185
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,300
It's big.

1186
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,300
The top is coming out.

1187
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,300
Hello.

1188
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Hello.

1189
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,300
The king is angry.

1190
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,300
The king feels good.

1191
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,300
The king's top is angry.

1192
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,300
What are you doing?

1193
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,300
Let's do it again.

1194
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,300
I can see the pants, but is it okay?

1195
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,300
Look, I can see the pants over here.

1196
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
What are you doing over there?

1197
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,300
It's a princess.

1198
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,300
It looks like a princess' boobs.

1199
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,300
It looks like a princess' boobs.

1200
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300
What does the king say?

1201
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,300
Absolutely!

1202
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,300
This is the king's order.

1203
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,300
Is it a princess' boobs?

1204
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
No, so it's a prince.

1205
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
Is it a princess' boobs?

1206
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1207
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1208
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,300
It's so pretty.

1209
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,300
It's so pretty.

1210
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,300
It's so pretty.

1211
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,300
It's so pretty.

1212
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,300
It's so pretty.

1213
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,300
It's so pretty.

1214
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,300
It's a beautiful color.

1215
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
It's amazing.

1216
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Her skin is white.

1217
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
Her skin is white.

1218
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,300
It's amazing.

1219
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,300
Show us.

1220
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,300
It's the Miso.

1221
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
Maybe if the king orders.

1222
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,300
I want to see Misa's boobs.

1223
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,300
I want to see Misa's boobs.

1224
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,300
Misa, come here.

1225
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,300
I hate videos.

1226
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,300
Don't show it.

1227
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,300
Show it to me.

1228
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,300
Show it to me.

1229
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,300
I won't show it.

1230
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Misa, show me your boobs.

1231
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
Show it to me.

1232
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,300
Show it to me.

1233
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,300
Show it to me.

1234
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,300
Show it to me.

1235
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,300
Everyone is enjoying the food.

1236
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,300
Everyone is getting more and more free.

1237
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,300
Is it free?

1238
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Is the rice cake free?

1239
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,300
It seems that the rice cake is free.

1240
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,300
The rice cake is free.

1241
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,300
Misami-san, you can eat too.

1242
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,300
Everyone is showing, so I'm not afraid.

1243
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,300
Everyone is showing, so I'm not afraid.

1244
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,300
Everyone is showing, so I'm not afraid.

1245
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,300
This is bad.

1246
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,300
This is bad!

1247
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,300
This is bad!

1248
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,300
There is a fire.

1249
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,300
It's burning.

1250
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,300
It's burning.

1251
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,300
Let's try again.

1252
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,300
What is it?

1253
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,300
It's a fire.

1254
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,300
There is a fire.

1255
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,300
It's a fire.

1256
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,300
There is a fire.

1257
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
What?

1258
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
There is a fire.

1259
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
This is amazing.

1260
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,300
This is a bad situation.

1261
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,300
This is so embarrassing.

1262
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,300
This is a bad situation.

1263
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,300
Oh!

1264
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,300
It's big!

1265
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,300
This is bad!

1266
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,300
This is big!

1267
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,300
Oh my!

1268
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,300
It's green!

1269
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,300
The top of your head is standing up.

1270
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,300
I'm not standing up.

1271
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,300
The top of your head is standing up.

1272
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,300
Misami, you're thinking of something erotic, aren't you?

1273
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,300
I'm not thinking of anything.

1274
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,300
I don't want to talk to Pippi.

1275
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,300
Pippi?

1276
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,300
What is this?

1277
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,300
You're playing a game, aren't you?

1278
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Why?

1279
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,300
You're being buried, aren't you?

1280
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
She's my girlfriend.

1281
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,300
Is he drinking?

1282
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,300
He is drinking, too.

1283
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,300
He is drinking, too.

1284
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Stop it.

1285
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,300
Stop it.

1286
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,300
Are you okay?

1287
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
I'm okay.

1288
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,300
This is my memory.

1289
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,300
You can see it.

1290
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,300
I can't say something like that.

1291
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,300
I'm the only one who can't see it.

1292
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,300
Kachikochi station.

1293
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,300
Kachikochi station.

1294
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Kachikochi station.

1295
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,300
It's raining.

1296
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,300
It's raining.

1297
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,300
It's raining.

1298
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Kachikochi station.

1299
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
Kachikochi station.

1300
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,300
Kachikochi station.

1301
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,300
They are being touched.

1302
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,300
They are being touched.

1303
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,300
They look happy.

1304
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Oh, wait a minute.

1305
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
The game has nothing to do with it.

1306
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,300
Hey!

1307
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,300
Hey!

1308
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,300
Hey!

1309
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,300
No one is watching.

1310
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,300
No one is watching.

1311
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,300
Oh, no.

1312
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Damn it.

1313
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,300
I'm so angry.

1314
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,300
I want to see Sora-chan's boobs, too.

1315
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Why did you take it off?

1316
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,300
Sora-chan's boobs.

1317
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,300
Let's see Sora-chan's boobs, too.

1318
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,300
Everyone's showing it.

1319
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,300
What should I do?

1320
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,300
It's a ride.

1321
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,300
It's a momentum.

1322
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,300
You don't have to take it off with a bra.

1323
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,300
Bra?

1324
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,300
You can take it off.

1325
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,300
I don't know what to do.

1326
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,300
It's embarrassing.

1327
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,300
I don't want to show this to anyone.

1328
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,300
Let's take a look.

1329
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
It's white.

1330
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,300
It's white.

1331
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
It's a cute thing.

1332
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,300
Is it pink?

1333
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,300
Everyone.

1334
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,300
Sora-chan, Sora-chan is coming out.

1335
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,300
It's okay.

1336
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,300
Sora-chan, your cheeks are no good?

1337
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,300
My cheeks are no good.

1338
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,300
Sora-chan, your cheeks are no good?

1339
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,300
The last pine cone.

1340
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,300
The last pine cone.

1341
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
It's pretty big.

1342
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,300
I don't like it.

1343
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Even though it has a face.

1344
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,300
I didn't think it was that big.

1345
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,300
What are you shy about?

1346
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,300
It's big, it's big.

1347
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,300
If you see that, you'll get angry.

1348
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
Sorry, sorry.

1349
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Is it over?

1350
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,300
It's over.

1351
00:52:51,300 --> 00:53:01,300
Let's continue with the king's game.

1352
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:11,300
Let's continue with the king's game.

1353
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,300
Sora-chan, Sora-chan, Sora-chan, please show me your bra.

1354
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,300
Please show me your bra with the order of the king.

1355
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
The second one?

1356
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
The second one?

1357
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,300
I want to see the second one.

1358
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,300
What is it?

1359
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,300
Bring back the earth.

1360
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,300
Bring back the earth.

1361
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,300
Bring back the earth.

1362
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,300
Bring back the earth.

1363
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,300
Bring back the earth.

1364
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,300
Bring back the earth.

1365
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,300
You can't make it back.

1366
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,300
You can't make it back.

1367
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
You can't make it back.

1368
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,300
It's awful.

1369
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,300
It's terrible.

1370
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,300
I can't do this.

1371
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
It's the easiest way to do it.

1372
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,300
Is your phone okay?

1373
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Okay.

1374
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,300
Okay.

1375
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Here it comes.

1376
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,300
The king.

1377
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,300
Who is the king?

1378
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,300
Misa.

1379
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,300
Who is it?

1380
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,300
It's Misawa!

1381
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,300
Oh, Misawa is here!

1382
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,300
Congratulations!

1383
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,300
I did it!

1384
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,300
What's going on?

1385
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,300
What's going on?

1386
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:23,300
I'm looking for someone who can sleep with Misawa tonight.

1387
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,300
What's going on? Are you lonely?

1388
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,300
What do you think?

1389
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,300
Hey, hey, hey!

1390
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,300
I'm here!

1391
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,300
Hey, hey, hey!

1392
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,300
Where is Asumi-chan?

1393
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,300
Misawa...

1394
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,300
What's going on?

1395
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,300
What's going on?

1396
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,300
What do you do?

1397
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
No, no, no!

1398
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,300
I'm going to sleep with Hana-Hana.

1399
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
Hana-Hana.

1400
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,300
Hana-Hana.

1401
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,300
I'm going to sleep with Hana-Hana.

1402
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Hana-Hana.

1403
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,300
Hana-Hana.

1404
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,300
Hana-Hana.

1405
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,300
Okay, who wants to sleep with me?

1406
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
I don't want to.

1407
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,300
I don't want to sleep alone.

1408
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,300
I'm lonely.

1409
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,300
Who do you choose?

1410
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,300
He is sleeping.

1411
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,300
He's sleeping.

1412
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,300
He's sleeping.

1413
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,300
Go to the other side.

1414
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,300
I'm sorry.

1415
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,300
He didn't notice.

1416
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,300
He didn't notice.

1417
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,300
Oh no.

1418
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,300
He's pushing.

1419
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,300
He's getting stiff.

1420
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,300
What?

1421
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,300
He's getting stiff.

1422
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,300
Oh no.

1423
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,300
How about Yasu?

1424
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,300
Yasu is very good.

1425
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,300
He doesn't listen to Osama at all.

1426
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,300
What are you doing?

1427
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,300
He doesn't listen to Osama at all.

1428
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,300
Osama doesn't listen to Osama.

1429
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:12,300
Osama, everyone except Misa kisses.

1430
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,300
What?

1431
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,300
Everyone except Misa kisses.

1432
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,300
I don't need Misa.

1433
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,300
You don't need a man, do you?

1434
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,300
Yes.

1435
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,300
You kiss everyone you like.

1436
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,300
I kiss the person I like.

1437
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,300
Yes, kiss the person you like.

1438
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,300
Me?

1439
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,300
Yes, yes, yes.

1440
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,300
Other than the king?

1441
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,300
Other than the king.

1442
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:45,300
Everyone is in love.

1443
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,300
Haru is coming!

1444
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,300
Haru is coming!

1445
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,300
What happened?

1446
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,300
What happened?

1447
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Everyone is coming.

1448
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,300
No!

1449
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
I'm falling.

1450
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
Me too.

1451
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,300
Why are you touching Oppa?

1452
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,300
I want to touch too.

1453
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,300
Why?

1454
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,300
Oh yeah, peace.

1455
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,300
Hello.

1456
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,300
I didn't drink alcohol just now.

1457
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,300
Hello.

1458
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,300
Here, here.

1459
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,300
Hello.

1460
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,300
Hello.

1461
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,300
Oh no.

1462
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Hello.

1463
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,300
You don't refuse anything, do you?

1464
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,300
It's Balmie.

1465
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,300
It's hard, it's hard.

1466
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,300
It's hard, it's hard.

1467
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,300
That room.

1468
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,300
It's hard.

1469
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,300
It's hard.

1470
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,300
Hey.

1471
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,300
It's so cute.

1472
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,300
It's cute.

1473
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,300
It's amazing.

1474
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,300
Why?

1475
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1476
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,300
I don't know where to go.

1477
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,300
Everyone's underwear.

1478
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,300
Everyone's underwear.

1479
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,300
I'm embarrassed.

1480
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,300
No, no, no, no.

1481
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,300
I'm doing it here too.

1482
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1483
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1484
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,300
I'm hungry.

1485
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,300
Thank you.

1486
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,300
What's happening?

1487
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,300
Thank you.

1488
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,300
What's happening?

1489
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1490
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,300
Will you come?

1491
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Will you come?

1492
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,300
Is Chuck coming?

1493
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,300
Is Chuck coming?

1494
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,300
It's standing.

1495
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,300
It's standing.

1496
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,300
Oh, it's here.

1497
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,300
Oh, no.

1498
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,300
It's stuck.

1499
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,300
Is it a tea bag?

1500
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,300
What is this?

1501
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,300
It's a skeleton.

1502
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,300
It's eating a lot.

1503
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,300
Why is it not being peeled off?

1504
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,300
It's a piece of a cup.

1505
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,300
It's not a piece of a cup.

1506
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,300
Piece, piece, piece.

1507
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,300
Like this.

1508
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,300
I've been thinking about it for 3 years now.

1509
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,300
Let's take a picture of the boobs.

1510
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,300
Let's take a picture of the boobs.

1511
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,300
I'll take a picture of you.

1512
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,300
Let's take a picture of you.

1513
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,300
3 shots.

1514
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Is it okay to take a picture of the camera?

1515
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,300
It's okay.

1516
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,300
Let's take a picture of the camera.

1517
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,300
I want to see it.

1518
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,300
Let's take a picture of Hime.

1519
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,300
I'm taking a picture.

1520
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,300
Let's take a picture.

1521
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,300
What are you going to decide?

1522
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,300
Your hair is thin, isn't it?

1523
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,300
Your hair is thin, isn't it?

1524
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,300
Your whole body is thin, isn't it?

1525
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,300
Good, good.

1526
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,300
Drink, drink, drink.

1527
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,300
What are you doing? You're alone.

1528
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,300
What are you doing?

1529
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,300
What are you doing?

1530
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,300
Aren't you wet?

1531
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
I'm not wet.

1532
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
You're naughty.

1533
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,300
You're naughty.

1534
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
Hey!

1535
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,300
Hey!

1536
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,300
What's wrong?

1537
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,300
Mako, can you take it off?

1538
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,300
Yes, yes, yes.

1539
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1540
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,300
It's a little...

1541
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
You're pretty drunk, aren't you?

1542
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1543
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,300
Come here, come here.

1544
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1545
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1546
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,300
I want to take a break.

1547
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,300
I want to sleep.

1548
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1549
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,300
Are you okay?

1550
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,300
Let's go upstairs.

1551
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,300
Which room is upstairs?

1552
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,300
There is a place to rest upstairs.

1553
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Here?

1554
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,300
Wait a minute.

1555
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,300
Pull it.

1556
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,300
What's wrong with Kimori-chan?

1557
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,300
I can't stop here.

1558
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,300
Why can't I stop?

1559
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,300
What's wrong?

1560
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,300
I can't stop here.

1561
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,300
It's a little cool here.

1562
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,300
It's cool.

1563
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,300
I'm sorry.

1564
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,300
I'm sorry.

1565
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Are you okay?

1566
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,300
Are you okay?

1567
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,300
Help me!

1568
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,300
Wait a minute.

1569
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,300
What is it?

1570
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,300
Why?

1571
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,300
What is it?

1572
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,300
Why?

1573
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
I can't do it.

1574
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,300
Can I touch it?

1575
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,300
No.

1576
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,300
Lick it.

1577
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
I can't lick it.

1578
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,300
I can't lick it.

1579
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,300
It's okay.

1580
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
It's okay.

1581
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,300
What is it?

1582
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,300
I can't lick it.

1583
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,300
I really can't drink.

1584
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,300
Let's drink.

1585
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,300
Let's drink.

1586
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,300
Drink it up.

1587
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,300
Drink it up.

1588
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
Drink it up.

1589
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
Hey!

1590
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:28,300
I really don't know what to do.

1591
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,300
Huh?

1592
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,300
Huh?

1593
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,300
Huh?

1594
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,300
Huh?

1595
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Huh?

1596
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,300
Huh?

1597
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,300
Huh?

1598
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,300
Huh?

1599
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,300
Huh?

1600
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,300
Huh?

1601
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,300
No, it's not.

1602
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,300
It's delicious.

1603
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,300
It's delicious.

1604
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,300
I can't do it anymore.

1605
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,300
I can't do it anymore.

1606
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,300
Do you want to eat it?

1607
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,300
Can you open your mouth?

1608
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,300
I can't hear your lower part of your mouth

1609
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:29,300
I can't open my mouth

1610
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,300
I can't open my mouth

1611
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,300
Really?

1612
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Can't you open your mouth?

1613
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,300
I'm going to put it in the bottom

1614
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,300
Do you want to see it?

1615
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,300
Can you come here?

1616
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,300
Come here

1617
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,300
What kind of place is there in the bottom?

1618
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,300
Come here

1619
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,300
I can't see the bottom

1620
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,300
Can you see it?

1621
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,300
I can't see the bottom

1622
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,300
I'm scared

1623
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,300
What?

1624
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,300
Why?

1625
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,300
I don't know.

1626
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,300
It will be hot.

1627
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,300
I don't want to do it anymore.

1628
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,300
I don't want to do it anymore.

1629
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,300
Why do you look like you don't know anything?

1630
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,300
Why do you think that?

1631
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,300
Why do you think that?

1632
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,300
Yes, yes, yes.

1633
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,300
What is this?

1634
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:08,020
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

1635
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,960
I'm so tired.

1636
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I'm tired.

1637
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,280
Do your best.

1638
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,280
Do your best.

1639
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,280
Do your best.

1640
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,280
Do your best.

1641
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,280
Do your best.

1642
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Do your best.

1643
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,280
Do your best.

1644
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,280
Do your best.

1645
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,280
I'm sorry.

1646
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,280
I'm sorry.

1647
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,280
I'm sorry.

1648
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,280
I'm sorry.

1649
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,280
Are you ok?

1650
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,280
A little more.

1651
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,280
You're feeling good, right?

1652
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,280
I'm feeling good.

1653
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,280
Come on.

1654
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,280
The sound from up there.

1655
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,280
Is it okay?

1656
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,280
Is it okay?

1657
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,280
Is it okay?

1658
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,280
Is it okay?

1659
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,280
Is it okay?

1660
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,280
Is it okay?

1661
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,280
Ok, let's start.

1662
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,280
No, that's not the right hand.

1663
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,280
I see.

1664
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,280
Let's play games together.

1665
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,280
Yeah, let's play games together.

1666
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,280
Let's play games together.

1667
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,280
I wanna see the stars.

1668
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,280
The other side is cut off.

1669
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,280
It's cut off.

1670
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,280
It's cut off.

1671
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,280
Oh, it's cut off.

1672
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,280
It's cut off.

1673
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
What is it?

1674
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,280
I'll do it.

1675
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,280
Do you want to stop?

1676
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,280
I'm sorry.

1677
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,280
Stop it.

1678
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,280
I'm sorry.

1679
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,280
I'm sorry.

1680
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,280
I'm sorry.

1681
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,280
I'm sorry.

1682
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,280
I'm sorry.

1683
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,280
I'm sorry.

1684
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,280
I'm sorry.

1685
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,280
I'm so tired.

1686
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,280
I'm so tired.

1687
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,280
I'm so tired.

1688
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,280
There was a cushion.

1689
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,280
I'll bring it.

1690
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,280
What is it?

1691
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,280
I'll bring a cushion.

1692
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,280
I'm tired.

1693
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,280
I'm so tired.

1694
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,280
I'm tired.

1695
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,280
I'm tired.

1696
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,280
I have a cushion.

1697
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,280
I have a cushion.

1698
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,280
I have a cushion.

1699
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,280
I want to go to the bathroom.

1700
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,280
I want to go to the bathroom.

1701
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,280
I want to go to the bathroom.

1702
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,280
Do you like this?

1703
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,280
Yes.

1704
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,280
Are you OK?

1705
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,280
What are you doing?

1706
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,280
Are you seriously not going to sleep?

1707
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,280
I want to see it.

1708
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,280
I want to see it.

1709
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,280
I'm not going to sleep.

1710
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,280
I'm so happy.

1711
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,280
Is it okay to say this?

1712
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,280
Okay.

1713
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,280
What is it?

1714
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
What is it?

1715
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,280
It's an H.

1716
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,280
There's only pink here.

1717
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,280
He drew my butt.

1718
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,280
That's good.

1719
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,280
I feel like he's going to do it.

1720
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,280
Don't you want to do it with that?

1721
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,280
You like idols, don't you?

1722
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,280
Just a little bit.

1723
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,280
You're quite an idol.

1724
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,280
Do you feel hot?

1725
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,280
I'm glad you feel hot.

1726
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,280
This bath is beautiful.

1727
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,280
I want to take a bath in the sun.

1728
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,280
I want to take a bath in the sun.

1729
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,280
Hime-chan is very sad...

1730
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,280
I'm sorry.

1731
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,280
I'm sorry.

1732
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,280
I'm sorry.

1733
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,280
You're not crying.

1734
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,280
I'm sorry.

1735
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:31,280
I don't think we should do this.

1736
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,280
You should be angry.

1737
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,280
Wait a minute.

1738
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,280
Should we say it?

1739
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,280
I don't know what it is.

1740
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,280
What is this?

1741
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,280
It's a circle gown.

1742
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,280
Wow, everyone's pants are the same.

1743
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,280
Mine too?

1744
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,280
Wait a minute.

1745
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,280
Denis is always wearing a black shirt.

1746
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,280
You're taking off something like that.

1747
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,280
That's right.

1748
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,280
It's a pant.

1749
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,280
Wow!

1750
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,280
It's a pant.

1751
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,280
It's good.

1752
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,280
I'm sorry.

1753
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,280
He is so cute.

1754
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,280
He is so cute.

1755
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,280
He is so sweet.

1756
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,280
He is so sweet.

1757
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,280
He is drinking too much.

1758
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,280
He is so sweet.

1759
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,280
He is so cute.

1760
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,280
What?

1761
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,280
He is holding the camera.

1762
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,280
You want me to touch it?

1763
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,280
Yes, you want me to touch it.

1764
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,280
Then why did you leave me alone?

1765
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,280
You're a camera.

1766
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,280
It's far away.

1767
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,280
It's far away.

1768
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,280
If you want to kiss, come here.

1769
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,280
Oh,

1770
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,280
Oh,

1771
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,280
Oh,

1772
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Oh,

1773
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,280
Oh,

1774
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,280
Oh,

1775
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,280
Oh!

1776
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,980
Sorry, I'm being too hard on you.

1777
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,980
No, no.

1778
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:40,980
Don't hurt your hand.

1779
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:41,980
It tastes like chocolate.

1780
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:42,480
It does.

1781
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,980
I want to eat a raccoon.

1782
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,980
It tastes like chocolate.

1783
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,780
It does.

1784
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,780
It tastes like chocolate.

1785
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,780
Oh!

1786
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:55,780
It's a bento.

1787
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,780
That's the best.

1788
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:01,780
He's the best, isn't he?

1789
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,780
I'm glad he's alive today.

1790
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,780
He's the best.

1791
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,780
He's the best when he's so light.

1792
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,780
Look over there.

1793
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,780
What are you doing?

1794
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,780
Good, isn't it?

1795
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,780
I want to drink something deep.

1796
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,780
Something good.

1797
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,780
I drank too much.

1798
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,780
I'm alive.

1799
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,780
It's good.

1800
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,780
It's good.

1801
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,780
It's amazing.

1802
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,780
Thank you.

1803
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:42,780
It's so light.

1804
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,780
The environment is so nice.

1805
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,780
Why are you licking your nails?

1806
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:02,780
I'm licking your nails.

1807
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,780
What?

1808
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:04,780
I'm licking your nails.

1809
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,780
I'll make it for you.

1810
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,780
I'll make it for you.

1811
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,780
Earth.

1812
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,780
This is the best.

1813
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,780
This is the best.

1814
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,780
This is the best.

1815
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:22,780
Earth.

1816
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,780
Earth, not Earth.

1817
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,780
Not Earth.

1818
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,780
I'm grateful to the Earth.

1819
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,780
It's so beautiful.

1820
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,780
It's beautiful.

1821
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,780
It's good, right?

1822
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,780
Yes.

1823
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,780
That's good.

1824
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,780
I can feel it.

1825
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:50,780
I'm scared.

1826
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,780
I'm scared.

1827
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,780
I'm sorry.

1828
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,780
Does it feel good?

1829
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,780
Yes.

1830
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,780
I'm sorry.

1831
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,780
I'm sorry.

1832
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,780
Hime is sorry.

1833
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,780
Look at this.

1834
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,780
I'm sorry.

1835
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,780
Wait a minute.

1836
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,780
What are you doing?

1837
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:21,780
I said I was sorry.

1838
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,780
Really?

1839
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,900
Can you do it for me?

1840
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,240
No, you can't.

1841
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
Poor thing.

1842
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,240
Poor thing.

1843
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,240
Poor thing?

1844
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,240
No, no.

1845
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,240
Like this.

1846
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,240
Give me your hand.

1847
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,240
Here.

1848
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,240
What's wrong?

1849
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,240
Do you like Tsukubi?

1850
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,240
Do you want a kiss?

1851
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,240
Do you like Tsukubi?

1852
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I do.

1853
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,240
It's coming.

1854
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,240
Give me your hand.

1855
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,240
Let's go.

1856
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,240
Something has started.

1857
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,240
Let's take a look.

1858
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,240
Let's take a look.

1859
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
We can see there.

1860
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,240
How is it?

1861
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,240
How is it?

1862
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
Can you see it?

1863
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,240
Can you see it?

1864
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,240
Is it starting?

1865
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,240
It's starting.

1866
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,240
It's starting.

1867
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,240
It's starting.

1868
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,240
It's not just us.

1869
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,240
It's the first time I've seen someone.

1870
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,240
I'm scared.

1871
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,240
Are you okay?

1872
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,240
I'm okay.

1873
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,240
Are you okay?

1874
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,240
I'm okay.

1875
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,240
Are you okay?

1876
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,240
I'm okay.

1877
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:36,240
Let's have a toast and have a drink.

1878
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,240
You drink a lot, don't you?

1879
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
You drink a lot, don't you?

1880
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,240
I drink a lot.

1881
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,240
Really?

1882
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,240
It's better to go home.

1883
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,240
That's good.

1884
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,240
It's good to drink a little.

1885
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,240
Do you usually drink alcohol?

1886
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,240
I can drink, but I'm weak.

1887
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,240
Really?

1888
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,240
Are you pretty drunk?

1889
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,240
A little.

1890
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,240
A little?

1891
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,240
There is something inside the bag.

1892
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,240
It's amazing, isn't it?

1893
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,240
I'm not.

1894
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,240
You are not?

1895
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,240
I'm not.

1896
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,240
I'm not.

1897
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,240
You are not?

1898
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,240
Why?

1899
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,240
I want to go to the gym.

1900
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,240
I see.

1901
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,240
I'm tired.

1902
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,240
I'm tired.

1903
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,240
I want to go back

1904
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,540
I thought you were playing with me.

1905
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:21,540
I didn't notice.

1906
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:25,540
I'm sorry.

1907
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:27,540
I'm sorry.

1908
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,540
I'm sorry.

1909
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,540
I'm sorry.

1910
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,540
I'm sorry.

1911
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:36,540
I'm sorry.

1912
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,540
I'm sorry.

1913
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,540
I'm sorry.

1914
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,540
I'm sorry.

1915
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:52,540
I wanted to do it a little bit more.

1916
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,540
I'm sorry.

1917
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,540
You're sorry?

1918
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:00,540
It's cold, isn't it?

1919
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,040
You are doing a very beautiful work.

1920
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,040
I've never done this before.

1921
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,040
You've never had it?

1922
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,040
Now that you're so chubby, you're such an idiot.

1923
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,040
I'm sorry.

1924
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,040
It feels good.

1925
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,040
It feels good.

1926
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,040
Let's lick it.

1927
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,040
Let's lick it.

1928
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,040
Delicious.

1929
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,040
You're not waiting for me, are you?

1930
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,040
Wait a minute.

1931
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,040
I'll call you later.

1932
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,040
What? Later?

1933
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,040
Are you okay?

1934
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,040
No, I'm not.

1935
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,040
You're not in a rush, are you okay?

1936
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,040
I'm just touching you.

1937
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,040
Are you okay?

1938
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,040
Yeah, it feels good.

1939
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,040
You're my boyfriend.

1940
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,040
I didn't expect you to have sex with me.

1941
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,040
I didn't expect it.

1942
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,040
Do you care if I do something wrong?

1943
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,040
It's my fault.

1944
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,040
It's my fault.

1945
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,040
I'm sorry.

1946
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,040
I'm sorry.

1947
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,040
There's a lot of it.

1948
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,040
There's a lot.

1949
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,040
I'm tired.

1950
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,040
Oh, great.

1951
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,040
What is it?

1952
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,040
I'm sorry.

1953
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:31,040
Ouch!

1954
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:33,540
Ouch!

1955
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,040
Ouch!

1956
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:46,540
I'm going to die.

1957
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,540
It's gone.

1958
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:56,540
This is the first time I've ever done this, so I'm a little nervous, but I'm going to do my best.

1959
01:46:56,540 --> 01:47:06,540
I'm going to do my best, so I'm going to do my best, so I'm going to do my best.

1960
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,540
I can't do it anymore.

1961
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,040
This is hard.

1962
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:24,040
It's a scene of a man who was so excited and started crying.

1963
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,040
I'm sorry...

1964
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,040
I can't help but laugh...

1965
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,040
I'm sorry...

1966
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,040
I'm sorry...

1967
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,040
I can't help but laugh...

1968
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,040
I'm sorry...

1969
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,040
I'm sorry...

1970
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,040
I'm sorry...

1971
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,040
I'm sorry...

1972
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,040
I'm sorry...

1973
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,040
I'm sorry...

1974
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,040
I'm sorry...

1975
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,040
Oh, it hurts.

1976
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,040
Oh, it hurts.

1977
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,040
It hurts...

1978
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,040
It hurts...

1979
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,040
Wait...

1980
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,040
It hurts...

1981
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,040
Wait...

1982
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,040
I'm sorry...

1983
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,040
I'm sorry...

1984
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,040
I'm sorry...

1985
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,040
Ah...

1986
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:29,040
Ah...

1987
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,040
Ah...

1988
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,040
Ah...

1989
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,040
Ah...

1990
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:37,040
Ah...

1991
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,040
Ah...

1992
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,040
I'm getting a little tired.

1993
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,040
It's okay.

1994
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,040
It's okay.

1995
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,040
It's okay.

1996
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,040
I'm sorry.

1997
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,040
I did a lot.

1998
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,040
I did a lot.

1999
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,040
She's definitely doing it, isn't she?

2000
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,040
She's doing it.

2001
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,040
She's doing it.

2002
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,040
Are you okay?

2003
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,040
Yes, I'm okay.

2004
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,040
You've been hurt.

2005
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,040
You've been hurt.

2006
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,040
Is your boyfriend's phone okay?

2007
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,040
Is your boyfriend's phone okay?

2008
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,040
It's okay.

2009
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,040
I want to go to the hospital.

2010
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,040
Look at me.

2011
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,040
What are you doing?

2012
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,040
I'm kissing you.

2013
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,040
It's important to kiss each other.

2014
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,040
It's tickling.

2015
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,040
Why?

2016
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,040
I'm sorry.

2017
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,040
I want to make you feel better.

2018
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,040
You're so cute.

2019
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,040
You're so cute.

2020
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,040
Yasu?

2021
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,040
You're so cute.

2022
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,040
You're so cute.

2023
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,040
Yasu is so cute.

2024
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,040
You're so cute.

2025
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,040
Yasu has a sexy voice.

2026
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,040
I like you.

2027
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:20,040
I'm sorry.

2028
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,040
I like you a lot.

2029
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,040
I was surprised at first.

2030
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:26,040
I don't remember.

2031
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:28,040
I don't remember.

2032
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,040
I don't remember.

2033
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,040
I don't remember.

2034
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,040
I suddenly kiss you.

2035
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,040
Kiss.

2036
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,040
Do you like it?

2037
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,040
Yes.

2038
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,040
Let's do it together.

2039
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,040
In the same position?

2040
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,040
In the same position.

2041
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,040
Both sides?

2042
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:52,040
Yes.

2043
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,040
I see.

2044
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,040
You can do it.

2045
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,040
You can do it.

2046
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,040
Your hands are high.

2047
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,040
You can do it.

2048
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:09,040
It's the other way around, isn't it?

2049
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,040
Why are you so hot?

2050
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,040
I don't know.

2051
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,040
Aren't you too popular because you drink too much?

2052
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:24,040
I'm so excited.

2053
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:41,040
I want to take a picture of myself.

2054
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,040
I want to take a picture of Tsukumi being licked.

2055
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,040
No, I don't want to.

2056
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,040
What do you think?

2057
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,040
Why don't you two do it?

2058
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,040
You two do it.

2059
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,040
What do you mean?

2060
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,040
Both sides.

2061
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,040
I'll take it.

2062
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,040
Give me the sake.

2063
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,040
Here you go.

2064
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,040
Drink it.

2065
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,040
Let's do it together.

2066
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,040
You don't mess around.

2067
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,040
Shut up.

2068
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,040
Do you want to drink it?

2069
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
Let's take a picture together.

2070
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,040
Look at the camera.

2071
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:25,040
How is it?

2072
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,040
Hime-chan is erotic.

2073
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,040
Hey, hey, why are you like this?

2074
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,040
You're so pitiful.

2075
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,040
Chichi, come out quickly.

2076
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:43,040
I want to take out my penis.

2077
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:46,040
Do you want to take out your penis?

2078
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:49,040
I want to take out my penis.

2079
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,040
I want to kiss you.

2080
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,040
I want to kiss you while kissing you.

2081
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:03,040
Do you want to kiss me directly?

2082
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,040
I want to kiss you.

2083
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,040
It's stuck.

2084
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,040
It's stuck.

2085
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,040
It hurts.

2086
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,040
Next.

2087
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,040
I like this.

2088
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,040
Do you like this?

2089
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,040
I can't do that.

2090
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,040
Do you want me to lick it?

2091
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,040
I want you to lick it.

2092
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,040
Please

2093
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,040
Look at this

2094
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,040
She looks cute

2095
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,040
Look at this

2096
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:59,040
Which do you like better?

2097
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,040
Which one do you think is better?

2098
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,040
What else?

2099
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,040
O-Ten-Pin?

2100
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,040
O-Ten-Po

2101
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,040
O-Chin-Po is Shiko-Shiko

2102
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,040
Shiko-Shiko

2103
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,040
It's a bit edgy

2104
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,040
What? For example?

2105
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,040
Chimpo...

2106
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,040
Chimpo-Kin-Kin

2107
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,040
You're drawing

2108
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,040
O-Chin-Po is very energetic

2109
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,040
What do you want this energetic O-Chin-Po to do?

2110
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,040
More

2111
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:41,040
I'm not sure if it's okay to do it with you two, but is it okay to do it with your boyfriend?

2112
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,040
I haven't said anything about it today.

2113
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:46,040
I don't care because it's dry.

2114
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:48,040
I don't think it will be exposed.

2115
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,040
I don't think it will be exposed.

2116
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,040
What will you do if it is exposed?

2117
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:55,040
I'll say, I'm sorry.

2118
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,040
I might forgive you if you're my boyfriend.

2119
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,040
Do you want to do it again?

2120
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,040
Let's do it together.

2121
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,040
Let's do it together.

2122
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,040
Let's do it together.

2123
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,040
Cute.

2124
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,040
I don't want to.

2125
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:08,040
You can do it.

2126
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:12,040
I'm drunk, so it doesn't matter.

2127
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:14,040
I can't drink alcohol.

2128
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,040
Alcohol is the best.

2129
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:18,040
I love alcohol.

2130
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:21,040
I like the two of you more than alcohol.

2131
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:24,040
I'm glad I drank it.

2132
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:27,040
I thought you were really cute when we met today.

2133
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,040
Are you having fun?

2134
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,040
What is this?

2135
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:35,040
What is this?

2136
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,040
Do you want to eat it?

2137
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,040
I'll give it to you.

2138
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,040
I'll give it to you.

2139
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:46,040
Do you like it?

2140
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,040
Do you like me?

2141
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:50,040
Do you like me?

2142
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:53,040
I'm scared.

2143
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:56,040
Can I touch it?

2144
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:59,040
Can I touch it?

2145
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:02,040
It's cute.

2146
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:11,040
I have something I want to do.

2147
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,040
Me? Monkey?

2148
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,040
What are you doing?

2149
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,040
I'm sorry.

2150
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,040
I also want to see.

2151
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,040
I'm sorry.

2152
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,040
I'm sorry.

2153
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:28,040
I want to see that.

2154
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:32,040
Look.

2155
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,040
Are you feeling good?

2156
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,040
Hey.

2157
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:38,040
It's heaven.

2158
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:40,040
It's amazing.

2159
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,040
This is a big hit.

2160
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:44,040
It's a big hit.

2161
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,040
I'm sorry.

2162
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:48,040
I'm about to cry.

2163
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,040
Yasu has a good face.

2164
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,040
I'm scared.

2165
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,040
Yasu, take it out.

2166
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,040
I still want to take it out.

2167
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,040
How do you feel?

2168
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,040
I'm happy.

2169
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,040
Yasu, you're cute.

2170
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:14,040
I want to kiss you.

2171
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,040
It's cheap, isn't it?

2172
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:20,040
It's a very romantic place.

2173
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,040
It's a heaven.

2174
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,040
I'm going to sleep now.

2175
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,040
What about Niyodo?

2176
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,040
It's cute.

2177
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,040
Hey, hey, hey.

2178
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,040
Niyodo is cute.

2179
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,040
Niyodo is cute?

2180
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,040
Niyodo is cute.

2181
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:38,040
Niyodo is cute.

2182
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,040
Stop it.

2183
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,040
Stop drinking.

2184
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:44,040
Hello

2185
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:46,040
Cute

2186
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,040
Hey

2187
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:50,040
Hey

2188
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,040
What?

2189
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:54,040
Canary?

2190
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,040
Watering

2191
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:58,040
Here

2192
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:00,040
I want to die

2193
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,040
I want to die

2194
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,040
I want to die

2195
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,040
What happened to your butt?

2196
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,040
My butt

2197
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,040
What's going on?

2198
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,040
It's a chikubimbi.

2199
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,040
It's dangerous.

2200
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,040
It's bad.

2201
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,040
It's dangerous.

2202
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:28,040
It's dangerous.

2203
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,040
Really?

2204
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:32,040
Is it dangerous?

2205
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:34,040
It's dangerous.

2206
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,040
No, no, no, no!

2207
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:38,040
F***!

2208
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,040
Please, stop it!

2209
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:44,040
F***!

2210
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:46,040
F***!

2211
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:53,040
Wait!

2212
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,040
That's too much!

2213
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:57,040
It hurts.

2214
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,040
It's painful.

2215
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,040
Wait a minute.

2216
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:04,040
Please give me a piece of water.

2217
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:06,040
A piece of water for girls.

2218
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,040
It's like a attraction.

2219
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,040
It's painful.

2220
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:15,040
It's melting.

2221
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:20,040
You look like a person who is in a game.

2222
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:22,040
I'm sorry.

2223
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:24,040
Didn't you put salt in it?

2224
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:26,040
You put salt in it, didn't you?

2225
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,040
My butt hurts.

2226
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:30,040
How was it? Was it good?

2227
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,040
It was good.

2228
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:34,040
What is this?

2229
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,040
I'll wipe it for you.

2230
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,040
What is this?

2231
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,040
I'll lick it for you.

2232
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,040
It looks like an SA.

2233
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,040
It looks like it's bleeding.

2234
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:46,040
It's dangerous.

2235
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:50,040
You're kind.

2236
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,040
I can't stand it.

2237
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,040
I can't stand it.

2238
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:56,040
I can't stand it.

2239
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,040
Chocolate?

2240
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,040
Is it delicious?

2241
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:04,040
Is it delicious?

2242
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:06,040
Is it delicious?

2243
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:08,040
Is it sweet?

2244
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,040
It's delicious.

2245
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:12,040
It's delicious.

2246
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:14,040
She licked the chicken.

2247
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,040
She licked the chicken.

2248
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,040
Yasu has a great attitude.

2249
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:20,040
He looks like a pervert.

2250
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:28,040
He looks like a boy who is being bullied.

2251
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,040
Open your mouth.

2252
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:35,040
Was it funny?

2253
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,040
It was really funny.

2254
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,040
sex is the best

2255
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:11,040
I'm surprised

2256
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,040
you are the best

2257
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,040
you are the best

2258
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,040
do you feel good?

2259
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,040
cute?

2260
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,040
do you want to do it?

2261
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,040
do you want to do it?

2262
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,040
do you want to do it?

2263
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,040
do you want to do it?

2264
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,040
do you want to do it?

2265
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:35,040
sorry

2266
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,820
Do you want to sit down?

2267
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:38,820
She is standing.

2268
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,800
Oh my god, she is moving a lot.

2269
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,800
Please calm down.

2270
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,800
Naro-chan, are you in a panic?

2271
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,800
Oh my god.

2272
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,800
Naro-chan, listen to me.

2273
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,800
Is it fun?

2274
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,800
Is it fun?

2275
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,800
Yes, it is.

2276
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,800
It is fun to play with her.

2277
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,800
Really?

2278
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,800
Naro-chan, can you stand up?

2279
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:07,800
Which one do you like better, your underwear or...

2280
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:11,800
I want to see it directly.

2281
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:13,800
You want to see it directly?

2282
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:15,800
Yes, I want to see it directly.

2283
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,800
That's crazy.

2284
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,800
I'll give it to you.

2285
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:20,800
Your underwear.

2286
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:21,800
Is it okay?

2287
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:22,800
It's a present.

2288
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:23,800
You're happy, aren't you?

2289
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:24,800
I'll give it to you.

2290
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,800
It smells good.

2291
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:26,800
It's coming.

2292
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:27,800
It's amazing.

2293
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:28,800
Do you want to lick it more?

2294
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,800
Yes, I want to lick it more.

2295
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,800
I want to lick it.

2296
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,800
I want to lick it.

2297
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,800
I want to get used to it.

2298
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,800
I want to lick it.

2299
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,800
More.

2300
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,800
More.

2301
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,800
Don't worry.

2302
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,800
I'm scared.

2303
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,800
I'm scared.

2304
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,800
I'm scared.

2305
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,800
I'm scared.

2306
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:55,800
Nobody is saying that with a face like this.

2307
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,800
I understand.

2308
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,800
I'm sorry.

2309
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,800
I want to take a bath.

2310
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:03,800
I'm so sleepy.

2311
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,800
So sleepy.

2312
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,800
So sleepy.

2313
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,800
So sleepy.

2314
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:11,800
So sleepy.

2315
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,800
I'm so sleepy.

2316
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:17,800
I'm started to hold the camera.

2317
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:19,800
I'm so sleepy.

2318
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,800
I'm so excited.

2319
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,800
I want to hold it.

2320
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,800
I want to hold it.

2321
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:27,800
I want to take a video of you licking it.

2322
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:35,800
I feel like I'm getting used to the power of alcohol.

2323
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:39,800
I feel good.

2324
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,800
It's weird, isn't it?

2325
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,800
I think it's good to put it on your butt.

2326
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:25,800
I'm sorry

2327
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:37,800
What do you want to do with this?

2328
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,800
What do you want to do with this?

2329
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:40,800
This

2330
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:44,800
That's what happens when you come this far

2331
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,800
Say it properly

2332
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:47,800
Say it properly

2333
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:48,800
I'll put it in

2334
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:49,800
Where?

2335
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:50,800
I'll put it in the basket

2336
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:51,800
What?

2337
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:52,800
Jinpo

2338
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,800
What are you doing?

2339
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,800
Throw it properly!

2340
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,800
I want to put the ball in the bag.

2341
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,800
You want to put it in the bag?

2342
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,800
You want to put it in the bag?

2343
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,800
You want to put it in?

2344
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:07,800
You want to put it in?

2345
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:09,800
You haven't put it in yet?

2346
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:11,800
You haven't put it in yet?

2347
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:12,800
It feels good, Chien-chan.

2348
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,800
It feels really good.

2349
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,800
I'm going to sing a song.

2350
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,800
Why don't you put it in?

2351
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:19,800
Why do you do that?

2352
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,800
I'm a pervert.

2353
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,800
I'm a pervert.

2354
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:33,800
Did you make your boyfriend go out a lot today?

2355
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:37,800
I don't want you to go out like this every day.

2356
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,800
I don't do it with my boyfriend.

2357
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:41,800
Look at this.

2358
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:43,800
What are you going to do?

2359
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,800
I'm already wearing it.

2360
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:46,800
What should I do?

2361
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:47,800
What should you do?

2362
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,800
Please put it in.

2363
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,800
More?

2364
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:50,800
What do you want to do?

2365
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,800
Just a little bit.

2366
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:52,800
Just a little bit?

2367
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,800
Yes.

2368
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:54,800
Please.

2369
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:55,800
Is it okay?

2370
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:56,800
It's because you're wearing a tie.

2371
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,800
Is it that much?

2372
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:00,800
Wow.

2373
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,800
You're putting it in so quickly.

2374
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,800
You're putting it in.

2375
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:07,800
My hips...

2376
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:08,800
What?

2377
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:09,800
I'm going to go straight.

2378
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:10,800
Where are you going?

2379
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,800
My knees are cramping.

2380
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,800
Do you want me to put it in too?

2381
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,800
Congratulations!

2382
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,800
Wait, wait! I want to put it in too!

2383
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,800
What is this?

2384
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,800
Are you going to put it in?

2385
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,800
It's too close.

2386
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,800
Don't grab it.

2387
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,800
It's in.

2388
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,800
It's in.

2389
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,800
Yasu, it's in.

2390
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,800
It's in.

2391
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,800
This feels good.

2392
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,800
HimeRin.

2393
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,800
This is bad.

2394
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,800
This is bad.

2395
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,800
This is bad.

2396
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,800
I think I can take it all.

2397
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,800
It feels good.

2398
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:20,800
You look happy.

2399
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,800
It feels good.

2400
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,800
It feels good.

2401
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,800
Say more.

2402
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,800
Whose mark is it?

2403
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,800
It feels good.

2404
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,800
You're going to die.

2405
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,800
You're going to die.

2406
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,800
You're going to die.

2407
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,800
Give me your bag.

2408
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,800
Give me your bag.

2409
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:55,800
Hey!

2410
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,800
Who said that?

2411
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:59,800
I'm sorry.

2412
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:00,800
It's okay.

2413
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,800
It's okay.

2414
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,800
It's okay.

2415
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,800
You can't do that.

2416
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,800
Lend me the camera.

2417
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,800
Lend me the camera.

2418
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,800
Amazing.

2419
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,800
I'm scared.

2420
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,800
Put a lot of weight on your back.

2421
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,800
I will.

2422
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,800
I'll move you a lot.

2423
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,800
Stand up from the back.

2424
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,800
Do you want to sit down?

2425
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,800
Oh my god!

2426
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,800
Harumi-san, you're amazing!

2427
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:46,800
You have to show it.

2428
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,800
Oh, wait a minute.

2429
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:50,800
If I were you...

2430
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,800
Take a picture.

2431
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,800
Look at the camera.

2432
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,800
Look at the camera.

2433
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,800
Peep, peep.

2434
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,800
Come here.

2435
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,800
I'm sorry.

2436
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,800
I'm sorry.

2437
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,800
More.

2438
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,800
More!

2439
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,800
Go!

2440
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,800
Go!

2441
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,800
I'm scared!

2442
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,800
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

2443
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,800
I'm so happy.

2444
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,800
I'm so happy.

2445
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,800
Why are you so happy?

2446
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,800
Sex is the best.

2447
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,800
Sex is the best.

2448
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:53,800
How do you feel?

2449
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,800
I'm so happy.

2450
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,800
Is it good?

2451
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:59,800
Did you come here?

2452
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,800
Yes

2453
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,800
Do you want more?

2454
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:05,800
Yes

2455
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:07,800
Look over there

2456
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,800
What about there?

2457
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:11,800
What about there?

2458
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,800
What about there?

2459
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,800
No

2460
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:17,800
This one is OK

2461
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:19,800
OK

2462
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,800
This one is OK

2463
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,800
Do you put this one in?

2464
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,800
Yes

2465
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,800
Let's put it in.

2466
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,800
Who wants to put it in?

2467
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:51,800
Hold it.

2468
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:53,800
I'll hold it.

2469
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,800
Look at the camera.

2470
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,800
It feels good.

2471
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,800
It's really in.

2472
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,800
Does it feel good?

2473
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,800
It's dangerous.

2474
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:05,800
What's dangerous?

2475
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:13,800
Sex is the best.

2476
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,800
Sex is the best.

2477
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:19,800
Kissing is the best

2478
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:33,800
Why are you pulling it out?

2479
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,800
Don't pull it out

2480
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:41,800
It's coming out

2481
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:13,800
You are good at jumping.

2482
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,800
How is your jump?

2483
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:17,800
I can't jump.

2484
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:19,800
I can't jump.

2485
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,800
I can't jump.

2486
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:25,800
You are very excited.

2487
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,800
You are very excited.

2488
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,800
You are very excited.

2489
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,800
I can do it.

2490
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,800
I can do it.

2491
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:35,800
I can do it.

2492
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,800
You can do it.

2493
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:39,800
You can do it.

2494
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:11,800
Yasu, hold this.

2495
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:16,800
What is it?

2496
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:17,800
It's dangerous.

2497
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:18,800
Is it dangerous?

2498
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,800
It's dangerous.

2499
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:21,800
I'm going to die.

2500
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:23,800
No, no, I'm going to come out.

2501
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,800
Who do you think you are?

2502
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,800
Stop, stop, I'm going to come out.

2503
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:31,800
No?

2504
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:33,800
No? Then should I do it here?

2505
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2506
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:37,800
No, no, no!

2507
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:39,800
What?

2508
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:41,800
You're gonna live?

2509
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:43,800
No, I don't want to.

2510
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:45,800
You're gonna live?

2511
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,800
No, no, no!

2512
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,800
You're gonna live?

2513
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:51,800
I'm gonna die.

2514
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:53,800
You're gonna live, right?

2515
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:55,800
I'm gonna kill you.

2516
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:57,800
You're gonna live?

2517
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:59,800
I'm gonna kill you.

2518
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:01,800
No, no, no!

2519
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:03,800
You're gonna die?

2520
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:05,800
I want to have sex more.

2521
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,800
I want to have sex more.

2522
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,800
I don't want to laugh.

2523
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,800
I want to put it in.

2524
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:21,800
I want to put it in.

2525
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:25,800
I'm sweating.

2526
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,800
I'm sweating.

2527
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:29,800
I'm sweating.

2528
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:31,800
I'm sweating.

2529
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:33,800
Are you okay?

2530
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:35,800
I'm okay again.

2531
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:37,800
I'm sorry.

2532
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:39,800
I'll take it off for you.

2533
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:41,800
I see.

2534
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:43,800
I'm sorry.

2535
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,800
Do you feel good?

2536
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:49,800
I feel good.

2537
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,800
Open your eyes.

2538
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:57,800
What is it?

2539
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:59,800
It's dangerous.

2540
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,800
Oh my god!

2541
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:03,800
Oh my god!

2542
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:05,800
Shin-san!

2543
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,800
Are you okay?

2544
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:11,800
I feel good!

2545
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:13,800
I feel good!

2546
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:15,800
I feel good!

2547
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:17,800
I feel good!

2548
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:21,800
It's me!

2549
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:23,800
It's me!

2550
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,800
I feel good!

2551
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,800
I feel good!

2552
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,800
I'm happy.

2553
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:31,800
I'm sorry.

2554
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:33,800
I want to die.

2555
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,800
I'm not done yet.

2556
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,800
I can't do it.

2557
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,800
I can't do it.

2558
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:48,800
It's too painful.

2559
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,800
I'm not done yet.

2560
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,800
I'm not done yet.

2561
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,800
I'm not done yet.

2562
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:56,800
Let's make it fast.

2563
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:58,800
What?

2564
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:00,800
Are you going to die?

2565
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,800
I'm going to die.

2566
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:04,800
It's okay.

2567
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:06,800
It's okay.

2568
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,800
No.

2569
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,800
I'm going to move.

2570
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,800
What?

2571
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,800
I'm going to move.

2572
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,800
Nono-chan.

2573
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,800
I'm going to move.

2574
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,800
Do you want this photo?

2575
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:28,800
I don't think you need this photo.

2576
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:30,800
I don't need it either.

2577
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,800
What if I use it?

2578
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,800
I want to move it.

2579
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,800
I want to move it.

2580
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,800
Do you want to move it?

2581
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,800
Please.

2582
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:42,800
I want to move it.

2583
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,800
You're so quick.

2584
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:46,800
I want to move it.

2585
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,800
You can move it.

2586
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:50,800
Thank you.

2587
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:52,800
Let's go to the bathroom.

2588
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,800
I can't stand it.

2589
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,800
Can I go to the bathroom?

2590
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,800
Yes, please.

2591
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:00,800
Let's go to the bathroom.

2592
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,800
Let's go to the bathroom.

2593
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:10,800
How do you feel?

2594
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,800
Let me see.

2595
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:14,800
Are you serious?

2596
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,800
Are you serious?

2597
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,800
Are you trying to move by yourself?

2598
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,800
This is erotic, isn't it?

2599
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:51,800
Yes, yes.

2600
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:53,800
This picture is dangerous.

2601
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:55,800
Is it dangerous?

2602
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:57,800
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

2603
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:59,800
It's faster than zoom, zoom, zoom.

2604
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:01,800
It's really fast.

2605
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,800
Are you going?

2606
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:07,800
I did my best.

2607
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:09,800
You did your best.

2608
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:11,800
Am I?

2609
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:12,800
I'm just saying because I want to tease you.

2610
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,800
I don't know.

2611
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,800
Am I?

2612
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:15,800
It's love. Love.

2613
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,800
Is it love?

2614
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:17,800
Love.

2615
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:19,800
That's not love.

2616
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:21,800
It's love in Karuizawa.

2617
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:23,800
It's love in Karuizawa.

2618
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:25,800
It's love in Karuizawa.

2619
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:27,800
Give me a kiss.

2620
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,800
That way?

2621
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,800
That way?

2622
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:33,800
Not that way?

2623
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:35,800
Not that way?

2624
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:37,800
What's going on?

2625
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,800
What's going on?

2626
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:11,800
Love...I'm sorry.

2627
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:13,800
That love...

2628
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,800
What are you doing?

2629
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:17,800
No, no.

2630
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:19,800
Like this.

2631
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,800
It's like heaven.

2632
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:23,800
It's amazing.

2633
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:25,800
It's amazing.

2634
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:27,800
It's amazing.

2635
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:29,800
It's amazing.

2636
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:31,800
It's amazing.

2637
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:33,800
It's biting.

2638
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:35,800
It's biting.

2639
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:37,800
How is it?

2640
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:39,800
What is this?

2641
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:41,800
This is the birth of Karuizawa.

2642
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:49,800
This is dangerous.

2643
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:22,800
What are you doing, Momo-chan?

2644
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,800
Look at her.

2645
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:26,800
Look at the woman.

2646
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,800
Look at the woman.

2647
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,800
That's right.

2648
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:33,800
Chikabe, Chikabe, Chikabe.

2649
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:34,800
Do you want to try it?

2650
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:51,800
Good job!

2651
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:53,800
You drank too much!

2652
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:56,800
You drank too much!

2653
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:58,800
You drank too much!

2654
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:00,800
I don't want to do this!

2655
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:04,800
I don't want to do this!

2656
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:07,800
I don't want to do this!

2657
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:10,800
I'm going! I'm going!

2658
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,800
I'm going! I'm going!

2659
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,800
This feels good!

2660
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:26,800
I want to do a backflip!

2661
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:28,800
I want to hug you.

2662
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,800
I want to hug you.

2663
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,800
I want to hug you from behind.

2664
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,800
I love you.

2665
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:34,800
I love you too.

2666
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,800
I'll open your hips.

2667
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:47,800
I'm sorry.

2668
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:48,800
I'm sorry.

2669
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:49,800
I'm sorry.

2670
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:50,800
I'm sorry.

2671
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:52,800
Good!

2672
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:56,800
Can you see it?

2673
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,800
I can see it

2674
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:01,800
I feel so good

2675
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:10,800
I feel so good

2676
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,800
I'm going to be killed if I get caught.

2677
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,800
It's okay if you don't get caught.

2678
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,800
It feels good.

2679
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:00,800
Spread it out.

2680
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:01,800
Can you see it?

2681
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:03,800
I can see it.

2682
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:05,800
You wanted to see it, didn't you?

2683
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,800
I'm glad you're here.

2684
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:15,800
What are you doing?

2685
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:19,800
Hurry up.

2686
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,800
Hime-chan is waiting for you.

2687
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:23,800
I'm talking about Kuri-onna Shora.

2688
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:25,800
Hurry up.

2689
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:29,800
Where do you want to put it?

2690
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:33,800
Back.

2691
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:35,800
It's dangerous, so move to the side.

2692
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:37,800
It's dangerous, so move to the side.

2693
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:39,800
Gumi-chan, sorry.

2694
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:41,800
Thank you.

2695
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:43,800
I'm great.

2696
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:45,800
I'm great.

2697
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:47,800
Come on, come on.

2698
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:49,800
Don't put your head down too much.

2699
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,800
You'll get a cramp in your neck.

2700
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,800
It's not here.

2701
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,800
Is it in?

2702
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:27,800
I don't like this

2703
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,800
This is good

2704
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:31,800
This is really good

2705
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:33,800
It's hot

2706
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,800
It's so hot

2707
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,800
This is so hot

2708
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,800
I'm so hot

2709
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:41,800
I'm so hot

2710
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:43,800
It doesn't have air

2711
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:45,800
I'm so hot

2712
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:47,800
No, it's not good

2713
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:49,800
You are so hot

2714
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:51,800
You are so hot

2715
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:53,800
You are so hot

2716
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:55,800
It's like a boyfriend

2717
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:59,800
Don't you want to show your boyfriend?

2718
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:01,800
Don't you want to show your boyfriend?

2719
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:03,800
It's annoying

2720
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:05,800
It's annoying because it's the first week

2721
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,800
That's right, I don't say anything

2722
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:09,800
That's right

2723
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,800
But in fact

2724
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,800
You say it

2725
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:15,800
I don't want to come when I'm sleeping

2726
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:17,800
That's right

2727
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:19,800
You want to go?

2728
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:21,800
You want to go?

2729
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:35,800
You went?

2730
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:37,800
Oh no

2731
02:30:37,800 --> 02:30:39,800
I'm so tired

2732
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,800
Do you want to go in more?

2733
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,800
Are you okay?

2734
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:49,800
Are you okay?

2735
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:51,800
Do you like to move your hips?

2736
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,800
No, I'm fine.

2737
02:30:53,800 --> 02:30:55,800
I'll listen to you.

2738
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:57,800
Are you okay?

2739
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,800
I'll open the door.

2740
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,800
I'll open it.

2741
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:03,800
Are you okay?

2742
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:09,800
You're in there.

2743
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:11,800
You're in there.

2744
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:13,800
I'm so hungry.

2745
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:16,800
How do you feel?

2746
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:18,800
I feel so good.

2747
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:20,800
I feel like my husband.

2748
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:37,800
I feel so good.

2749
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,800
Ouch!

2750
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,800
Ouch!

2751
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:43,800
It really hurts.

2752
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:45,800
It really hurts.

2753
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:47,800
It's scary.

2754
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:53,800
It's blood.

2755
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:55,800
No, no, no.

2756
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,800
I wanted to go.

2757
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:59,800
Sorry, sorry.

2758
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:01,800
Look at the camera.

2759
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:16,800
I'm sorry.

2760
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:18,800
What?

2761
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:20,800
Let go of me.

2762
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:24,800
It feels good.

2763
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:32,800
Oh, no.

2764
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:37,800
Oh, no.

2765
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:39,800
Let's go.

2766
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:41,800
Oh, no.

2767
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:43,800
Oh my god!

2768
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:45,800
What?

2769
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:47,800
I got it!

2770
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,800
Did you see it?

2771
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,800
I got it!

2772
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:53,800
Did you get it?

2773
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:55,800
Did you get it?

2774
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:57,800
I got it!

2775
02:32:57,800 --> 02:32:59,800
You drank too much!

2776
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:01,800
You drank too much!

2777
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:03,800
Oh my god!

2778
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:05,800
It's amazing!

2779
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:07,800
Who is it?

2780
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,800
Tissue?

2781
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:44,800
I want to shoot too.

2782
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:47,800
I don't like this guy.

2783
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:49,800
It's boring.

2784
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:51,800
What do you mean?

2785
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:55,800
It's a cat fall.

2786
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:58,800
Let's do it together.

2787
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:00,800
I'm sorry.

2788
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:02,800
I'm sorry.

2789
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,800
I'm sorry.

2790
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:10,800
This is not funny at all.

2791
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,800
This is very erotic.

2792
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:16,800
This is very erotic.

2793
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:24,800
What is this footwork?

2794
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:28,800
Please do this with one hand.

2795
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:31,800
This is a good memory.

2796
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:36,800
It's coming out.

2797
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,800
I want to see it coming out.

2798
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:41,800
I'm going.

2799
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:44,800
I'm going.

2800
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:45,800
I'm going to do it.

2801
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:51,800
I'm going to do it.

2802
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:00,800
It's like a grudge.

2803
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:02,800
It's still coming out.

2804
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:05,800
It's not coming out yet.

2805
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:07,800
It's not coming out anymore.

2806
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:09,800
It's really coming out.

2807
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:11,800
That's amazing.

2808
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,800
That's amazing.

2809
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,800
That's amazing.

2810
02:35:15,800 --> 02:35:17,800
You're licking it.

2811
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:19,800
You're licking it.

2812
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:21,800
You're licking it.

2813
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:23,800
You're licking it.

2814
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:25,800
You're licking it.

2815
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:27,800
You're licking it.

2816
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:29,800
What's the taste of the food?

2817
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:31,800
It's hot.

2818
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:35,800
This is amazing.

2819
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:37,800
It's the one from Karuizawa.

2820
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:38,800
Is it dirty?

2821
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:39,800
It's light.

2822
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:40,800
It's dirty.

2823
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:42,800
Give me a tissue.

2824
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:44,800
Sorry.

2825
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,800
Come on in.

2826
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:48,800
Come on in.

2827
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:50,800
It's a living thing.

2828
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:51,800
It's dirty.

2829
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,800
It's really dirty.

2830
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:55,800
It's really dirty.

2831
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:58,800
It's more dirty than a boyfriend.

2832
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:01,800
It's like a dirty gelatine.

2833
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:03,800
It feels really good.

2834
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:05,800
What is it?

2835
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:07,300
Thank you.

2836
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:08,300
Thank you.

2837
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:09,300
Thank you.

2838
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:10,300
Thanks.

2839
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:12,300
It's over.

2840
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:15,300
Yasu, get in the car.

2841
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:17,300
Yasu, get in the car.

2842
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:19,300
Yeah!

2843
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:21,300
Yasu, get in the car.

2844
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:23,300
Yasu, get in the car.

2845
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:25,300
Yasu, get in the car.

2846
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:27,300
He got in the car.

2847
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:30,300
It's the best when you go home.

2848
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:33,300
The best when you go home.

2849
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:36,300
Can you say something to your boyfriend?

2850
02:36:36,300 --> 02:36:39,300
I'm sorry that I'm more comfortable than my boyfriend.

2851
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:41,300
Me too.

2852
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:43,300
Can you pay attention to me?

2853
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:45,300
Really?

2854
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:47,300
Are you really paying attention to me?

2855
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:49,300
It's good.

2856
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:51,300
Let's drink.

2857
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:53,300
Let's drink.

2858
02:36:53,300 --> 02:36:55,300
We can still go.

2859
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:57,300
It's a long night.

2860
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:59,300
This is really bad.

2861
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:01,300
Monoko.

2862
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:05,300
He's doing it with Yuna.

2863
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:12,300
Really?

2864
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:14,300
He's really attacking the guy.

2865
02:37:14,300 --> 02:37:16,300
He's totally drunk.

2866
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:18,300
He's drunk.

2867
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:22,300
He's stubborn, right?

2868
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:28,300
I don't want to say this, but...

2869
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:30,300
Wait a minute.

2870
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:32,300
I'm going to hit you.

2871
02:37:32,300 --> 02:37:34,300
I'm going to hit you.

2872
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:36,300
I'm sorry.

2873
02:37:36,300 --> 02:37:38,300
You're so mean.

2874
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:40,300
I'm sorry.

2875
02:37:40,300 --> 02:37:44,300
I've never seen such a mean actor.

2876
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:46,300
I'm sorry.

2877
02:37:46,300 --> 02:37:48,300
I'm really sorry.

2878
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:50,300
I'm going to hit you.

2879
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:52,300
I'm going to hit you.

2880
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:54,300
I'm so pissed off.

2881
02:37:54,300 --> 02:37:56,300
I'm so pissed off.

2882
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:00,300
I don't care about myself.

2883
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:04,300
I don't care about myself.

2884
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:08,300
It's fun!

2885
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:10,300
It's the best.

2886
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,300
It's delicious!

2887
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:17,300
It's delicious!

2888
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:19,300
What are you doing?

2889
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:20,300
I don't know.

2890
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:52,300
You were spinning around before.

2891
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:54,300
Wait a minute.

2892
02:38:54,300 --> 02:38:56,300
No, no.

2893
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:58,300
I'm sorry.

2894
02:38:58,300 --> 02:39:00,300
I'm sorry.

2895
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:02,300
I'm sorry.

2896
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:04,300
Gather around.

2897
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:06,300
Gather around.

2898
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:08,300
Gather around.

2899
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:10,300
Gather around.

2900
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:12,300
It's too good.

2901
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:14,300
Let's drink.

2902
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:16,300
Let's drink.

2903
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:18,300
Let's drink.

2904
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:20,300
Cheers!

2905
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:22,300
Let's drink!

2906
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:25,300
Let's drink!

2907
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:28,300
Oh, it's coming!

2908
02:39:28,300 --> 02:39:30,300
It's coming!

2909
02:39:34,300 --> 02:39:36,300
Cheers!

2910
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:38,300
Oh, my God!

2911
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:41,300
I'm a little dizzy.

2912
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:43,300
Do you want to drink something?

2913
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,300
I drink!

2914
02:39:44,300 --> 02:39:46,300
Then I'll bring it.

2915
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:48,300
Let's read it together.

2916
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:51,300
What are you guys doing?

2917
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:53,300
I don't know. I'm still sleepy.

2918
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:55,300
It's pretty easy.

2919
02:39:55,300 --> 02:39:57,300
It's a rare reaction.

2920
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:59,300
It's a rare reaction.

2921
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:01,300
It's a rare reaction.

2922
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:03,300
It's a rare reaction.

2923
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:05,300
Bring it here.

2924
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:07,300
Bring it here.

2925
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:09,300
It's amazing.

2926
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:11,300
What's with the pants?

2927
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:13,300
Isn't that yogurt?

2928
02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:15,300
It's a dot com.

2929
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:17,300
I don't feel good when I do this.

2930
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:19,300
I want to talk too much.

2931
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:21,300
Come here.

2932
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:23,300
Come here.

2933
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:25,300
I'm not talking to you.

2934
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:27,300
Come here.

2935
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:31,300
What?

2936
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:33,300
What are you doing?

2937
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,300
What are you doing?

2938
02:40:35,300 --> 02:40:37,300
What are you doing?

2939
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:39,300
What are you doing?

2940
02:40:39,300 --> 02:40:41,300
What is that?

2941
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:43,300
What is that?

2942
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:44,300
What are you doing?

2943
02:40:44,300 --> 02:40:45,300
What?

2944
02:40:46,300 --> 02:40:47,300
What?

2945
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:51,300
They are all naked.

2946
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:56,300
What are you guys doing?

2947
02:40:56,300 --> 02:40:57,300
You can tell by looking.

2948
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:58,300
It's a sacrosanctus.

2949
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:01,300
What are you doing?

2950
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:03,300
What are you doing?

2951
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:04,300
It's a sacrosanctus.

2952
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:07,300
It's a sacrosanctus.

2953
02:41:07,300 --> 02:41:08,300
What are you doing?

2954
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:10,300
What are you doing?

2955
02:41:10,300 --> 02:41:12,300
What are you doing?

2956
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:14,300
What are you doing?

2957
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:19,300
You guys are so dirty.

2958
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:23,300
The last one.

2959
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,300
I haven't seen the last one for a long time.

2960
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:27,300
What are you doing?

2961
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:29,300
I'm talking to you.

2962
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:31,300
Is it a Jack?

2963
02:41:31,300 --> 02:41:33,300
Why is it an item Jack?

2964
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:35,300
What are you doing?

2965
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:37,300
Don't throw it away.

2966
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:39,300
It's really dirty.

2967
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:41,300
Did you write something to drink?

2968
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:43,300
Let's drink.

2969
02:41:43,300 --> 02:41:45,300
That's crazy.

2970
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:47,300
That's crazy.

2971
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:49,300
There's nothing to say.

2972
02:41:49,300 --> 02:41:51,300
It was nice.

2973
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,300
Let's drink.

2974
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:55,300
Let's drink.

2975
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:57,300
Let's drink.

2976
02:41:57,300 --> 02:41:59,300
Let's drink.

2977
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:01,300
Let's drink.

2978
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:03,300
Let's drink.

2979
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:05,300
Let's drink.

2980
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:09,300
Let's drink something to celebrate.

2981
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:11,300
What is it?

2982
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:13,300
Kuruizaki?

2983
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:15,300
Solari.

2984
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:17,300
Solari for everyone.

2985
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:19,300
Don't you want to draw Solari's face?

2986
02:42:19,300 --> 02:42:21,300
What is it?

2987
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,300
Hakurei's expression is getting softer.

2988
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:25,300
He is being embraced by kindness.

2989
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:27,300
What is it?

2990
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:29,300
He is being embraced by kindness.

2991
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:31,300
What is it?

2992
02:42:31,300 --> 02:42:33,300
What did you do?

2993
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:35,300
What did you do?

2994
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:37,300
I didn't do anything.

2995
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:39,300
Be honest.

2996
02:42:39,300 --> 02:42:41,300
I was talking to you.

2997
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:43,300
I was talking to you.

2998
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:45,300
Let's toast to what we've done.

2999
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,300
Let's toast to the next sex!

3000
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:49,300
Yeah!

3001
02:42:49,300 --> 02:42:51,300
Sex is the best!

3002
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:53,300
Sex is the best!

3003
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:55,300
Oh, no!

3004
02:42:55,300 --> 02:42:57,300
Cheers!

3005
02:42:57,300 --> 02:42:59,300
Cheers!

3006
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:01,300
Sex is the best!

3007
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:03,300
You're the best!

3008
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:05,300
You're so annoying.

3009
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:09,300
You shouldn't have done that.

3010
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:17,300
You're so annoying.

3011
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:21,300
I'm sorry.

3012
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:23,300
What are you talking about?

3013
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:25,300
It can't be helped.

3014
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:29,300
You're so annoying.

3015
02:43:29,300 --> 02:43:32,300
You're not going to do this in the fall, are you?

3016
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:33,300
What?

3017
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:34,300
You're not going to do it?

3018
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:35,300
No way.

3019
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:36,300
You're not going to do it?

3020
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:37,300
I should think about it.

3021
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:39,300
You should talk about it.

3022
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,300
You should talk about it.

3023
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:41,300
I can't.

3024
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:43,300
You can't do anything.

3025
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:45,300
But I'll be a little bit nervous.

3026
02:43:45,300 --> 02:43:46,300
Seriously.

3027
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:47,300
What are you talking about?

3028
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:48,300
Ah!

3029
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:49,300
Sorry.

3030
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:50,300
Well, well, well.

3031
02:43:50,300 --> 02:43:51,300
Well, well, well.

3032
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:52,300
Once.

3033
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:53,300
I'm sorry.

3034
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:54,300
You should talk about it once.

3035
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:55,300
But again.

3036
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:56,300
It's starting.

3037
02:43:56,300 --> 02:43:57,300
It's starting.

3038
02:43:57,300 --> 02:43:58,300
What?

3039
02:43:58,300 --> 02:44:00,300
I don't know.

3040
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:02,300
Really?

3041
02:44:10,300 --> 02:44:12,300
Sex is the best!

3042
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:14,300
I got sex is the best!

3043
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:16,300
What?

3044
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:18,300
I got sex is the best!

3045
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:20,300
Sex is the best!

3046
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:22,300
Telo-telo!

3047
02:44:22,300 --> 02:44:24,300
Telo-telo!

3048
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:26,300
I know these three are going to do it, but I didn't expect it.

3049
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:28,300
What is this?

3050
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:30,300
I'm sorry!

3051
02:44:30,300 --> 02:44:32,300
I was talking about it earlier.

3052
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:34,300
I was talking about it earlier.

3053
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:36,300
It's very erotic.

3054
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:38,300
I said it's very erotic.

3055
02:44:38,300 --> 02:44:40,300
I was wearing clothes and I didn't do anything.

3056
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:44,300
This is because I went to the bathroom.

3057
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:46,300
What?

3058
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:48,300
I'm sorry.

3059
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:50,300
It's very bad.

3060
02:44:50,300 --> 02:44:52,300
Good job.

3061
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:54,300
I don't like the troublemaker.

3062
02:44:54,300 --> 02:44:57,300
What does that mean?

3063
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:59,300
I can't forgive you for that.

3064
02:45:02,300 --> 02:45:04,300
What?

3065
02:45:04,300 --> 02:45:06,300
What?

3066
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:09,300
Misa, didn't you say you love Kareppippi?

3067
02:45:09,300 --> 02:45:11,300
I love Kareppippi.

3068
02:45:11,300 --> 02:45:13,300
What are you doing now?

3069
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,300
You saw something, didn't you?

3070
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:21,300
I did.

3071
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:22,300
What did you do?

3072
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:24,300
There was a chinko in the mango.

3073
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:26,300
Replay it. Replay it.

3074
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:28,300
Replay it. How was it?

3075
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:30,300
Like this.

3076
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:32,300
Like this.

3077
02:45:32,300 --> 02:45:34,300
Like this.

3078
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:36,300
Like this.

3079
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:38,300
It's perfect.

3080
02:45:38,300 --> 02:45:40,300
It's perfect.

3081
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:42,300
Replay it.

3082
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:44,300
Other parts.

3083
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:46,300
Replay VTR?

3084
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:48,300
I heard it when I was patting my butt.

3085
02:45:48,300 --> 02:45:50,300
Like this.

3086
02:45:50,300 --> 02:45:52,300
Wow, that's great!

3087
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:56,300
Attack! Attack!

3088
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:08,300
It's been a while since we did this.

3089
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:41,300
Can you lick it?

3090
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:13,300
I'm sorry!

3091
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:15,300
I'm sorry!

3092
02:47:15,300 --> 02:47:17,300
Me too?

3093
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:19,300
Me too?

3094
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:21,300
I'm sorry!

3095
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:23,300
Wait!

3096
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:25,300
Cute!

3097
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:27,300
I'm sorry!

3098
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,300
I'm sorry!

3099
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:31,300
I'm sorry!

3100
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:33,300
I don't need it anymore!

3101
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:35,300
I'm sorry!

3102
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,300
I'm sorry!

3103
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:39,300
I'm sorry!

3104
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:41,300
It's delicious.

3105
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:43,300
Chimpanzee, do your best.

3106
02:47:46,300 --> 02:47:47,300
Is it delicious?

3107
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:48,300
Yes.

3108
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:50,300
Is it delicious?

3109
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:51,300
Yes, it's delicious.

3110
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:52,300
Chimpanzee, is it delicious?

3111
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:53,300
Yes.

3112
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:55,300
Good job.

3113
02:47:56,300 --> 02:47:58,300
She said she didn't do anything.

3114
02:47:58,300 --> 02:48:00,300
You're amazing.

3115
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:01,300
I didn't do anything.

3116
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:03,300
What is that eating?

3117
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:06,300
Don't underestimate me.

3118
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:07,300
What?

3119
02:48:07,300 --> 02:48:11,300
I lick it as long as there is a chimp here.

3120
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:13,300
It's like I've heard of it.

3121
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:15,300
It's cool.

3122
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:19,300
Oh no, oh no.

3123
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:24,300
Misa's body.

3124
02:48:24,300 --> 02:48:26,300
Misa's body is so strong.

3125
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:29,300
Oh no, oh no.

3126
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:31,300
How about that one?

3127
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:32,300
Oh, no, no.

3128
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:33,300
Oh, no, no.

3129
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:34,300
Oh, no, no.

3130
02:48:34,300 --> 02:48:35,300
Oh, no, no.

3131
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:37,500
It's so good.

3132
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:39,300
It's so good.

3133
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:43,100
I'm going to train you a lot from now on.

3134
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:45,000
She's a good girl.

3135
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,300
Good girl.

3136
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:49,900
Let's sit over here.

3137
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:52,100
Let's compare.

3138
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:53,200
Let's compare.

3139
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:55,600
You want to compare?

3140
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:58,200
Let's compare.

3141
02:48:58,200 --> 02:49:01,000
Good girl.

3142
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
She's amazing.

3143
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Was Sona really that erotic?

3144
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
She's really erotic.

3145
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
It's amazing.

3146
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
This way, this way.

3147
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
This is amazing.

3148
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Let's take a picture of you.

3149
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
This is amazing.

3150
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
This is amazing.

3151
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
This is amazing.

3152
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
This is amazing.

3153
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
This is amazing.

3154
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Everyone is moving their chips.

3155
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I'm also a chip.

3156
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
What do you mean?

3157
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
I'm a chip.

3158
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
I'm a chip.

3159
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
I'm working on a chip.

3160
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Let's exchange.

3161
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Let's move around and go around.

3162
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I'm also a chip.

3163
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Oh, that feels good.

3164
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Oh, that feels good.

3165
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Oh, that's a little...

3166
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Oh, Chikkun, no, it's coming out.

3167
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
It's coming out, it's coming out.

3168
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
It's coming out, it's coming out.

3169
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
It's coming out, it's coming out.

3170
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Oh, stop it, Chikkun.

3171
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I'm so happy.

3172
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
It's like that.

3173
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Oh, that looks fun.

3174
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Oh, I'm so happy.

3175
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
I'm so happy.

3176
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Oh, I'm so happy.

3177
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
I'm so happy.

3178
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
It's hot.

3179
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Oh, my God.

3180
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Oh, my God.

3181
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Oh, my God.

3182
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Oh, my God.

3183
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Oh, my God.

3184
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
I haven't seen it yet.

3185
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
She is so beautiful.

3186
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Yes, she is.

3187
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
I thought I couldn't see her.

3188
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Let me help you.

3189
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I'm sleepy.

3190
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
I'm sleepy.

3191
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Let's talk.

3192
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I want to lick my butt.

3193
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I want to lick it too.

3194
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
He's licking it.

3195
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Amazing.

3196
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
I want to lick it.

3197
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
So cute.

3198
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
He's licking something.

3199
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
You're the best.

3200
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
You're the best again.

3201
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Amazing.

3202
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
It feels good. Is it good?

3203
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Give me a kiss.

3204
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
You want me to lick it?

3205
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
You want me to lick it?

3206
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I want to lick 699.

3207
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
You want me to lick 699?

3208
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
You are very good at it, Soma.

3209
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
It's surprising.

3210
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
You are the best at it.

3211
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
What?

3212
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
You are the best at it.

3213
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
You are the best at it.

3214
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
You are the best at it.

3215
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Give your husband a word.

3216
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:12,000
I'm sorry for today. It's fun.

3217
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Which do you like more, your boyfriend or us?

3218
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
I like this one.

3219
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:21,000
You like your boyfriend, don't you?

3220
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I like this one.

3221
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Do you like this one?

3222
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yes.

3223
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,000
You're so cute.

3224
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:27,000
I don't want to go.

3225
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
What?

3226
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,000
I don't want to go.

3227
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Can I go?

3228
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Yes, you can.

3229
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
But I don't want to go.

3230
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:36,000
If you go, I won't let you in.

3231
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
I don't want to go.

3232
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Why are you trying to put it in another child?

3233
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:41,000
No, I won't put it in.

3234
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:42,000
You won't put it in?

3235
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I won't put it in.

3236
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:44,000
I won't put it in.

3237
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:45,000
I won't put it in.

3238
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
You're going to open your buttocks a lot.

3239
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:48,000
You're going to open your buttocks a lot.

3240
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Are you trying to put it in so that you can't put it in another child?

3241
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Hey, please.

3242
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
I won't put it in.

3243
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:58,000
The country is amazing.

3244
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
How do you do this?

3245
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
It's the other way around.

3246
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
No way, I'm over there.

3247
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
It's like this.

3248
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:28,000
You can do anything as long as you have a chinchin.

3249
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
You can do anything as long as you have a chinchin.

3250
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
But you don't like chinchin, do you?

3251
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I want to put it in my mouth.

3252
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I want to put it in my mouth.

3253
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Oh, my God.

3254
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
I'm going to cut it.

3255
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
It's a little embarrassing, but...

3256
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Oh, my God.

3257
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Oh, my God.

3258
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
It's okay. Just a little bit.

3259
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
I'm sorry.

3260
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Oh, no.

3261
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Mango is disgusting.

3262
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Mango is the best.

3263
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Thank you for your hard work.

3264
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Thank you for your hard work.

3265
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Chimpanzee is the best.

3266
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Thank you for your hard work.

3267
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
I told you that everyone's chimpanzee is mine.

3268
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Everyone is licking me.

3269
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
It's terrible.

3270
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Isn't it the smallest?

3271
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Shut up!

3272
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Isn't it the smallest?

3273
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
I'm worried.

3274
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
You'll get tired.

3275
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Try to get tired.

3276
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Try to get tired.

3277
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
High-speed technique.

3278
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
You haven't won yet.

3279
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Really?

3280
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
You didn't like strawberries.

3281
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:24,260
I like strawberry one more.

3282
02:58:24,480 --> 02:58:26,480
I like the strawberry one more.

3283
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:28,080
You like strawberry one more.

3284
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:30,080
But you like the chimpanzee one more.

3285
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:32,080
Which one do you like more?

3286
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:34,080
I like strawberry one more.

3287
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:36,080
But I like chimpanzee one more.

3288
02:58:36,080 --> 02:58:38,080
Yeah!

3289
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:40,080
Cheese!

3290
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:42,080
Cheese!

3291
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:44,080
I can see the chimpanzee one more.

3292
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:46,080
I can see it.

3293
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:48,080
Look!

3294
02:58:48,080 --> 02:58:50,080
Captain!

3295
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:24,080
You didn't say a word to your boyfriend, did you?

3296
02:59:24,080 --> 02:59:26,080
I love Kareppippi.

3297
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:28,080
Is it okay? We do this kind of thing.

3298
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:30,080
Because I don't see this, Kareppi.

3299
02:59:30,080 --> 02:59:32,080
I don't see it, but let's say you were watching this.

3300
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:34,080
A word of thanks.

3301
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:36,080
If you were watching.

3302
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:42,080
Kareppippi has a small population, so it's hard to do it.

3303
02:59:42,080 --> 02:59:44,080
Bye-bye.

3304
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:46,080
It's terrible.

3305
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:48,080
It's terrible.

3306
02:59:50,080 --> 02:59:52,080
It's a princess.

3307
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:02,080
It's coming.

3308
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:04,080
It's coming.

3309
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:06,080
It's coming.

3310
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:08,080
It's coming.

3311
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:10,080
What is this?

3312
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:12,080
Wow, look over here.

3313
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:20,080
Something's coming out.

3314
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:22,080
Something's coming out.

3315
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:24,080
The alcohol has come out.

3316
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:28,080
It's detoxing.

3317
03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:32,080
There's a lot of it.

3318
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:34,080
There's a lot of it.

3319
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:36,080
No, that's mine.

3320
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:39,080
I'm the one who's crying.

3321
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:41,080
You can't do that.

3322
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:43,080
You have to lick it.

3323
03:00:50,080 --> 03:00:52,080
Double penis?

3324
03:00:52,080 --> 03:00:53,080
No way.

3325
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:54,080
Look at Beech-kun.

3326
03:00:54,080 --> 03:00:56,080
Beech-kun is waiting.

3327
03:00:56,080 --> 03:00:57,080
Cute bunny.

3328
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:00,080
Amazing.

3329
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:03,080
Why are you filming the camera?

3330
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:05,080
It's not raw.

3331
03:01:05,080 --> 03:01:07,080
No, it's not.

3332
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:09,080
It's going to break, isn't it?

3333
03:01:09,080 --> 03:01:11,080
It's going to break, isn't it?

3334
03:01:11,080 --> 03:01:13,080
It's going to break, isn't it?

3335
03:01:13,080 --> 03:01:15,080
It's going to break, isn't it?

3336
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:17,080
It's the best.

3337
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:19,080
I want to put it in.

3338
03:01:19,080 --> 03:01:21,080
Do you want it?

3339
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:23,080
I want to put it in, too.

3340
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:25,080
It's the last one.

3341
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:27,080
Do you want it?

3342
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:29,080
Let's put it in raw.

3343
03:01:29,080 --> 03:01:31,080
Let's put it in.

3344
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:33,080
I told you not to do so!

3345
03:01:33,080 --> 03:01:35,080
I told you not to do so!

3346
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:37,080
No, no, no, no.

3347
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:39,080
I said so.

3348
03:01:39,080 --> 03:01:41,080
No, no, no.

3349
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:43,080
Look, she is going to go in.

3350
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:45,080
No, I'm not.

3351
03:01:45,080 --> 03:01:47,080
She is going in.

3352
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:49,080
I told you not to do so.

3353
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:51,080
No, no, no.

3354
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:53,080
No, I can't.

3355
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:55,080
No, I can't.

3356
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:57,080
No, I can't.

3357
03:01:57,080 --> 03:01:59,080
No, I can't.

3358
03:01:59,080 --> 03:02:03,080
Wow, it feels so good.

3359
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:10,080
It feels so good.

3360
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:21,080
This is the view I can see from here.

3361
03:02:22,080 --> 03:02:25,080
This is the view I can see from here.

3362
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:28,080
It's amazing.

3363
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:31,080
Sorai-chan is amazing.

3364
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:33,080
Can I put it in raw?

3365
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:35,080
Hime-chan's?

3366
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:37,080
Sorai-chan's is raw.

3367
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:39,080
Can I put it in raw?

3368
03:02:39,080 --> 03:02:41,080
Can I put it in raw?

3369
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:45,080
Why do you put it in raw?

3370
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:47,080
Do you want me to take it off?

3371
03:02:47,080 --> 03:02:49,080
It's gross.

3372
03:02:49,080 --> 03:02:51,080
Can you take it off here?

3373
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:53,080
I can't do it.

3374
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:57,080
It hurts.

3375
03:03:01,080 --> 03:03:03,080
It hurts so much.

3376
03:03:03,080 --> 03:03:04,080
I'm scared.

3377
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:14,080
It feels great.

3378
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:23,080
Amazing.

3379
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:27,080
It's intense.

3380
03:03:27,080 --> 03:03:29,080
Do you feel good?

3381
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:31,080
Do you feel good?

3382
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:03,000
You are not feeling good?

3383
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,220
Not quite, you know.

3384
03:04:04,220 --> 03:04:05,200
Why???

3385
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,200
Ah!

3386
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:07,200
Mino-chan, what do you think?

3387
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:09,220
Ochi-in-po!

3388
03:04:09,220 --> 03:04:10,220
Ochi-in-po!

3389
03:04:10,220 --> 03:04:11,220
Ochi-in-po!

3390
03:04:11,220 --> 03:04:12,220
Why?

3391
03:04:12,220 --> 03:04:13,220
Ochi-in-po!

3392
03:04:13,220 --> 03:04:14,220
Ochi-in-po!

3393
03:04:14,220 --> 03:04:15,220
What??

3394
03:04:15,220 --> 03:04:16,220
Ochi-in-po!

3395
03:04:16,220 --> 03:04:17,220
Ochi-in-po!

3396
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:18,220
Why??

3397
03:04:18,220 --> 03:04:19,220
Soran-chan, you are not feeling good?

3398
03:04:19,220 --> 03:04:20,220
Why??

3399
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:21,220
Ochi-in-po!

3400
03:04:21,220 --> 03:04:22,220
Why??

3401
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:23,220
Why?

3402
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:24,220
Why?

3403
03:04:24,220 --> 03:04:25,220
Ochi-in-po!

3404
03:04:25,220 --> 03:04:26,220
Ochi-in-po!

3405
03:04:26,220 --> 03:04:27,220
Why?

3406
03:04:27,220 --> 03:04:28,220
Ochi-in-po!

3407
03:04:28,220 --> 03:04:29,220
Ochi-in-po!

3408
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:30,220
Ochi-in-po!

3409
03:04:30,220 --> 03:04:32,220
I don't want to do it.

3410
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:40,220
It feels good.

3411
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:49,220
Don't let go.

3412
03:04:50,220 --> 03:04:52,220
It feels so good.

3413
03:05:22,220 --> 03:05:24,220
Wow, look at that.

3414
03:05:24,220 --> 03:05:25,220
Amazing.

3415
03:05:29,220 --> 03:05:31,220
Oh, no.

3416
03:05:37,220 --> 03:05:39,220
Everyone, do you feel good?

3417
03:05:40,220 --> 03:05:42,220
Everyone, do you feel good?

3418
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:45,220
Everyone, do you feel good?

3419
03:05:45,220 --> 03:05:47,220
Do you feel good?

3420
03:05:47,220 --> 03:05:49,220
Do you feel good?

3421
03:05:49,220 --> 03:05:51,220
It's so funny.

3422
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:53,220
Is it funny?

3423
03:05:53,220 --> 03:05:55,220
It's so funny.

3424
03:05:58,220 --> 03:06:00,220
It's so funny.

3425
03:06:00,220 --> 03:06:02,220
It would be great if you were my boyfriend.

3426
03:06:02,220 --> 03:06:04,220
I don't care.

3427
03:06:16,220 --> 03:06:18,220
It's so funny.

3428
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:20,220
Oh my god.

3429
03:07:20,220 --> 03:07:22,220
I feel so bad.

3430
03:07:22,220 --> 03:07:24,220
I feel so bad.

3431
03:07:34,220 --> 03:07:36,220
Oh my god.

3432
03:07:39,220 --> 03:07:41,220
What do you want to eat?

3433
03:07:41,220 --> 03:07:43,220
Lasso Fella?

3434
03:07:43,220 --> 03:07:48,220
You don't talk much, but you have the most potential to be a skater, don't you?

3435
03:07:48,220 --> 03:07:50,220
I have the most potential.

3436
03:07:50,220 --> 03:07:52,220
I don't talk much.

3437
03:07:52,220 --> 03:07:54,220
Wow, over there.

3438
03:07:54,220 --> 03:07:56,220
You're wearing it.

3439
03:08:01,220 --> 03:08:03,220
Say a word to your boyfriend.

3440
03:08:03,220 --> 03:08:04,220
What?

3441
03:08:04,220 --> 03:08:06,220
Say a word to your boyfriend.

3442
03:08:06,220 --> 03:08:08,220
I'm sorry.

3443
03:08:08,220 --> 03:08:09,220
You think so?

3444
03:08:09,220 --> 03:08:10,220
I think so.

3445
03:08:10,220 --> 03:08:11,220
You think so?

3446
03:08:11,220 --> 03:08:12,220
I think so.

3447
03:08:12,220 --> 03:08:14,220
What are you doing?

3448
03:08:16,220 --> 03:08:18,220
What are you doing?

3449
03:08:18,220 --> 03:08:19,220
I want it.

3450
03:08:19,220 --> 03:08:21,220
Next Jinpo?

3451
03:08:24,220 --> 03:08:26,220
Drink while you go.

3452
03:08:26,220 --> 03:08:28,220
I'm the strawberry princess.

3453
03:08:28,220 --> 03:08:29,220
You are so cute.

3454
03:08:43,220 --> 03:08:46,220
You drink here and talk here.

3455
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:48,220
Good, good.

3456
03:08:49,220 --> 03:08:51,220
Amazing.

3457
03:08:51,220 --> 03:08:52,220
It's amazing.

3458
03:08:52,220 --> 03:08:54,220
There's something in there too.

3459
03:09:03,220 --> 03:09:04,220
Amazing.

3460
03:09:11,220 --> 03:09:12,220
It's disgusting.

3461
03:09:14,220 --> 03:09:16,220
Oh, but it's still 1.

3462
03:09:17,220 --> 03:09:18,220
It's disgusting.

3463
03:09:18,220 --> 03:09:20,220
What is this?

3464
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:22,220
What is this?

3465
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:24,220
My legs...

3466
03:09:24,220 --> 03:09:26,220
My legs...

3467
03:09:38,220 --> 03:09:40,220
I'm scared.

3468
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:42,220
You're so good.

3469
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:50,720
Oh no, I'm the best today.

3470
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:52,720
I'm the best today.

3471
03:09:53,720 --> 03:09:55,720
I'm scared to scream.

3472
03:09:55,720 --> 03:09:57,720
I'm serious.

3473
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:05,720
It hurts.

3474
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:07,720
I'm scared.

3475
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:09,720
What is it?

3476
03:10:09,720 --> 03:10:11,720
I'm shivering.

3477
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:13,720
Shivering?

3478
03:10:13,720 --> 03:10:15,720
Is it reflected on the back?

3479
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:17,720
Yes, it is.

3480
03:10:19,720 --> 03:10:21,720
You're so cute.

3481
03:10:21,720 --> 03:10:23,720
You're so cute.

3482
03:10:23,720 --> 03:10:25,720
You're so cute.

3483
03:10:25,720 --> 03:10:27,720
I'm so scared.

3484
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:29,720
You're so cute.

3485
03:10:29,720 --> 03:10:31,720
I'm scared.

3486
03:10:31,720 --> 03:10:33,720
I can't feel it.

3487
03:10:33,720 --> 03:10:35,720
This way?

3488
03:10:37,720 --> 03:10:39,720
A little more.

3489
03:10:39,720 --> 03:10:41,720
I can't feel it.

3490
03:10:45,720 --> 03:10:47,720
This?

3491
03:10:47,720 --> 03:10:49,720
I can't feel it.

3492
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:53,720
I can't feel it.

3493
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:57,720
Yay!

3494
03:10:57,720 --> 03:10:59,720
Yay!

3495
03:10:59,720 --> 03:11:00,720
Yay!

3496
03:11:02,720 --> 03:11:04,720
Sutan is the most excited today.

3497
03:11:04,720 --> 03:11:05,720
Why?

3498
03:11:05,720 --> 03:11:06,720
She is excited.

3499
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:07,720
Look over there.

3500
03:11:08,720 --> 03:11:09,720
Amazing.

3501
03:11:09,720 --> 03:11:10,720
Amazing.

3502
03:11:10,720 --> 03:11:11,720
She is excited.

3503
03:11:20,720 --> 03:11:21,720
Be careful.

3504
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:23,720
Be careful.

3505
03:11:23,720 --> 03:11:25,720
Mom! Mom!

3506
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:31,720
You are so cute.

3507
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:33,720
Mom! Mom!

3508
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:42,720
Don't move your hands.

3509
03:11:43,720 --> 03:11:45,720
Don't move your hands.

3510
03:11:45,720 --> 03:11:47,720
It's dangerous.

3511
03:11:47,720 --> 03:11:49,720
Oh my god.

3512
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:57,720
They're coming.

3513
03:11:59,720 --> 03:12:01,720
They're coming.

3514
03:12:04,720 --> 03:12:06,720
Oh my god.

3515
03:12:06,720 --> 03:12:08,720
It hurts!

3516
03:12:14,720 --> 03:12:16,720
Oh, no.

3517
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:20,720
You were very energetic.

3518
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:22,720
What's wrong?

3519
03:12:22,720 --> 03:12:24,720
It's good.

3520
03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:26,720
Can I touch it?

3521
03:12:26,720 --> 03:12:28,720
Yes, you can.

3522
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:30,720
It's good.

3523
03:12:32,720 --> 03:12:34,720
It hurts!

3524
03:12:34,720 --> 03:12:36,720
It feels good.

3525
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:37,720
What?

3526
03:12:37,720 --> 03:12:38,720
It feels good.

3527
03:12:38,720 --> 03:12:40,720
It feels good.

3528
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:41,720
It feels good?

3529
03:12:47,720 --> 03:12:48,720
It feels good.

3530
03:12:52,720 --> 03:12:54,720
It feels better than the spicy one.

3531
03:12:54,720 --> 03:12:56,720
It feels better than the spicy one?

3532
03:12:56,720 --> 03:12:58,720
I'm getting called.

3533
03:12:58,720 --> 03:12:59,720
Let's go to the spicy one.

3534
03:12:59,720 --> 03:13:00,720
Who's the spicy one?

3535
03:13:00,720 --> 03:13:02,720
We're going to the spicy one today.

3536
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:04,720
Oh, no!

3537
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:09,720
Oh, no!

3538
03:13:16,720 --> 03:13:18,720
Oh, no!

3539
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:20,720
I'm being hugged.

3540
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:22,720
I'm being hugged.

3541
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:26,720
I thought I was going to fall.

3542
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:28,720
Did you hit me?

3543
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:34,720
Oh, no!

3544
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:38,720
Oh, no!

3545
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:40,720
Oh, no!

3546
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:44,720
I'll give it to you.

3547
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:48,720
It's so hot.

3548
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:50,720
It's normal.

3549
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:52,720
It's normal.

3550
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:54,720
It's a good feeling.

3551
03:13:59,720 --> 03:14:01,720
Oh, great.

3552
03:14:07,720 --> 03:14:09,720
Oh, my God!

3553
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:11,720
Oh, my God!

3554
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:13,720
Oh, my God!

3555
03:14:13,720 --> 03:14:15,720
Oh, my God!

3556
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:17,720
Oh, my God!

3557
03:14:17,720 --> 03:14:19,720
Oh, my God!

3558
03:14:19,720 --> 03:14:21,720
Oh, my God!

3559
03:14:21,720 --> 03:14:23,720
What do you think of this Chimpanzee?

3560
03:14:23,720 --> 03:14:25,720
I like all of them.

3561
03:14:25,720 --> 03:14:27,720
I think this Chimpanzee is more comfortable than the previous one.

3562
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:29,720
What?

3563
03:14:29,720 --> 03:14:31,720
I like it.

3564
03:14:33,720 --> 03:14:35,720
Hey, behind you!

3565
03:14:35,720 --> 03:14:37,720
Behind you!

3566
03:14:37,720 --> 03:14:39,720
Hey!

3567
03:14:41,720 --> 03:14:43,720
Isn't this crazy?

3568
03:14:43,720 --> 03:14:45,720
Let's get started.

3569
03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:54,720
This is crazy.

3570
03:14:54,720 --> 03:14:56,720
Are you happy?

3571
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:02,720
Haru, do you want to do it in the middle?

3572
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:04,720
Everyone do it in the middle.

3573
03:15:06,720 --> 03:15:08,720
Everyone do it in the middle.

3574
03:15:08,720 --> 03:15:11,720
Let's see how Sora-chan is doing.

3575
03:15:11,720 --> 03:15:12,720
How is it?

3576
03:15:12,720 --> 03:15:15,720
I want to eat Sora-chan's kiss.

3577
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:17,720
What?

3578
03:15:17,720 --> 03:15:19,720
I want to eat it.

3579
03:15:19,720 --> 03:15:20,720
I want to eat it.

3580
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:21,720
I want to eat it.

3581
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:23,720
Everyone, look at this.

3582
03:15:23,720 --> 03:15:25,720
Look at this.

3583
03:15:25,720 --> 03:15:27,720
I want to eat it.

3584
03:15:27,720 --> 03:15:29,720
Look at this.

3585
03:15:29,720 --> 03:15:31,720
Look at this.

3586
03:15:31,720 --> 03:15:33,720
I want to eat it.

3587
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:35,720
You like this.

3588
03:15:35,720 --> 03:15:37,720
What is this sweet potato?

3589
03:15:37,720 --> 03:15:39,720
I love you.

3590
03:15:39,720 --> 03:15:41,720
I love you too.

3591
03:15:41,720 --> 03:15:43,720
I love you too.

3592
03:15:43,720 --> 03:15:45,720
I want you.

3593
03:15:45,720 --> 03:15:47,720
Is it because you don't drink alcohol?

3594
03:15:47,720 --> 03:15:49,720
Is it because I love you?

3595
03:15:49,720 --> 03:15:51,720
If you look at my boyfriend like this, he will get angry.

3596
03:15:51,720 --> 03:15:53,720
He will get angry.

3597
03:15:53,720 --> 03:15:55,720
I'm going home.

3598
03:15:55,720 --> 03:15:57,720
It's painful.

3599
03:15:57,720 --> 03:16:02,720
They are all coming to me.

3600
03:16:02,720 --> 03:16:07,720
I'm going to call them.

3601
03:16:07,720 --> 03:16:12,720
I'm going to call them.

3602
03:16:12,720 --> 03:16:17,720
They are scared.

3603
03:16:17,720 --> 03:16:22,720
They are scared.

3604
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:24,720
Is this right?

3605
03:17:24,720 --> 03:17:26,720
Yes, yes.

3606
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:28,720
Is it ok?

3607
03:17:28,720 --> 03:17:30,720
It's sticking out.

3608
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:32,720
It's sticking out.

3609
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:34,720
Ok, ok.

3610
03:17:34,720 --> 03:17:36,720
Ah, it's that way again.

3611
03:17:36,720 --> 03:17:38,720
That way.

3612
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:40,720
I can't.

3613
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:42,720
If you drink alcohol, you'll be like this.

3614
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:48,720
It's almost done.

3615
03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:22,720
I want to be in the picture.

3616
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:25,720
Come on, come on, take a picture.

3617
03:18:25,720 --> 03:18:27,720
Come on, take a picture.

3618
03:18:27,720 --> 03:18:31,720
I want to be in the picture, too.

3619
03:18:31,720 --> 03:18:34,720
Come on, come on, take a picture.

3620
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:35,720
Good, good.

3621
03:18:35,720 --> 03:18:36,720
You are in the picture.

3622
03:18:36,720 --> 03:18:38,720
I'm in the picture.

3623
03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:39,720
I'm in the picture.

3624
03:18:39,720 --> 03:18:41,720
Peace, peace.

3625
03:18:41,720 --> 03:18:43,720
I'm sorry.

3626
03:18:47,720 --> 03:18:49,720
You love to be petted.

3627
03:18:49,720 --> 03:18:51,720
Do you have a boyfriend?

3628
03:18:51,720 --> 03:18:53,720
No.

3629
03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:55,720
I don't have a boyfriend.

3630
03:18:55,720 --> 03:18:57,720
I'm sorry.

3631
03:19:01,720 --> 03:19:03,720
You're good.

3632
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:05,720
You're hot.

3633
03:19:07,720 --> 03:19:09,720
I'm sorry.

3634
03:19:09,720 --> 03:19:11,720
I'm sorry.

3635
03:19:13,720 --> 03:19:15,720
I'm sorry.

3636
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:17,720
Someone drop the camera.

3637
03:19:17,720 --> 03:19:19,720
Where?

3638
03:19:19,720 --> 03:19:21,720
Someone drop it.

3639
03:19:21,720 --> 03:19:23,720
I'm sorry.

3640
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:25,720
I'm sorry.

3641
03:19:29,720 --> 03:19:31,720
I'm sorry.

3642
03:19:31,720 --> 03:19:33,720
I'm sorry.

3643
03:19:33,720 --> 03:19:35,720
I'm sorry.

3644
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:37,720
I'm sorry.

3645
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:40,720
I want to go to the bathroom.

3646
03:20:40,720 --> 03:20:42,720
I'm so happy!

3647
03:20:48,720 --> 03:20:50,720
I'm so happy!

3648
03:21:20,720 --> 03:21:22,720
This is Minari.

3649
03:21:22,720 --> 03:21:24,720
Minari-san.

3650
03:21:24,720 --> 03:21:26,720
What's wrong?

3651
03:21:26,720 --> 03:21:28,720
She's crying.

3652
03:21:28,720 --> 03:21:30,720
Are you okay?

3653
03:21:30,720 --> 03:21:32,720
It's dangerous.

3654
03:21:53,720 --> 03:21:55,720
It feels good.

3655
03:21:55,720 --> 03:21:57,720
So cute!

3656
03:21:57,720 --> 03:21:59,720
You are all so cute.

3657
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:01,720
So cute.

3658
03:22:01,720 --> 03:22:03,720
So cute.

3659
03:22:03,720 --> 03:22:05,720
No!

3660
03:22:05,720 --> 03:22:07,720
No!

3661
03:22:07,720 --> 03:22:09,720
No!

3662
03:22:09,720 --> 03:22:11,720
No!

3663
03:22:11,720 --> 03:22:13,720
No!

3664
03:22:13,720 --> 03:22:15,720
No!

3665
03:22:15,720 --> 03:22:17,720
I want to cry!

3666
03:22:17,720 --> 03:22:19,720
I want to cry!

3667
03:22:19,720 --> 03:22:21,720
I want to cry!

3668
03:22:21,720 --> 03:22:23,720
I want to cry!

3669
03:22:23,720 --> 03:22:25,720
I'm sorry.

3670
03:22:25,720 --> 03:22:27,720
I'm sorry.

3671
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:29,720
I'm sorry.

3672
03:22:29,720 --> 03:22:31,720
I'm sorry.

3673
03:22:31,720 --> 03:22:33,720
I'm sorry.

3674
03:22:35,720 --> 03:22:39,720
Everyone, please come here.

3675
03:22:39,720 --> 03:22:41,720
Yay!

3676
03:22:45,720 --> 03:22:47,720
Is there anyone?

3677
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:49,720
Everyone, please come here.

3678
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:51,720
Oh, it's cold.

3679
03:22:53,720 --> 03:22:56,720
Everyone, the training camp is the best!

3680
03:22:56,720 --> 03:22:58,720
The training camp is the best!

3681
03:22:58,720 --> 03:23:00,720
Is it the best?

3682
03:23:00,720 --> 03:23:01,720
It's the best!

3683
03:23:01,720 --> 03:23:03,720
Oh, that's good.

3684
03:23:05,720 --> 03:23:07,720
Oh, it's cold.

3685
03:23:10,720 --> 03:23:12,720
It's so cold.

3686
03:23:12,720 --> 03:23:14,720
Oh, it's cold.

3687
03:23:14,720 --> 03:23:17,720
Oh, it's cute.

3688
03:23:19,720 --> 03:23:22,720
Are you still teasing her here?

3689
03:23:23,720 --> 03:23:25,720
Oh, it's cute.

3690
03:23:40,720 --> 03:23:41,720
Hurry up!

3691
03:23:41,720 --> 03:23:42,720
Hold on.

3692
03:23:43,220 --> 03:23:44,720
Hold on.

3693
03:23:48,720 --> 03:23:50,720
I've seen Mala-chan and Misa-chan.

3694
03:23:50,720 --> 03:23:53,720
Yes, Mala-chan and Misa-chan.

3695
03:23:53,720 --> 03:23:54,720
So cute.

3696
03:23:54,720 --> 03:23:56,720
Bye bye.

3697
03:23:56,720 --> 03:23:58,720
I can't see.

3698
03:23:58,720 --> 03:23:59,720
I can see.

3699
03:24:00,720 --> 03:24:02,720
Can you see?

3700
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:05,720
Yes, I can.

3701
03:24:05,720 --> 03:24:07,720
No, you can't do that.

3702
03:24:07,720 --> 03:24:09,720
It's because it's a baby.

3703
03:24:09,720 --> 03:24:11,720
What is this?

3704
03:24:11,720 --> 03:24:13,720
What is this?

3705
03:24:13,720 --> 03:24:15,720
This is too much.

3706
03:24:15,720 --> 03:24:17,720
He's not coming out.

3707
03:24:17,720 --> 03:24:19,720
Oh, no.

3708
03:24:19,720 --> 03:24:21,720
He's coming out.

3709
03:24:21,720 --> 03:24:23,720
Oh, no.

3710
03:24:23,720 --> 03:24:25,720
Oh, no.

3711
03:24:25,720 --> 03:24:27,720
Oh, no.

3712
03:24:27,720 --> 03:24:29,720
Oh, no.

3713
03:24:29,720 --> 03:24:31,720
He's coming out.

3714
03:24:31,720 --> 03:24:33,720
Oh, no.

3715
03:24:33,720 --> 03:24:34,720
That's it.

3716
03:24:34,720 --> 03:24:35,720
What?

3717
03:24:35,720 --> 03:24:36,720
I'm going to put it in.

3718
03:24:36,720 --> 03:24:38,720
You're going to put it in.

3719
03:24:38,720 --> 03:24:39,720
What's going on?

3720
03:24:40,720 --> 03:24:41,720
Hey, hey.

3721
03:24:41,720 --> 03:24:42,720
You're going to put it in.

3722
03:24:42,720 --> 03:24:43,720
You're going to put it in.

3723
03:24:43,720 --> 03:24:44,720
You're going to put it in.

3724
03:24:44,720 --> 03:24:45,720
Nama is the best.

3725
03:24:46,720 --> 03:24:47,720
Like this?

3726
03:24:47,720 --> 03:24:48,720
Yes.

3727
03:24:48,720 --> 03:24:49,720
Ah!

3728
03:24:49,720 --> 03:24:50,720
Ah!

3729
03:24:50,720 --> 03:24:51,720
Ah!

3730
03:24:51,720 --> 03:24:52,720
Ah!

3731
03:24:52,720 --> 03:24:53,720
Ah!

3732
03:24:53,720 --> 03:24:54,720
Ah!

3733
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:55,720
Ah!

3734
03:24:55,720 --> 03:24:56,720
Ah!

3735
03:24:56,720 --> 03:24:57,720
Ah!

3736
03:24:57,720 --> 03:24:58,720
Ah!

3737
03:24:58,720 --> 03:24:59,720
Ah!

3738
03:24:59,720 --> 03:25:00,720
Ah!

3739
03:25:00,720 --> 03:25:01,720
Ah!

3740
03:25:01,720 --> 03:25:02,720
Ah!

3741
03:25:32,720 --> 03:25:34,720
He's so kind!

3742
03:25:34,720 --> 03:25:36,720
He's so kind, too!

3743
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:38,720
It's ok.

3744
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:40,720
It's ok.

3745
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:42,720
He's so kind, too.

3746
03:25:42,720 --> 03:25:44,720
It's ok.

3747
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:46,720
It feels good to do it live.

3748
03:25:46,720 --> 03:25:48,720
It's ok?

3749
03:25:48,720 --> 03:25:50,720
It's ok.

3750
03:25:50,720 --> 03:25:52,720
It's ok?

3751
03:25:52,720 --> 03:25:54,720
It's ok?

3752
03:25:54,720 --> 03:25:56,720
It's ok?

3753
03:25:56,720 --> 03:25:58,720
Oh, it hurts!

3754
03:25:58,720 --> 03:26:00,720
Oh!

3755
03:26:00,720 --> 03:26:02,720
Oh, it came out.

3756
03:26:02,720 --> 03:26:04,720
Oh, no.

3757
03:26:04,720 --> 03:26:06,720
Show me.

3758
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:08,720
Oh, no.

3759
03:26:08,720 --> 03:26:10,720
Oh, no.

3760
03:26:10,720 --> 03:26:12,720
Oh, no.

3761
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:14,720
Oh, no.

3762
03:26:14,720 --> 03:26:16,720
Oh, no.

3763
03:26:16,720 --> 03:26:18,720
Oh, no.

3764
03:26:18,720 --> 03:26:20,720
It came out a lot.

3765
03:26:20,720 --> 03:26:22,720
It's really coming out.

3766
03:26:22,720 --> 03:26:24,720
Oh, no.

3767
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:26,720
Oh, no.

3768
03:26:26,720 --> 03:26:28,720
Oh, no.

3769
03:26:28,720 --> 03:26:30,720
Noisy

3770
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:32,720
It's good

3771
03:26:32,720 --> 03:26:34,720
Wait

3772
03:26:34,720 --> 03:26:36,720
The princess

3773
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:38,720
The princess is also noisier

3774
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:40,720
Noisy

3775
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:42,720
Where

3776
03:26:42,720 --> 03:26:44,720
So noisier

3777
03:26:44,720 --> 03:26:46,720
So noisier

3778
03:26:46,720 --> 03:26:48,720
More

3779
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:50,720
Wine

3780
03:26:50,720 --> 03:26:52,720
Noisy

3781
03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:54,720
Noisy

3782
03:26:54,720 --> 03:26:56,720
Noisy

3783
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:58,720
You are in a mess!

3784
03:26:58,720 --> 03:27:00,720
Are you going to get into the mess?

3785
03:27:00,720 --> 03:27:02,720
Are you going to get in?

3786
03:27:02,720 --> 03:27:04,720
Are you going to get in?

3787
03:27:04,720 --> 03:27:07,720
Are you going to be in a mess?

3788
03:27:07,720 --> 03:27:09,720
Are you going to be in a mess?

3789
03:27:10,720 --> 03:27:11,720
What?

3790
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:12,720
Are you going to get in?

3791
03:27:12,720 --> 03:27:13,720
Are you going to be in a mess?

3792
03:27:13,720 --> 03:27:16,720
Do you want more?

3793
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:21,720
It's fun to take pictures, but what is this?

3794
03:27:22,720 --> 03:27:23,720
Who is taking pictures?

3795
03:27:23,720 --> 03:27:24,720
It's me.

3796
03:27:24,720 --> 03:27:26,720
How do you feel?

3797
03:27:26,720 --> 03:27:28,720
Do you want to have a drink with me?

3798
03:27:34,720 --> 03:27:36,720
You feel good, don't you?

3799
03:27:36,720 --> 03:27:38,720
Hime-chan's voice is amazing.

3800
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:40,720
I'm scared!

3801
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:48,720
I'm scared!

3802
03:27:49,720 --> 03:27:51,720
Are you okay?

3803
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:53,720
Are you okay?

3804
03:27:55,720 --> 03:27:56,720
I'm scared too.

3805
03:27:56,720 --> 03:27:57,720
Are you okay?

3806
03:27:57,720 --> 03:27:58,720
Are you okay?

3807
03:27:58,720 --> 03:27:59,720
Are you okay?

3808
03:27:59,720 --> 03:28:00,720
Are you going to take it out?

3809
03:28:10,720 --> 03:28:11,720
It's gone.

3810
03:28:13,720 --> 03:28:14,720
I took it out.

3811
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:15,720
I took it out.

3812
03:28:15,720 --> 03:28:16,720
Do you think it will come out?

3813
03:28:16,720 --> 03:28:17,720
Really?

3814
03:29:17,720 --> 03:29:19,720
The last one!

3815
03:29:19,720 --> 03:29:21,720
It's delicious.

3816
03:29:21,720 --> 03:29:23,720
Is it delicious?

3817
03:29:23,720 --> 03:29:25,720
It's delicious.

3818
03:29:25,720 --> 03:29:27,720
Huh?

3819
03:29:27,720 --> 03:29:29,720
The last one!

3820
03:29:29,720 --> 03:29:31,720
What about Sora?

3821
03:29:31,720 --> 03:29:33,720
She's doing a double-up.

3822
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:35,720
What about Sora?

3823
03:29:35,720 --> 03:29:37,720
Sora is going for the fourth one.

3824
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:39,720
Do you think I'm doing a double-up?

3825
03:29:39,720 --> 03:29:41,720
I think so.

3826
03:29:41,720 --> 03:29:43,720
It's obvious.

3827
03:29:43,720 --> 03:29:45,720
It's obvious.

3828
03:29:45,720 --> 03:29:49,360
Let's get it on!

3829
03:29:49,360 --> 03:29:50,360
Okay.

3830
03:29:50,360 --> 03:29:51,360
What's up!

3831
03:29:51,360 --> 03:29:52,360
What's up!

3832
03:29:52,360 --> 03:29:53,360
I'm so sorry!

3833
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:54,360
I'm so sorry!

3834
03:29:54,360 --> 03:29:55,360
I'm so sorry!

3835
03:29:55,360 --> 03:29:56,360
I'm so sorry!

3836
03:29:56,360 --> 03:29:57,360
I'm so sorry!

3837
03:29:57,360 --> 03:29:58,360
I'm so sorry!

3838
03:29:58,360 --> 03:29:59,360
I'm so sorry!

3839
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:00,360
I'm so sorry!

3840
03:30:00,360 --> 03:30:03,360
I think Sora is about to die.

3841
03:30:03,360 --> 03:30:05,320
Let's do a Sora call.

3842
03:30:05,320 --> 03:30:07,320
It's Sora!

3843
03:30:07,320 --> 03:30:10,320
Sora!

3844
03:30:10,320 --> 03:30:12,320
Sora!

3845
03:30:12,320 --> 03:30:14,320
It's Sora!

3846
03:30:14,320 --> 03:30:18,320
Sola! Sola!

3847
03:30:18,320 --> 03:30:20,320
Sola!

3848
03:30:20,320 --> 03:30:22,320
It's good, isn't it?

3849
03:30:22,320 --> 03:30:24,320
It's good, isn't it?

3850
03:30:24,320 --> 03:30:26,320
It's good, isn't it?

3851
03:30:26,320 --> 03:30:28,320
It's amazing.

3852
03:30:28,320 --> 03:30:30,320
How is it, Yoko?

3853
03:30:30,320 --> 03:30:32,320
I can't do it.

3854
03:30:32,320 --> 03:30:34,320
Yoko, this is bad.

3855
03:30:34,320 --> 03:30:36,320
Be careful.

3856
03:30:36,320 --> 03:30:38,320
Oh, my God!

3857
03:30:45,320 --> 03:30:47,320
It's coming out!

3858
03:30:48,320 --> 03:30:50,320
You have to hold it tight!

3859
03:30:50,320 --> 03:30:52,320
Hold it tight!

3860
03:30:52,320 --> 03:30:54,320
Is it coming out?

3861
03:30:54,320 --> 03:30:56,320
Oh, my God! It's coming out!

3862
03:30:56,320 --> 03:30:58,320
It's warm!

3863
03:30:58,320 --> 03:31:00,320
Oh, my God!

3864
03:31:01,320 --> 03:31:03,320
I think you can eat a little more.

3865
03:31:03,320 --> 03:31:05,320
Ah!

3866
03:31:05,320 --> 03:31:07,320
Ah!

3867
03:31:07,320 --> 03:31:09,320
You're the fourth one.

3868
03:31:09,320 --> 03:31:11,320
Nakanishi! The first one!

3869
03:31:11,320 --> 03:31:13,320
The second one!

3870
03:31:13,320 --> 03:31:15,320
The third one!

3871
03:31:15,320 --> 03:31:17,320
The fourth one!

3872
03:31:17,320 --> 03:31:19,320
Yay!

3873
03:31:19,320 --> 03:31:21,320
Isn't it bright?

3874
03:31:21,320 --> 03:31:23,320
Let's eat!

3875
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:25,320
Yay!

3876
03:31:25,320 --> 03:31:27,320
Yay!

3877
03:31:27,320 --> 03:31:29,320
It's bright!

3878
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:31,320
Yay!

3879
03:31:31,320 --> 03:31:35,320
Nakatoshi, you're the best!

3880
03:31:45,320 --> 03:31:48,320
Nakatoshi, you're the best!

3881
03:31:48,320 --> 03:31:49,320
Oh, oh, oh.

3882
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:52,320
Wow, that was nice.

3883
03:31:52,320 --> 03:31:54,320
That was so much fun.

3884
03:31:54,320 --> 03:31:55,320
Yay!

3885
03:31:55,320 --> 03:31:56,320
Yay!

3886
03:31:56,320 --> 03:31:57,320
That was fun.

3887
03:32:03,320 --> 03:32:04,320
What? Really?

3888
03:32:04,320 --> 03:32:05,320
Yeah.

3889
03:32:05,320 --> 03:32:06,320
I didn't know that.

3890
03:32:08,320 --> 03:32:09,320
Hey, hey, hey.

3891
03:32:09,320 --> 03:32:11,320
Don't be silly, really.

3892
03:32:11,320 --> 03:32:12,320
Seriously?

3893
03:32:12,320 --> 03:32:14,320
They're really angry.

3894
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:20,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

3895
03:32:20,320 --> 03:32:21,320
Seriously?

3896
03:32:21,320 --> 03:32:22,320
Seriously?

3897
03:32:22,320 --> 03:32:23,320
Hold on.

3898
03:32:23,320 --> 03:32:24,320
You're kidding.

3899
03:32:24,320 --> 03:32:25,320
You're being called out.

3900
03:32:25,320 --> 03:32:26,320
Seriously?

3901
03:32:26,320 --> 03:32:27,320
You're being called out.

3902
03:32:27,320 --> 03:32:28,320
Wow.

3903
03:32:28,320 --> 03:32:29,320
Wow.

3904
03:32:29,320 --> 03:32:32,320
Don't be silly, okay?

3905
03:32:35,320 --> 03:32:37,320
Say a word to your boyfriend.

3906
03:32:37,320 --> 03:32:38,320
Say a word.

3907
03:32:38,320 --> 03:32:39,320
A word?

3908
03:32:39,320 --> 03:32:40,320
Yes.

3909
03:32:40,320 --> 03:32:42,320
No, I don't have anything.

3910
03:32:42,320 --> 03:32:43,320
What do you mean?

3911
03:32:43,320 --> 03:32:45,320
Are you saying that you don't have anything?

3912
03:32:45,320 --> 03:32:46,320
No, I don't have anything.

3913
03:32:46,320 --> 03:32:50,320
I've been having sex lately, so I'm self-sufficient.

3914
03:32:50,320 --> 03:32:51,320
I'm self-sufficient.

3915
03:32:51,320 --> 03:32:53,320
Oh, that's scary.

3916
03:32:53,320 --> 03:32:54,320
Well...

3917
03:32:54,320 --> 03:32:57,320
What is it? What is it? What is it?

3918
03:32:57,320 --> 03:32:58,320
What is it?

3919
03:32:58,320 --> 03:32:59,320
What is it?

3920
03:32:59,320 --> 03:33:01,320
What is it?

3921
03:33:01,320 --> 03:33:02,320
What is it?

3922
03:33:02,320 --> 03:33:04,320
I really want you to be this cute.

3923
03:33:04,320 --> 03:33:06,320
What? You suddenly...

3924
03:33:06,320 --> 03:33:08,320
You were so cute earlier.

3925
03:33:08,320 --> 03:33:10,320
Are you back to the morning mood?

3926
03:33:10,320 --> 03:33:11,320
Wait!

3927
03:33:11,320 --> 03:33:12,320
What?

3928
03:33:13,320 --> 03:33:18,320
Actually, I love Pippi, but...

3929
03:33:18,320 --> 03:33:20,320
But you were really scared of Chimpo earlier.

3930
03:33:20,320 --> 03:33:22,320
I want to be with Chimpo!

3931
03:33:22,320 --> 03:33:24,320
Say it to your boyfriend again.

3932
03:33:24,320 --> 03:33:28,320
Please take care of Chimpo.

3933
03:33:29,320 --> 03:33:32,320
I'm not talking to my boyfriend today, so I don't think it's a good idea not to talk to him.

3934
03:33:32,320 --> 03:33:33,320
Is that okay?

3935
03:33:33,320 --> 03:33:35,320
But say something to your boyfriend.

3936
03:33:35,320 --> 03:33:36,320
Say something to my boyfriend?

3937
03:33:36,320 --> 03:33:38,320
If you were watching this...

3938
03:33:38,320 --> 03:33:41,320
Sorry, I felt good today.

3939
03:33:44,320 --> 03:33:47,320
This is good for the blood circulation.

3940
03:33:47,320 --> 03:33:50,320
It's not gonna happen.

3941
03:33:50,320 --> 03:33:53,320
It's gonna happen.

3942
03:33:53,320 --> 03:33:59,320
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

3943
03:33:59,320 --> 03:34:01,320
Wow!

3944
03:34:01,320 --> 03:34:03,320
Wow!

3945
03:34:03,320 --> 03:34:05,320
I can't believe it!

3946
03:34:07,320 --> 03:34:09,320
Do you want to have a toast?

3947
03:34:09,320 --> 03:34:11,320
Let's have a toast.

3948
03:34:11,320 --> 03:34:13,320
Let's drink.

3949
03:34:13,320 --> 03:34:15,320
You're kidding!

3950
