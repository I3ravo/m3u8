1
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:14,500
Tanaka, come here.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,980
Thank you.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Please sit down.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
Excuse me.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Excuse me.

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,700
Thank you.

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,660
Thank you.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,260
Let's eat.

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,340
Tanaka.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Yes.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
You know, right?

12
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,750
Chief, even if you say you
know, I can't hide it anymore.

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,270
Why? If you do something,
the company won't find out.

14
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:26,210
Even if you say so, I already
have more than 20 million yen.

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,490
Tanaka.

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,350
Yes.

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,670
Who are you
talking to? I'm sorry.

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,550


19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,030
I'm the one who made you a manager
and made you successful, right?

20
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:46,510
That's right, but it's difficult.

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,690
Listen up.

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,810
This time,

23
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,050
I need 5 million yen
for my cute young wife.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,350
I'm counting on you until tomorrow.

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,070
Until tomorrow?

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,010
I'm not going to take it.

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,180
I'm counting on you.

28
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,610
That's not what I meant.

29
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,970
It's the company's money.

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Even if you say that,

31
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,040
the money is mine.

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,460
I understand.

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,461
Please let this be the last time.

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,060
The last time?

35
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,780
If you give me the same amount
of money every month, I'll quit.

36
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,660
Money is.

37
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,340
..

38
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,540
impossible.

39
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,920
Or...

40
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,600
Can I make you satisfied with this?

41
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,860
What?

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,500
What are you talking
about? Tanaka-san.

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,060


44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Yes? What I like is.

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,720
..

46
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,721
Yes? Money.

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280


48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
And... Don't forget.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,440
I'm the wife of the chief,

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
who has a great power.

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,860
That's it.

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,140
Hey, Momo.

54
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,410
I'm back.

55
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,940
Are you okay, chief? I'm fine.

56
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,900


57
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,100
Get me out of here.

58
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Hey!

59
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,240
Oh, you're back early.

60
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,640
Chief, I've been drinking all day.

61
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
I'm drunk.

62
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
I'm not drunk.

63
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
I'm the chief.

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,660
You bring the money, so I
don't have to do anything.

65
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,340
What are you talking about?

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm going to bed.

67
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,800
Bring me some water.

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,280
Wake me up when you're done.

69
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,260
Yes, Tanaka.

70
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,550
Hey, Tanaka.

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Yes?

72
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,050
Where's the money?

73
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,490
What? I'm sorry.

74
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,640
I'm not ready yet.

75
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,060
Hurry up and bring it.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Hurry up.

78
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Yes.

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Tomorrow,

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,880
That person is not in Baroque,

81
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,140
Be sure to bring it.

82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Then go home early.

83
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,810
Sato.

84
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,170
What's up?

85
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
I can't do it anymore.

86
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,930
What? I'm fired.

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,670


88
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,610
What do you mean?

89
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,930
What do you mean?

90
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Do you know?

91
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,010
It's about the manager's pay.

92
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,030
Oh, that.

93
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,690
Yeah.

94
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,890
I can't do it anymore.

95
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,570
So, how much is it
this time? 5 million yen.

96
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,570


97
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,610
5 million yen? Yeah.

98
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,810


99
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,410
And my wife asked me to do it.

100
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,170
I can't help it anymore.

101
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,340
So you're giving up on it?

102
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Clean-out? That's right.

103
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,160
I've prepared so much.

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I can't do it anymore.

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,680
I have no choice but to be hungry.

106
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,120
Are you sure you don't need a manager?

107
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
It can't be helped.

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
I was promoted thanks to the manager.

109
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,520
I can't do it anymore.

110
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Hey, Tanaka.

111
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,720
I have a good idea.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
What's the matter? It's this.

113
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,350


114
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,810
What's this?

115
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,230
I'm going to make my wife drink this.

116
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,610
What's this powder? Is it okay?

117
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,570
It's a beauty serum.

118
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,070
Beauty serum?

119
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,070
What's beauty serum?

120
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,350
If you drink this, you'll feel better.

121
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,610
Are you sure it's okay?

122
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,990
If you drink this, you'll get erotic.

123
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,090
Are you sure it's
okay? It's okay.

124
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,510


125
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,250
It's a little erotic.

126
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,910
It's no problem compared to Oryo.

127
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,850
Is that so?

128
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,140
I'll make you drink this and pay you back.

129
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,400
Are you sure it's okay?

130
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,540
I'll find a way to make you drink it.

131
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
Oh.

132
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,430
When the day comes to
get married, I'll go with you.

133
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,250
Please contact me.

134
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,650
I got it.

135
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,350
I believe in you.

136
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,890
Yeah.

137
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,010
Thank you.

138
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,430
I'll leave it to you.

139
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,870
Yeah.

140
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
That's right.

141
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,080
I'll leave it to you.

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Yeah.

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Yes.

144
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Excuse me.

145
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,500
Excuse me.

146
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,720
It's hot.

147
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,760
You're late.

148
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,660
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,180
Please give it to me quickly.

150
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,980
Please wait a minute.

151
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,040
It was very hot today.

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,680
Please give me a cup of tea.

153
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,030
Is this okay?

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,930
How is it?

155
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
Please give it to me quickly.

156
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,730
Well, well, well.

157
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,810
Don't be in such a hurry.

158
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
I've got it ready.

159
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh,

160
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,440
I don't have the 5 million
yen envelope I prepared.

161
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
What? Oh, right.

162
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,650


163
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,100
I put it in the post just now.

164
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,800
Why did you put it in the post?

165
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Can you take a look at it?

166
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Hey.

167
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:50,470 --> 00:12:25,220
I didn't see it in the post.

169
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,280
I'm sorry, Miss.

170
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,281
It was in the bag.

171
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,440
What are you doing?

173
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,460
Is this okay?

174
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
By the way,

175
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,100
this tea tastes really weird.

176
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,580
What?

177
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,740
It's really bad.

178
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,680
What are you talking about?

179
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:05,730
It's delicious, isn't it?

180
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,670
What are you talking about?

181
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,070
Is it delicious?

182
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,030
A little more?

183
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,150
What is the effect?

184
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,630
Mrs.

185
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,330
Mrs.

186
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,930
Are you okay?

187
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,280
Hey, what is this?

188
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,240
It's a nice view, isn't it?

189
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,560
Hey, what is this?

190
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,250
You did a good job.

191
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,460
Oh, Sato.

192
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,360
Hey, what are you guys
doing? Hey, let me go.

193
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,980


194
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,560
I'm your husband.

195
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,030
I work with Tanaka.

196
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:36,220
Do you think you can
get away with this? I know.

197
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:39,100


198
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm going to arrest the
wife of the worst manager.

199
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
I'm going to do it now.

200
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:53,510
Don't make noise.

201
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,431
Don't touch me.
If you do this, you'll be fired.

202
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,410
I'm already fired.

203
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,390
By your worst husband.

204
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,550
But if I have this
video, you'll be targeted.

205
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,990
From other employees.

206
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,520
Don't touch me.

207
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,800
Nanaka, I'll talk to your chest.

208
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,340
Hey, Sato.

209
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Stop it.

210
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,560
Don't touch me.

211
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,440
Hey, stop it.

212
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,750
Stop it.

213
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,530
Hey, stop it.

214
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,890
What's wrong with
you? Hey, stop it.

215
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,810


216
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,710
Are you drunk? No, I'm not.

217
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,830


218
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,250
What?

219
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,150
Hey.

220
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,330
Honey, it's medicine.

221
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,150
What?

222
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:00,850
It's medicine for you.

223
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:01,851
What? Stop it.

224
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,650


225
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,990
You don't look well.

226
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,420
Stop it.

227
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,600
I made you drink it
because you didn't feel well.

228
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,300
Stop it.

229
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:23,940
Do you want me to stop?

230
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,440
You don't look like you don't like it.

231
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,460
No, I don't want to stop.

232
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,610
You don't look like you don't like it.
What's that voice?

233
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,540
Are you listening
to me? No, I'm not.

234
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,900
Don't touch me.

235
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,300


236
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,240
Let's see how much you're listening to me.

237
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,180
Stop it.

238
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,980
Stop it.

239
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,560
Don't touch me any more.

240
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,600
I can't leave you alone.

241
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,960
Stop it.

242
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:41,980
Please calm down.
I'll make you feel better.

243
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,060
Please stop.

244
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,370
You're wearing such a dirty thing.

245
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,520
Please stop.

246
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:08,320
Is this the reaction of a person
who really wants to quit? I can't do it.

247
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,300


248
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:27,400
Do you really want to quit?

249
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
I don't want to.

250
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,740
You're reacting a lot.

251
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,300
This is proof that it's working.

252
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
I feel weird.

253
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,340
I can't do it.

254
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,341
What's going on?

255
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,540
You're feeling better
because of the medicine.

256
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
No, I'm not.

257
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,840
I'll give you a lot of medicine.

258
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Is this better?

259
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:20,640
If you feel so good,
What's wrong with you?

260
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:21,641
What's going on here?

261
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,040
Why can't I touch you?

262
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Are you in a bad mood?

263
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,760
Your clothes are very wet.

264
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
Why?

265
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,060
Don't you hate it?

266
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,100
What's wrong with
you? You are so wet.

267
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,101


268
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,100
Can you hear this sound?

269
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,990
You are more nervous than before.

270
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,470
I'm sorry.

271
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,560
What's the matter with you?

273
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,830
You look a little sick.

274
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:32,130
Did you get sick?

275
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,140
You've never felt so good.

276
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:44,960
I've never seen a cat like this before.

277
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,820
I told you, didn't I?

278
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:28,820
Do you wear such an
erotic costume every day?

279
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,821
What are you doing?

280
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,100
I'm just touching your butt.

281
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,240
Why are you moving your body like that?

282
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,930
I don't feel good just by doing this.

283
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,270
Do you want me to lick you again?

284
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Good morning, Su-yong.

285
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:20,415
You seem to be in a good mood.

286
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
What's wrong with you?

287
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
You don't resist at all.

288
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,460
You don't have enough strength.

289
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,070
You are going crazy.

290
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,280
Oh, you got loose.

291
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,780
You can run away.

292
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,400
You got loose.

293
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,860
You don't want to run away?

294
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,100
You don't want to run away?

295
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Do you want to continue?

296
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,100
What's wrong with you?

297
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,210
Do you want this? Come closer.

298
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,200


299
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,190
What's wrong?

300
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,010
Do you want this?

301
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,611
Aoi's owner says, Aoi has
a problem with her stomach,

302
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,930
and that's why she's
having a hard time eating.

303
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,430
I'm going to give her a medicine,

304
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,230
but I'm going to take care of
her, and I'm going to feed her.

305
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,990
I never thought I'd be able to do this.

306
00:29:58,991 --> 00:29:59,991
Pfft.

307
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,810
Urgh.

308
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,830
You look more delicious.

309
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,390
Pfft.

310
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,950
Urgh.

311
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,270
Urgh.

312
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,190
Urgh.

313
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,510
Pfft.

314
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,280
Ah, ah.

315
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,630
Urgh.

316
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,010
Urgh.

317
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:50,880
Urgh.

318
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:51,881
Pfft.

319
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,060
Urgh.

320
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,780
You look so hungry.

321
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,080
Do you want to eat only your mouth?

322
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,440
You don't want to eat, do you?

323
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,410
Where do you want to eat?

324
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,020
It's good, isn't it?

325
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,890
It looks like it's going to go in a lot.

326
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,090
I want you to put it in.

327
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,510
I'm going to enter the cat room.

328
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,150
I'm going to enter the cat room.

329
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,080
Are you okay?

330
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,500
Are you okay?

331
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:02,080
You are not okay, aren't you?

332
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,160
You are doing something bad.

333
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:07,500
You are getting fatter
and fatter, aren't you?

334
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,580
I'll leave this video for you.

335
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,260
You are getting fatter
and fatter, aren't you?

336
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,720
Please feel it more.

337
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,181
You are getting fatter
and fatter, aren't you?

338
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,050
She is about to cry.

339
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,670
I think it's getting more
and more effective.

340
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,360
What are you going to do?

341
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,620
You don't know how you feel, do you?

342
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,840
You've gone completely crazy.

343
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,841
What's wrong with you?

344
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,900
Where did your first foot go?

345
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,060
Look, it's swollen.

346
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,820
You're doing such a terrible thing.

347
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,730
My son's going to sleep a little longer.

348
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,170
He's moving his body.

349
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,560
He's moving his body again.

350
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,201
You want to sleep comfortably, don't you?

351
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,140
This video is a video of
a baby who Just woke up.

352
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,550
I made a video of the
baby's bedding andarent.

353
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:36,640
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

354
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm glad I was able to see it.

355
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,681
I'm glad I was able to see it.

356
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,461
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and I've

357
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:23,230
never seen a cat like this
before, so I'm a little worried.

358
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,570
I'm worried about the cat's health.

359
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,850
Oh, it's so hot today.

360
00:41:53,710 --> 00:43:05,820
What have you been
doing? It's so funny.

361
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:44,101
I am going to sleep.

362
00:43:53,350 --> 00:44:00,430
Please forgive me.

363
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,920
Riki, I came here to see you.

364
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,180
Where do you want to sleep?

365
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,220
Do you want this?

366
00:44:52,330 --> 00:45:03,170
Do you want to go to school?

367
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,330
I want to live a normal life.

368
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:55,850
I don't want to go to school.

369
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:54,750
I don't want to go to school.

370
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,880
You are a good actress.

371
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,020
Sato, you did a good job.

372
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:23,880
It's hot.

373
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,930
It's hot, isn't it?

374
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,710
This is the best.

375
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,820
I can't hold this.

376
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Hayako.

377
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,360
What?

378
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,120
Hayako, come here.

379
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,671
I don't want to. I'm tired.

380
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,620
Hayako.

381
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,660
I brought a pencil case.

382
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:58,780
I brought it for you.

383
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,640
Is it good? Yes, it is.

384
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,640


385
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,740
Make yourself comfortable.

386
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,970
It's good.

387
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,190
Lick it.

388
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:27,191
There's a lot left.

389
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,530
It's soft.

390
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,790
It's good.

391
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,791
Can I touch your stomach?

392
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,570
My stomach hurts.

393
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,870
Does it hurt? I'm tired.

394
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,530


395
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,950
My stomach hurts.

396
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,750
Does it hurt?

397
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,050
Put your hand in.

398
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,690
It's comfortable, isn't it?

399
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,031
Now you can put your hand in.

400
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,350
It's uncomfortable.

401
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,330
It's comfortable, isn't it?

402
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,760
I'm done!

403
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,660
Are you OK?

404
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,380
I'll give you more.

405
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,650
There you go.

406
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,650
How do you feel?

407
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,150
Can you break
an egg? Yes, I can.

408
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:10,590


409
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
Ugh...

410
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Ah...

411
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:07,650
Ummm...

412
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,010
I want to sleep...

413
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:19,310
I want to fall asleep...
I want to sleep...

414
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,690
Ahhh...

415
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,730
Oh, that feeling...

416
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:38,770
You are very good at it.

417
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,730
Look this way.

418
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,230
You have a good smile.

419
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,440
The day before yesterday,
I had a hard time with him.

420
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,270
So I'm going to take a break from his hair.

421
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,880
At first, I thought that it would
be hard to get used to the hair.

422
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,160
But I was able to get used to it.

423
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,760
This?

424
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,240
It's good!

425
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,110
Do you know it's getting hard?

426
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,480
It's getting hard.

427
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,100
I want to eat it quickly.

428
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,400
You will be sucked in soon.

429
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,660
Oh, you are very ticklish.

430
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,790
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

431
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,970
I'm sorry.

432
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,130
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

433
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,330
I'm so sorry.

434
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:05,590
Today, I will show you
how to make Tuna Katsu.

435
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:42,400
Tuna Katsu is a food made with
tuna, which is a low-carb food.

436
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:44,521
I will cut it in half with
a knife and cut it into 4.

437
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,280
Oh, it's hot.

438
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:58,580
Oh, it's hot.

439
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Oh, it's hot.

440
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,040
Chinchin is getting hard.

441
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,200
Oh, it's dirty.

442
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,500
I'm sorry.

443
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,980
I'm sorry.

444
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,640
I want to go to bed.

445
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,580
You are talking with a surprised face.

446
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,200
Let's sleep.

447
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:48,000
The stomach is getting bigger.

448
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:04,320
That's great.

449
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:57,660
This is the first time I've ever seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

450
00:57:57,661 --> 00:57:57,700
It's been a long time since I've seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

451
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:58,140
It's been a long time since I've seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

452
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,276
It's been a long time since I've seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

453
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,550
It's been a long time since I've seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

454
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:49,560
I'm sleepy.

455
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:50,920
I'm sleepy.

456
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,360
Do you like the pillow?

457
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,980
I like the pillow.

458
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,280
Do you like the pillow?

459
00:58:58,281 --> 00:58:58,500
I want to sleep more.

460
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,880
I want to sleep more.

461
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,260
Keep doing it.

462
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,820
My stomach is growling.

463
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,240
It's very hard.

464
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,980
Touch the ball.

465
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:43,550
The ball?

466
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
Yes.

467
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,420
Harder.

468
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,480
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

469
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,000


470
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:26,790
I hope you get a lot of hair.

471
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,450
I think I can get a lot of hair.

472
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:31,710
Really?

473
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,030
Can I? Yes, you can.

474
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,850


475
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,350
I can get a lot of hair.

476
01:00:54,065 --> 01:00:55,970
It's so hot.

477
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,470
I'm sweating a lot.

478
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,490
I'm sweating a lot.

479
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,091
I think you'll forget how you look
when you get a hair transplant.

480
01:01:14,185 --> 01:01:15,266
I'm going to take a shower.

481
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,780
I came here as I promised.

482
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,960
Please delete that video.

483
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,260
It's not that easy.

484
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,320
That video is a gift from Tanaka.

485
01:02:33,665 --> 01:02:35,780
Tanaka did a good job.

486
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:39,930
But I feel sorry for him.

487
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,420
I was hanged and fired
by the head of the club.

488
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,170
We will avenge you by
following Mr. Tanaka's will.

489
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,860
Then you should blame him.

490
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:11,611
I have nothing to do with it.

491
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,730
You have.

492
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,100
You are the wife of the head of the club.

493
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:18,381
I think you have a lot of money.

494
01:03:29,395 --> 01:03:31,140
I hate that kind of person, too.

495
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,280
I just want to be with him for money.

496
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
You have a good mind.

497
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,980
Then, let's get excited about
things that you don't like.

498
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:44,421
Let's get excited with such a thing.

499
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,470
Please drink it today.

500
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,250
Don't you want it?

501
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,530
You drank it yesterday,
didn't you? Drink it.

502
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:17,970


503
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,510
You want to fly, don't you?

504
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,111
You've been waiting for
a long time, haven't you?

505
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,640
Ochi-san

506
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,081
Let's wait until he comes to you.

507
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,370
Yes

508
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,610
Ochi-san

509
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,681
You've been on a little trip.

510
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,450
It's about time you let go of your eyes.

511
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:43,820
Yes

512
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:45,630
You are amazing.

513
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,870
By the way, this is very effective.

514
01:06:00,815 --> 01:06:09,920
What do you want?

515
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,720
What will happen if the chief sees this?

516
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:26,740
Do you want so
much? I'm so sleepy.

517
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:28,900


518
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,540
You're so sleepy.

519
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,540
You can't concentrate.

520
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:35,900
I want to do it right now.

521
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,700
Please.

522
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,420
How about this? I'm so sleepy.

523
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,720


524
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,060
You're shivering.

525
01:06:57,061 --> 01:06:58,061
What are you going to do?

526
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,530
You must be excited to hear the sound.

527
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:13,150
You are very sensitive.

528
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,201
It's still too early to make progress.

529
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,190
Hey, let's have more fun.

530
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,560
No.

531
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,731
Do you want to be more comfortable?

532
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:39,760
Do you want to be more comfortable?

533
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,340
Please take it off.

534
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,400
Take it off and show me.

535
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,900
Hurry up.

536
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,541
Show me your disgusting body.

537
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,640
Hurry up.

538
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,400
Hurry up.

539
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,780
Show me your bra.

540
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:03,600
What's wrong
with you? I'm tired.

541
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:07,050


542
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:08,590
You have a bad body.

543
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:10,830
I can't stand it.

544
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,910
Look at this.

545
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,050
Look at this.

546
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,700
Look at this.

547
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,491
Do you like Chikurin that much?

548
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:46,240
Do you like Chikurin that much?

549
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,820
Your neck is swollen.

550
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,740
Your neck is swollen.

551
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:27,160
I'll give you a stronger massage.

552
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:28,860
I'll give you a stronger massage.

553
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,520
I'm sorry.

554
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:41,220
What's wrong?

555
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,260
Did you feel it only on your nipples?

556
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,540
Hey.

557
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:49,840
Do you feel it only on your nipples?

558
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,640
Hey.

559
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,560
Come here.

560
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,120
What will happen if I press here?

561
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:22,200
Where do you want me to press?

562
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:26,840
I want you to put it on my belly.

563
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,996
I want you to put it on my belly.

564
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,580
I don't know if you have a lot of hair.

565
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,240
Please put it on my belly.

566
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,160
Your belly.

567
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,100
Please put it on my belly.

568
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,020
Here.

569
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,220
Here.

570
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:56,980
It's so comfortable.

571
01:10:57,785 --> 01:11:09,700
Please put it on my belly.

572
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,340
Did you put it on?

573
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,460
Please put it on.

574
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,120
You did a good job.

575
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,580
You are amazing.

576
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,240
I can't show you to the manager.

577
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:37,160
I can't show you to such a strong wife.

578
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,500
Do you want me to do it directly?

579
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,441
Do you want me to do it directly?

580
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,460
Mr.Oshiro,

581
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,120
Yes?

582
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,720
Please let me lie down directly.

583
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,320
I'll put you on the bed.

584
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:11,920
Okay?

585
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:23,530
You have to lie down firmly.

586
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,070
I can't move my hips.

587
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,030
I'm scared.

588
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,860
I can't move my hips.

589
01:12:51,685 --> 01:12:53,220
I'll put you on the bed.

590
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,840
It hurts.

591
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,970
You are too fat.

592
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,050
I'm sorry.

593
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:32,950
You're getting crazy.

594
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:34,830
You're crazy enough.

595
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:38,310
I can't show you to the manager.

596
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:43,930
I want you to be stronger.

597
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,150
Hey.

598
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,400
I'm sorry.

599
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,300
I'm sorry.

600
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,580
I'm sorry.

601
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:19,520
Are you okay?

602
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,170
You are still in a coma.

603
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,210
You are still in a coma.

604
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,190
You are still in a coma.

605
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:45,191
It's wet, it's wet.

606
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,970
It's wet.

607
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,190
Do you want to get out?

608
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,600
Do you want to get out?

609
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:28,360
I don't want to.

610
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,430
Honey, hang in there.

611
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,680
I want you to do it.

612
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,160

614
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
toward me

615
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,981
hold on If you don't want to
do it, you have to do it properly.

616
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,200
I want to go home.

617
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,140
I want to go home.

618
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:14,240
I want to go home, but I want to go home.

619
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,620
Do you want to
feel good? I can't.

620
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,800
I'm hungry.

621
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,440


622
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,840
You're hungry, aren't you?

623
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:43,020
I thought I was a little bit nervous.

624
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:43,420
I was so scared that I
couldn't move my legs.

625
01:17:43,421 --> 01:17:45,040
I'm so sorry.

626
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
I was so scared.

627
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,320
I'm so sorry.

628
01:17:50,321 --> 01:17:53,380
Oh, Oh, Oh!

629
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,020
You've had enough.

630
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:18,780
Ah! Ah! Ah!

631
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,780
Ah, Ah, I am sorry.

632
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:37,540
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...

633
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,240
Ah...

634
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,421
Are you pushing yourself into the bed?

635
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:09,060
Yusuke is all over the bed.

636
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,480
Yusuke is playing with Goma.

637
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,800
Yusuke, you are another kind of
dog that doesn't care about Goma.

638
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,220
What will happen if Kuritori-san does this?

639
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,460
Please help me!

640
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,080
What? Do you want it?

641
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,440
Please help me!

642
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,600
Kuritori-san!

643
01:19:49,900 --> 01:20:35,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

644
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,960
I can't do it anymore.

645
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:52,220
I can't do it anymore.

646
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:58,900
I'm getting more and more depressed.

647
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,650
You're getting more and more depressed.

648
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:17,010
Good morning.

649
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:20,330

Please help me.

654
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:41,170
Mom, I can't get out of the room.

655
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:45,130
I'm scared.

656
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:54,850
I can't get out of the room.

657
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,090
I can't get out of the room.

658
01:21:56,290 --> 01:22:05,150
I can't get out of the room.

659
01:22:05,151 --> 01:22:06,710
Open it and show it to me.

660
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,490
Give me everything.

Show it to me.

Hurry up.

665
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,890
Put it in.

666
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,540
You like this,
don't you? I can't.

667
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,140
I'm going to put you in a box.

668
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:56,050
I can't stand it anymore.

669
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:33,260
I can't stand it anymore.

670
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:34,440
What the hell is
this guy? I'm so tired.

671
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,460
I'm so tired.

Hurry up.

676
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,220


677
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,660
I want you to hurry up.

678
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:28,500
Wife, how many times
have you been doing it?

679
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,200
What?

680
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,470
I want you to hurry up.

681
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:40,030
I want you to hurry up.

682
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,250
Do you want this
again? I want that.

683
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,660


684
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:50,940
You want to take more, don't you?

685
01:25:50,941 --> 01:25:52,640
I want you to let me go.

686
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,130
Give me more.

687
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:06,670
You'll feel better.

688
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:23,970
What do you want?

689
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,990
I want to go to the bathroom.

690
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,606
I want to go to the bathroom.

691
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:31,630
To the bathroom?

692
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:33,890
I want to go to heaven.

693
01:26:38,815 --> 01:26:42,890
I want to go to heaven.

694
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:45,690
I want to go to heaven.

695
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,270
I want to go to heaven.

696
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:49,271
I want to go to heaven.

697
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:50,610
I want to go to heaven.

698
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,830
Good morning.

699
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:25,850
It doesn't have to be in such a hurry.

700
01:27:33,105 --> 01:27:35,030
I want to do a lot.

701
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:37,250
I want to do a lot.

702
01:27:41,510 --> 01:28:02,120
It's so pleasant.

703
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:03,740
I want to sleep more.

704
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,080
It's so pleasant.

705
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:20,040
I'm sorry.

706
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,280
I'm sorry.

707
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,360
I'm sorry.

708
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,360
I'm sorry.

709
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,000
Oh...

710
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:09,330
I'm sorry...

711
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:19,600
I'm sorry I didn't be good to you.

712
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,080
I feel so good...

713
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,440
It feels so good.

714
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,380
My body feels so good.

715
01:29:26,381 --> 01:29:27,500
Just by licking it.

716
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,320
It's so good.

717
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,080
It feels so good.

718
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,500
I want to go to the bathroom.

719
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:48,500
It feels so good.

720
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,600
It feels so good.

721
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:57,560
I love you.

722
01:30:06,645 --> 01:30:08,300
I love you.

723
01:30:08,301 --> 01:30:09,301
I love you.

724
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,930
I love you.

725
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,230
I'm sorry.

726
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,750
I can't take it anymore.

727
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:39,190
I want a tail.

728
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:42,110
I want a tail.

729
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:46,630
I want a tail.

730
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:54,130
I want a tail.

731
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:55,180
I want a tail.

732
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,630
I'm sorry.

733
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:07,590
I'm sorry.

734
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:38,170
I'm sorry.

735
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:03,460
I'm not done yet.

736
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:05,960
I'm not done yet.

737
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:12,680
I want you to bully me more.

738
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,180
I want you to bully me more.

739
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:17,751
Then, you should do it quickly.

740
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,776
Then, you should do it quickly.

741
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,760
I'm not done yet.

742
01:32:22,761 --> 01:32:26,660
Hurry up and put me in the car.

743
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:31,800
Please help me.

744
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,380
I can't get in the car.

745
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:08,730
I can't get in the car.

746
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,630
I can't get in the car.

747
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,750
Please help me.

748
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:44,990
My daughter is crying
because her face is hurt.

749
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,210
Oh, it feels good.

750
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:05,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

751
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,430
Oh, it feels good.

752
01:34:18,595 --> 01:34:19,595
Oh, it feels good.

753
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:25,690
Oh, it feels good.

754
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:55,653
My husband and I have been living in this house for a long time

755
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
What's wrong? I want a bath.

756
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,160


757
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:15,960
You want a bath?

758
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,900
I'm sorry, I can't do it anymore.

759
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,280
I'm sorry, I can't do it anymore.

760
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,460
I want a bath.

761
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:27,400
I want to breathe deeply.

762
01:35:27,401 --> 01:35:28,401
I want you to sleep.

763
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,020
You grew up.

764
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,100
I want you to sleep.

765
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,300
I want you to sleep.

766
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,060
You are amazing.

767
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:02,820
I was able to get a good night's sleep.

768
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:08,360
I was able to sleep well.

769
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:13,240
I was able to sleep well.

770
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:20,240
I was able to sleep well.

771
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,340
I was able to sleep well.

772
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:47,941
I don't know why, but
she's not eating the food.

773
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:52,900
I'm sure she wants to eat it all.

774
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:59,360
I'm not sure if it's because
she's a little hungry.

775
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:02,260
I'm sure she's trying to
eat it, but she's not eating it.

776
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:08,770
You did a good job.

777
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:33,260
You did a good job.

778
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,660
I want to go home ASAP.

779
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,880
There is a lot of Tsingtao.

780
01:37:51,405 --> 01:38:00,660
The cat is exhausted from a long trip.

781
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,620
The cat is crying because
the owner broke the door.

782
01:38:06,621 --> 01:38:07,760
I'm sorry.

783
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:08,761
I'm sorry.

784
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:09,980
It's okay.

785
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,480
I'll give you a little more.

786
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:32,170
I'll give you a little more.

787
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:34,210
I'm sorry.

788
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:36,290
I'm sorry.

789
01:38:52,945 --> 01:38:54,860
Quickly please..

790
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:56,310
Please help me.

791
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,760
Please... Please
help me quickly.

792
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,320
I'll hit you with a stick.

793
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,700
Let me have a look at your left leg.

794
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Please hurry.

795
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,060
Please hurry.

796
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:10,800
Let me have a look.

797
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:13,500
It hurts so much.

798
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:14,900
I can't walk.

799
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:16,180
What's this?

800
01:39:16,181 --> 01:39:17,320
Oh, my God!

801
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,040
Oh, my God!

802
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,600
Oh, my God!

803
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,360
Oh, my God!

804
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:35,980
Oh, my God!

805
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:37,260
Oh, my God!

806
01:39:37,261 --> 01:39:38,261
Oh, my God!

807
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:45,810
Oh, my God!

808
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:47,030
Oh, my God!

809
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,350
Oh, my God!

810
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:49,730
Oh, my God!

811
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:50,850
Oh, my God!

812
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:52,010
Oh, my God!

813
01:40:00,245 --> 01:40:02,236
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

814
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,260
I'm so sorry.

815
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,530
I'm so sorry.

816
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:19,590
I'm so sorry.

817
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:24,650
I'm so sorry.

818
01:40:24,651 --> 01:40:28,410
I'm going to sleep.

819
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:42,130
I'm going to sleep.

820
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:56,460
I can't get up.

821
01:40:56,461 --> 01:41:01,060
I can't get up.

822
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:04,140
I can't get up.

823
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,880
The night of August 14th, 2020

824
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:47,220
I was worried about the
movement of the baby.

825
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:51,420
I was worried about the
movement of the baby.

826
01:41:53,130 --> 01:42:05,320
I was worried about the
movement of the baby.

827
01:42:05,321 --> 01:42:06,321
Mom!

828
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:18,460
Oh, you're drooling.

829
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:20,480
I feel sick.

830
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:23,191
You're drooling from your mouth.

831
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:27,070
I feel sick.

832
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:30,580
I don't know what to do.

833
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,080
You're drooling.

834
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,920
I can't move.

835
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,300
I can't move.

836
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:46,560
I'm scared.

837
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:47,800
Ouch!

838
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:51,880
Ouch!

839
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:17,090
His leg is broken!

840
01:43:24,825 --> 01:43:26,170
I can't swallow it.

841
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:32,980
not at all.

842
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:37,120
I can't swallow it.

843
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:49,390
I can't.

844
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:59,170
I can't swallow.

845
01:44:33,985 --> 01:44:35,026
Put more milt on the butt.

846
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:41,030
I can't.

847
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:42,410
You have to spread it.

848
01:45:29,355 --> 01:45:30,600
I'm sorry.

849
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:51,440
I'm sorry.

850
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:21,290
I'm going to break it.

851
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:22,470
Can I break it?

852
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,880
I'm going to break it.

853
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:43,660
More, more, more.

854
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:55,040
I can't do it.

855
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,200
No, I don't want to go.

856
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,000
Mokko, come here.

857
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,700
Come here.

858
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:15,130
Stand up.

859
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:16,860
Stand up and put your butt out.

860
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,300
I'll carry you, Chimpo.

861
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:23,940
I don't want to go.

862
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,500
I don't want to go.

863
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:45,280
This morning, my husband and I woke up.

864
01:47:45,281 --> 01:48:04,020
The sleepiness of waking
up at night made us very hot.

865
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:26,500
Thank God it's
gone soon! I'm sorry.

866
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:38,040


867
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:55,180
I want you to do it more.

868
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:57,750
I want you to do it more.

869
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:02,740
I want you to do it more.

870
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:55,303
a family outpouring
lanzolas of sunshine rain

871
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:56,626
on their family to
rent tents and live in.

872
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,291
I know, but suddenly it didn't look good.

873
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:14,330
I want you to give me a lot of it.

874
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:18,250
I want you to give me a lot of it.

875
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:21,246
I want you to give me a lot of it.

876
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,830
I want you to give me a lot of it.

877
01:51:21,831 --> 01:51:23,191
I want you to give me a lot of it.

878
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:25,310
I want you to give me a lot of it.

879
01:51:26,670 --> 01:51:27,110
I want you to give me a lot of it.

880
01:51:27,111 --> 01:51:27,370
I want you to give me a lot of it.

881
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:27,730
I want you to give me a lot of it.

882
01:51:27,731 --> 01:51:28,731
Oh, it's painful.

883
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:30,910
Oh, it's painful.

884
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:36,730
Oh, it's painful.

885
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:48,610
It's still there.

886
01:51:51,690 --> 01:51:55,450
It's still there.

887
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:04,080
I'm going to bed.

888
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:28,360
I think it's time for the
director to come home.

889
01:52:28,361 --> 01:52:33,520
I'm going home.

890
01:52:36,810 --> 01:53:13,070
Mom, I'm home.

891
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:14,071
I'm home.

892
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:19,830
Mom, are you coming?

893
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:25,710
Hey, what's with this
school? It's the worst.

894
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:30,470


895
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,450
What's wrong?

896
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:36,150
All your grudges are against me.

897
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:38,610
What?

898
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:41,970
You're going to be fired early tomorrow.

899
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:50,980
That's enough.

900
01:53:52,475 --> 01:53:53,760
What are you doing? Break up.

901
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,560


902
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:00,370
You son of a bitch.
