1
3.89 --> 6.69
 Huh? Why? Where are you going?

2
6.69 --> 8.29
 It's fine.

3
8.29 --> 11.09
 Are you gambling again?

4
11.09 --> 12.69
 I'll pay you back double.

5
12.69 --> 14.79
 Hey, stop working.

6
14.79 --> 16.69
 Shut up!

7
17.89 --> 19.39
 You're a bad girl.

8
19.39 --> 22.49
 Give me back my money.

9
22.49 --> 41.85
 You're so persistent.

10
41.85 --> 46.19
 I said I'll pay you back double.

11
46.19 --> 51.04
 Wait.

12
51.04 --> 53.04
 Erika?

13
53.04 --> 54.64
 I'm sorry.

14
54.64 --> 57.74
 I remembered what my ex-boyfriend said.

15
57.74 --> 59.64
 I'm sorry.

16
59.64 --> 62.99
 Don't worry.

17
62.99 --> 67.59
 Traumas don't disappear so easily.

18
67.59 --> 71.59
 But I'm here for you.

19
71.59 --> 74.89
 Don't worry.

20
74.89 --> 76.59
 What?

21
76.59 --> 87.66
 I told you I'd forget all your painful past.

22
87.66 --> 88.86
 Thank you.

23
88.86 --> 92.56
 I'm glad I met you.

24
92.56 --> 99.46
 But I need you.

25
99.46 --> 106.26
 So I want to do my best for you.

26
106.26 --> 109.06
 Yeah.

27
109.06 --> 111.26
 Well...

28
111.26 --> 115.06
 It's good to be happy only with you.

29
115.86 --> 118.06
 I want to have a baby.

30
118.06 --> 121.76
 But I want to have at least two children.

31
121.76 --> 124.66
 A boy and a girl.

32
124.66 --> 126.56
 A family of four.

33
126.56 --> 128.56
 Yeah.

34
128.56 --> 132.26
 I'll do my best for you.

35
132.26 --> 135.06
 You don't have to worry about me.

36
135.06 --> 137.46
 You'll take care of me.

37
137.46 --> 138.66
 Yeah.

38
138.66 --> 141.26
 I'll do my best for you, too.

39
141.26 --> 148.47
 You're so good.

40
148.47 --> 149.77
 Really?

41
149.77 --> 151.37
 I'm so happy.

42
151.37 --> 155.24
 I'm glad to hear that.

43
155.24 --> 158.24
 I'll go with you.

44
158.24 --> 160.34
 I'm sorry.

45
160.34 --> 185.81
 I'll go with you.

46
185.81 --> 189.11
 Are you okay, Erika?

47
189.11 --> 192.41
 Yeah, I'm fine.

48
192.41 --> 196.51
 Are you going to do telework this week?

49
196.51 --> 199.21
 Yeah, I'll do it for a while.

50
199.21 --> 201.21
 I see.

51
201.21 --> 206.51
 Let's go out together this weekend.

52
206.51 --> 209.51
 Are you busy this week?

53
209.51 --> 214.41
 Yeah, but I'll go with you.

54
214.41 --> 215.81
 Really?

55
215.81 --> 218.01
 Thank you.

56
218.01 --> 220.91
 I'm looking forward to it.

57
220.91 --> 224.91
 I'll be happy if you're happy.

58
224.91 --> 228.11
 Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

59
228.11 --> 229.91
 Where are you going?

60
230.01 --> 231.91
 Where are you going?

61
231.91 --> 233.51
 I want to go to the sea.

62
233.51 --> 235.71
 I want to go to a concert.

63
235.71 --> 238.01
 I'll drive.

64
238.01 --> 239.61
 You're kind.

65
239.61 --> 242.81
 No, I'm not.

66
242.81 --> 245.71
 I'm glad I met you.

67
245.71 --> 249.51
 I'm glad I met you, too.

68
249.51 --> 250.81
 Really?

69
250.81 --> 252.31
 I'm glad to hear that.

70
252.31 --> 254.41
 Thank you for everything.

71
254.41 --> 255.91
 Thank you, too.

72
256.01 --> 263.23
 I'm so tired.

73
263.23 --> 266.73
 What?

74
266.73 --> 271.62
 I'm so tired.

75
271.62 --> 278.51
 No.

76
278.51 --> 280.21
 Let's do this.

77
280.21 --> 280.81
 What?

78
280.81 --> 283.11
 It feels good.

79
283.11 --> 285.11
 What is this?

80
285.11 --> 287.21
 I bought this on the internet.

81
287.21 --> 288.91
 It's a very sexy feeling.

82
288.91 --> 291.01
 What is this?

83
291.01 --> 291.81
 It feels good.

84
291.81 --> 292.81
 No.

85
292.81 --> 294.11
 I have a question for you.

86
294.11 --> 294.81
 Yes.

87
294.91 --> 297.51
 I've been sleeping a lot lately.

88
297.51 --> 299.11
 I'm excited.

89
299.11 --> 300.61
 It feels good.

90
300.61 --> 303.31
 What are you thinking about?

91
303.31 --> 304.91
 I don't want to drink.

92
304.91 --> 307.61
 Let's drink together.

93
307.61 --> 308.61
 It feels good.

94
308.61 --> 311.11
 I don't want to drink.

95
311.11 --> 316.28
 I don't want to drink.

96
316.28 --> 320.28
 Don't lie to me.

97
320.28 --> 322.28
 I can't drink anymore.

98
322.28 --> 324.58
 I don't drink for money.

99
324.68 --> 328.18
 I can't drink anymore.

100
328.18 --> 329.88
 I can't drink with you anymore.

101
329.88 --> 336.76
 Wait a minute.

102
336.76 --> 339.96
 Erika.

103
339.96 --> 344.70
 Let me go.

104
344.70 --> 346.70
 I'm sorry.

105
346.70 --> 351.73
 Did you have a bad dream?

106
351.73 --> 358.53
 If you are tired, you don't have to go out.

107
358.53 --> 359.83
 I'm fine.

108
359.83 --> 364.54
 I'm looking forward to going out.

109
364.54 --> 366.84
 What's wrong with you lately?

110
366.84 --> 369.84
 You have a lot of scary dreams.

111
369.84 --> 371.34
 I'm fine.

112
371.34 --> 373.34
 I'm with you.

113
373.34 --> 383.96
 You don't have to remember the past.

114
383.96 --> 387.46
 Then I ran away from the worst ex-boyfriend.

115
387.46 --> 390.86
 I was able to meet him now.

116
390.86 --> 393.16
 He is kind now.

117
393.16 --> 396.56
 He accepts everything about me.

118
396.56 --> 400.06
 My current life is happiness.

119
400.06 --> 405.36
 I thought that such days would last forever.

120
405.36 --> 407.76
 What's wrong?

121
407.76 --> 413.59
 I like you.

122
413.59 --> 437.04
 I will definitely make you happy.

123
437.04 --> 439.94
 Erika.

124
439.94 --> 442.24
 Erika.

125
442.24 --> 444.14
 Do you live around here?

126
444.14 --> 445.04
 Let me go.

127
445.04 --> 446.44
 It's been a long time.

128
446.44 --> 447.44
 I've always wanted to see you.

129
447.44 --> 448.64
 Let me go.

130
448.64 --> 450.04
 I can't.

131
450.04 --> 452.24
 Let me go.

132
452.34 --> 497.97
 Erika.

133
497.97 --> 499.37
 I'm back.

134
499.37 --> 501.37
 Welcome back.

135
501.37 --> 503.77
 Please sign here.

136
503.77 --> 505.97
 Thank you.

137
505.97 --> 514.33
 Thank you.

138
514.33 --> 516.93
 I got a package.

139
516.93 --> 522.32
 It's hard to deliver.

140
522.32 --> 525.02
 Erika.

141
525.02 --> 526.82
 What's wrong?

142
526.82 --> 529.02
 Erika.

143
529.02 --> 531.52
 Are you my friend?

144
531.92 --> 533.22
 Yes.

145
533.22 --> 537.20
 It's been a long time.

146
537.20 --> 539.10
 Are you my boyfriend?

147
539.10 --> 541.00
 Yes.

148
541.00 --> 542.30
 You are kind.

149
542.30 --> 545.93
 I'm glad to meet you.

150
545.93 --> 547.83
 Thank you.

151
547.83 --> 550.93
 I'm sorry.

152
550.93 --> 553.33
 See you.

153
553.33 --> 560.84
 Thank you.

154
560.84 --> 562.74
 You are different from the past.

155
562.74 --> 566.04
 You are a delivery man.

156
566.14 --> 568.04
 I was surprised.

157
568.04 --> 570.44
 Yes.

158
570.44 --> 574.04
 I will put the luggage there.

159
574.04 --> 588.72
 See you.

160
588.72 --> 635.78
 Erika seems to be happy.

161
635.78 --> 639.78
 I was too happy.

162
639.78 --> 642.38
 I left the room.

163
642.38 --> 646.38
 I'm sorry.

164
646.38 --> 649.78
 I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

165
649.88 --> 663.17
 I have a lot of work to do.

166
663.17 --> 665.77
 Do you have a lot of work to do tomorrow?

167
665.77 --> 668.79
 Yes.

168
668.79 --> 674.59
 You don't have to worry about commuting.

169
674.59 --> 677.49
 I agree.

170
677.49 --> 681.19
 It takes a long time to commute.

171
681.19 --> 688.48
 I envy you.

172
688.48 --> 692.54
 I want to do it again.

173
692.54 --> 695.94
 You can't do it again.

174
695.94 --> 697.54
 I was surprised.

175
697.54 --> 702.24
 You have a lot of friends.

176
702.24 --> 706.44
 The world is small.

177
706.44 --> 710.24
 Do you know each other?

178
710.24 --> 714.64
 Yes.

179
714.64 --> 720.52
 You are a good person.

180
720.52 --> 726.02
 It's hard to work in the summer.

181
726.02 --> 733.98
 You have a lot of good friends.

182
734.08 --> 737.08
 Erika, are you okay?

183
737.08 --> 740.72
 I'm sorry.

184
740.72 --> 757.76
 I'm going to the bathroom.

185
757.76 --> 763.48
 Yes.

186
763.48 --> 770.32
 I haven't seen you for a long time.

187
770.32 --> 772.72
 Why are you running away?

188
772.72 --> 776.92
 I'm depressed because you're gone.

189
776.92 --> 779.12
 You are the luckiest woman.

190
779.12 --> 783.20
 I can't go home.

191
783.20 --> 784.80
 I came to see you.

192
784.80 --> 786.40
 Please go home.

193
786.50 --> 790.10
 Go home and I'll take care of you.

194
790.10 --> 830.02
 Talk to me.

195
830.02 --> 844.70
 Please talk to me.

196
850.70 --> 853.90
 Don't talk.

197
853.90 --> 856.30
 Please listen to me.

198
861.78 --> 898.17
 You are sick here.

199
898.17 --> 912.20
 Is it hard?

200
912.20 --> 914.20
 What's wrong?

201
914.20 --> 918.09
 Are you hungry?

202
918.09 --> 920.09
 Did you come to ask me?

203
923.09 --> 928.11
 Your body is warm, isn't it?

204
928.11 --> 930.11
 How about here?

205
937.08 --> 939.08
 Do you understand?

206
939.08 --> 943.36
 You feel good, don't you?

207
943.36 --> 945.36
 What's wrong?

208
945.36 --> 947.36
 Look

209
947.36 --> 949.36
 Here

210
949.36 --> 951.36
 You feel good, don't you?

211
955.18 --> 957.18
 Look at me

212
963.18 --> 969.76
 What's wrong?

213
969.76 --> 971.76
 You said no

214
994.41 --> 996.41
 What's wrong?

215
996.41 --> 998.41
 Look at me

216
998.41 --> 1000.41
 You feel good, don't you?

217
1002.41 --> 1004.41
 Look at me

218
1009.07 --> 1011.07
 Look

219
1011.07 --> 1013.07
 You are excited

220
1026.24 --> 1028.24
 Look at me

221
1040.20 --> 1042.20
 You are so erotic

222
1044.20 --> 1047.77
 You like me, don't you?

223
1047.77 --> 1049.77
 No

224
1049.77 --> 1051.77
 Look

225
1051.77 --> 1053.77
 You said no

226
1059.77 --> 1083.34
 You feel good, don't you?

227
1083.34 --> 1088.32
 What's wrong?

228
1088.32 --> 1108.91
 You are excited

229
1108.91 --> 1116.96
 Look at me

230
1116.96 --> 1118.96
 You are so wet

231
1118.96 --> 1149.63
 You feel good, don't you?

232
1149.63 --> 1151.63
 You feel good, don't you?

233
1181.50 --> 1183.50
 You feel good, don't you?

234
1188.99 --> 1190.99
 We have a good chemistry

235
1190.99 --> 1192.99
 Look

236
1235.66 --> 1240.89
 You are so wet

237
1242.89 --> 1244.89
 You look like a wet cat

238
1244.89 --> 1246.89
 I'm going to take you away

239
1274.41 --> 1304.99
 I don't think you can run away

240
1304.99 --> 1366.09
 You can't run away

241
1366.09 --> 1368.09
 What's this?

242
1370.09 --> 1372.09
 You noticed

243
1372.09 --> 1374.09
 What's this?

244
1376.09 --> 1378.09
 You

245
1378.09 --> 1380.09
 What's this?

246
1380.09 --> 1384.04
 You can't run away

247
1384.04 --> 1386.04
 Stop

248
1390.19 --> 1392.19
 Look at that

249
1392.19 --> 1394.19
 You look good

250
1396.19 --> 1399.56
 Stop

251
1399.56 --> 1401.56
 Show me

252
1401.56 --> 1403.56
 It's been a long time

253
1403.56 --> 1405.56
 How do you feel?

254
1407.56 --> 1412.86
 You are still beautiful

255
1423.29 --> 1427.50
 What do you think?

256
1427.50 --> 1432.80
 Look at me

257
1432.80 --> 1434.80
 Stop

258
1434.80 --> 1436.80
 Look

259
1444.94 --> 1446.94
 I have a boyfriend

260
1446.94 --> 1448.94
 You had a boyfriend yesterday

261
1450.94 --> 1455.53
 Are you happy with your boyfriend?

262
1457.53 --> 1459.53
 I'm going to make you happier

263
1459.53 --> 1461.53
 No

264
1461.53 --> 1463.53
 What?

265
1463.53 --> 1465.53
 How did you feel?

266
1465.53 --> 1467.53
 You feel better, don't you?

267
1467.53 --> 1469.53
 No

268
1469.53 --> 1471.53
 Open your mouth

269
1471.53 --> 1473.53
 No

270
1473.53 --> 1475.53
 Don't bite

271
1475.53 --> 1482.17
 Open your mouth

272
1482.17 --> 1484.17
 No eyes

273
1484.17 --> 1497.02
 You don't feel good, do you?

274
1499.02 --> 1501.02
 You used to have pretty eyes

275
1503.02 --> 1505.02
 Stop

276
1505.02 --> 1510.19
 Look

277
1519.44 --> 1521.44
 Look

278
1521.44 --> 1523.44
 Look at you

279
1525.44 --> 1527.44
 Look

280
1536.32 --> 1538.32
 How do you feel?

281
1538.32 --> 1542.14
 Look

282
1552.00 --> 1555.63
 I'm going to make you feel better

283
1566.49 --> 1571.15
 How do you feel?

284
1581.55 --> 1583.55
 What?

285
1583.55 --> 1585.55
 Be honest

286
1585.55 --> 1590.33
 Be honest

287
1592.33 --> 1594.33
 Look

288
1594.33 --> 1596.33
 Stop

289
1596.33 --> 1598.33
 Look

290
1602.33 --> 1621.42
 Just a little

291
1629.29 --> 1643.42
 Do you feel good?

292
1645.42 --> 1649.95
 What?

293
1649.95 --> 1654.99
 Are you done?

294
1654.99 --> 1669.79
 No

295
1669.79 --> 1671.79
 Next

296
1673.79 --> 1677.16
 What?

297
1677.16 --> 1679.16
 You are still beautiful

298
1681.16 --> 1688.06
 You are still beautiful

299
1688.06 --> 1690.06
 Where do you want to be painted?

300
1690.06 --> 1692.06
 Here

301
1694.06 --> 1705.95
 How do you feel?

302
1740.32 --> 1742.32
 How do you feel?

303
1742.32 --> 1744.32
 Do you feel good?

304
1746.32 --> 1748.32
 Do you feel good?

305
1748.32 --> 1751.76
 Do you like this?

306
1765.21 --> 1774.92
 Do you feel good?

307
1776.92 --> 1778.92
 Do you feel good?

308
1782.92 --> 1784.92
 Look

309
1791.07 --> 1795.98
 It's hot, isn't it?

310
1795.98 --> 1805.82
 How do you feel?

311
1805.82 --> 1807.82
 I'm checking

312
1807.82 --> 1809.82
 You are breathing deeply

313
1835.56 --> 1845.21
 I want you to touch

314
1849.21 --> 1851.21
 It feels good even if you don't touch

315
1851.21 --> 1853.21
 Don't you think it feels good if you touch?

316
1862.09 --> 1864.09
 I want you to touch

317
1864.09 --> 1866.09
 Look

318
1866.09 --> 1868.09
 Here

319
1868.09 --> 1874.48
 I want you to touch

320
1931.10 --> 1933.10
 What's wrong?

321
1933.10 --> 1937.95
 You are grumpy

322
1937.95 --> 1942.54
 You want to go

323
1942.54 --> 1944.54
 What?

324
1944.54 --> 1946.54
 You can't?

325
1946.54 --> 1961.82
 You can't?

326
1961.82 --> 1963.82
 Did you miss it?

327
1972.76 --> 1978.83
 What?

328
1978.83 --> 1990.94
 Where do you want to be painted?

329
1990.94 --> 1992.94
 Here?

330
1992.94 --> 1994.94
 How do you feel?

331
1994.94 --> 1996.94
 What?

332
2000.94 --> 2002.94
 You can go

333
2019.69 --> 2023.45
 What's wrong?

334
2023.45 --> 2049.10
 You can go

335
2049.10 --> 2051.10
 You can fall

336
2051.10 --> 2075.60
 Fall

337
2075.60 --> 2077.60
 You are so quiet

338
2077.60 --> 2079.60
 You guys look good

339
2079.60 --> 2084.32
 You guys are close

340
2086.32 --> 2088.32
 You guys are close

341
2108.97 --> 2134.45
 What? What? What are you saying?

342
2139.13 --> 2161.90
 Show me more spirit.

343
2164.90 --> 2169.21
 It's getting harder and harder.

344
2199.07 --> 2201.07
 Do you want to be bullied more?

345
2202.07 --> 2204.07
 Hey, be honest.

346
2205.07 --> 2207.07
 You want to be bullied more, don't you?

347
2208.07 --> 2213.64
 What?

348
2214.64 --> 2217.72
 What?

349
2317.18 --> 2322.67
 Do you want to be bullied more?

350
2346.18 --> 2356.28
 Show me more of your tongue.

351
2384.83 --> 2386.83
 Your mouth is very sensitive.

352
2386.83 --> 2400.25
 Get used to it.

353
2427.23 --> 2428.23
 Look up.

354
2430.23 --> 2434.31
 Look up and open your mouth.

355
2449.61 --> 2455.23
 You like it, don't you?

356
2464.01 --> 2510.30
 You like it, don't you?

357
2532.95 --> 2534.95
 Do you like it?

358
2548.58 --> 2550.58
 Your mouth is very sensitive.

359
2554.15 --> 2559.76
 Get used to it.

360
2575.96 --> 2577.96
 You have a good right hand.

361
2578.96 --> 2580.96
 Touch it.

362
2584.96 --> 2632.40
 Open your mouth.

363
2649.93 --> 2657.56
 What?

364
2658.56 --> 2663.53
 How is it?

365
2667.70 --> 2668.70
 Maybe...

366
2669.70 --> 2670.70
 What?

367
2671.70 --> 2673.70
 You like it, don't you?

368
2679.68 --> 2683.31
 You like it, don't you?

369
2683.31 --> 2689.24
 Where do you want to be bullied?

370
2689.24 --> 2692.62
 I want to be bullied.

371
2692.62 --> 2695.93
 You want to be bullied.

372
2695.93 --> 2718.49
 You can pick it up again.

373
2718.49 --> 2728.91
 Where's the rubber band?

374
2728.91 --> 2730.91
 What?

375
2730.91 --> 2732.91
 Where's the rubber band?

376
2732.91 --> 2736.28
 I can't put it on you.

377
2736.28 --> 2738.28
 Put it on me.

378
2738.28 --> 2740.28
 I can't do it.

379
2740.28 --> 2742.28
 I can only do it live.

380
2748.16 --> 2751.72
 What's wrong?

381
2751.72 --> 2753.72
 You've been trembling all the time.

382
2753.72 --> 2769.71
 What's wrong?

383
2769.71 --> 2792.80
 You're trembling a lot.

384
2796.80 --> 2800.88
 You're drooling.

385
2849.00 --> 2851.00
 What's wrong?

386
2851.00 --> 2891.66
 What's wrong?

387
2893.66 --> 2895.66
 I'll put it on you.

388
2895.66 --> 2913.82
 I'll put it on you.

389
2913.82 --> 2915.82
 I'll put it on you.

390
2915.82 --> 2927.52
 It feels good, right?

391
2929.52 --> 2931.52
 I'll put it on you.

392
2947.18 --> 2949.18
 It feels so good.

393
2954.03 --> 2956.03
 You're drooling a lot.

394
2958.03 --> 2962.88
 Your hips are moving a lot.

395
2968.88 --> 2970.88
 Your hips are moving a lot.

396
2972.88 --> 3020.57
 It feels good, right?

397
3020.57 --> 3043.60
 It feels good, right?

398
3043.60 --> 3045.60
 You're drooling a lot.

399
3045.60 --> 3069.68
 You're drooling a lot.

400
3073.18 --> 3217.26
 It feels good, right?

401
3217.26 --> 3219.26
 You're drooling a lot.

402
3258.60 --> 3274.33
 Look at me.

403
3274.33 --> 3309.42
 Look at me.

404
3309.42 --> 3369.76
 It feels good, right?

405
3443.87 --> 3455.18
 It feels so good.

406
3455.18 --> 3507.32
 It feels so good.

407
3507.32 --> 3509.32
 It feels good.

408
3509.32 --> 3511.32
 Does it feel good?

409
3511.32 --> 3519.76
 No, no, no.

410
3519.76 --> 3584.12
 Do you want to turn it around?

411
3584.12 --> 3629.48
 No?

412
3629.48 --> 3640.03
 It's overflowing.

413
3647.95 --> 3649.95
 It was really good.

414
3656.72 --> 3658.72
 I'll let you play with it from now on.

415
3664.35 --> 3666.35
 I'll put this video on the Internet.

416
3666.35 --> 3668.35
 You don't want to be separated, do you?

417
3681.84 --> 3683.84
 It feels really good.

418
3702.84 --> 3716.20
 Erika.

419
3716.20 --> 3718.20
 Erika.

420
3720.20 --> 3722.20
 Erika.

421
3722.20 --> 3724.20
 I'm sorry.

422
3724.20 --> 3726.20
 Are you okay?

423
3726.20 --> 3728.20
 I was nervous.

424
3728.20 --> 3730.20
 I'm looking forward to going out for the first time in a long time.

425
3732.20 --> 3734.20
 I can't wait for the end of the year.

426
3734.20 --> 3738.03
 Where did you go, Erika?

427
3738.03 --> 3747.16
 Maybe.

428
3749.16 --> 3751.16
 Maybe.

429
3751.16 --> 3753.16
 It's popular now.

430
3753.16 --> 3755.16
 But it's hot.

431
3755.16 --> 3757.16
 Maybe it's the sea.

432
3759.16 --> 3761.16
 You have a lot of delicious food.

433
3761.16 --> 3763.16
 I'm going to get sunburned.

434
3763.16 --> 3765.16
 I'll lend you a tent.

435
3765.16 --> 3767.16
 I don't want to get sunburned.

436
3771.16 --> 3773.16
 I don't want to get sunburned.

437
3775.16 --> 3777.16
 If you get sunburned all over your body, you'll never get sunburned.

438
3797.32 --> 3800.83
 It's a nice room.

439
3800.83 --> 3804.84
 You have a lot of money.

440
3804.84 --> 3806.84
 You live in a nice place.

441
3806.84 --> 3808.84
 You're having fun.

442
3815.10 --> 3817.10
 Are you having sex with him here?

443
3819.10 --> 3825.42
 Why are you panting?

444
3825.42 --> 3829.63
 I've already asked you.

445
3829.63 --> 3831.63
 I've only been here for a while.

446
3850.96 --> 3854.46
 Why are you so nervous?

447
3854.46 --> 3859.95
 Say something.

448
3861.95 --> 3867.76
 Go home.

449
3867.76 --> 3871.26
 Can I say that?

450
3871.26 --> 3876.04
 That video.

451
3876.04 --> 3878.04
 I posted it on the Internet.

452
3878.04 --> 3880.04
 I think it'll spread in an instant.

453
3880.04 --> 3882.04
 Your face is swollen.

454
3886.19 --> 3888.19
 Can I tell you to go home?

455
3892.01 --> 3896.86
 What?

456
3901.32 --> 3903.32
 You're so nervous.

457
3907.79 --> 3909.79
 You were so nervous yesterday.

458
3909.79 --> 3911.79
 What?

459
3911.79 --> 3915.16
 You're not satisfied?

460
3915.16 --> 3917.16
 That boyfriend.

461
3923.76 --> 3927.76
 I'll make you feel good in your usual bed.

462
3933.76 --> 3937.45
 Stop it.

463
3937.45 --> 3939.45
 You like this, don't you?

464
3939.45 --> 3941.45
 I don't want to.

465
3943.45 --> 3945.45
 Look up.

466
3945.45 --> 3947.45
 Look.

467
3947.45 --> 3949.45
 Open your mouth.

468
3949.45 --> 3957.82
 One more time.

469
3957.82 --> 3959.82
 Open your mouth.

470
3959.82 --> 3970.49
 Did you drink?

471
3970.49 --> 3972.49
 Did you drink?

472
3972.49 --> 3979.52
 What's wrong?

473
3979.52 --> 3983.47
 I asked you a question.

474
3987.47 --> 3989.47
 What's wrong?

475
3989.47 --> 3991.47
 You're just talking.

476
3991.47 --> 3993.47
 What?

477
3998.32 --> 4007.58
 Look.

478
4007.58 --> 4009.58
 Here.

479
4009.58 --> 4011.58
 What?

480
4011.58 --> 4025.52
 What?

481
4025.52 --> 4032.44
 Come here.

482
4034.44 --> 4036.44
 Open your mouth.

483
4036.44 --> 4040.91
 You want me to touch you, right?

484
4044.91 --> 4048.86
 Open your mouth.

485
4048.86 --> 4062.28
 Look.

486
4062.28 --> 4078.91
 Here.

487
4078.91 --> 4086.25
 What?

488
4086.25 --> 4088.25
 Look.

489
4088.25 --> 4095.34
 You feel good, don't you?

490
4095.34 --> 4097.34
 What?

491
4097.34 --> 4099.34
 What?

492
4099.34 --> 4109.44
 What?

493
4109.44 --> 4111.44
 You're leaving right away.

494
4111.44 --> 4132.03
 What?

495
4132.03 --> 4162.22
 I haven't touched your nipples yet.

496
4162.22 --> 4181.92
 Your nipples are growing.

497
4181.92 --> 4183.92
 What?

498
4183.92 --> 4185.92
 What did you say?

499
4185.92 --> 4199.34
 You're like a baby.

500
4199.34 --> 4223.96
 You're so playful.

501
4341.39 --> 4354.49
 You're so playful.

502
4354.49 --> 4362.54
 You're so playful.

503
4362.54 --> 4364.54
 You're too playful.

504
4413.32 --> 4415.32
 Look.

505
4417.32 --> 4434.01
 Look more.

506
4434.01 --> 4449.23
 What?

507
4449.23 --> 4454.52
 Can you see me well?

508
4454.52 --> 4460.59
 Are you a viewer?

509
4462.59 --> 4496.56
 This is too much, isn't it?

510
4539.62 --> 4554.29
 Get out of the way.

511
4554.29 --> 4556.29
 Get out of the way.

512
4557.29 --> 4562.46
 What's this?

513
4562.46 --> 4564.46
 It's messed up.

514
4566.46 --> 4582.25
 Do you feel it?

515
4582.25 --> 4584.25
 You're rubbing it.

516
4584.25 --> 4586.25
 Look.

517
4586.25 --> 4658.72
 You're not moving.

518
4658.72 --> 4683.50
 You're so mean.

519
4683.50 --> 4685.50
 You're so mean.

520
4685.50 --> 4687.50
 Look.

521
4687.50 --> 4689.50
 Look.

522
4689.50 --> 4691.50
 I know it's hard.

523
4691.50 --> 4698.14
 I know it's hard.

524
4698.14 --> 4700.14
 You're making a face.

525
4701.14 --> 4703.14
 You're rubbing it.

526
4709.14 --> 4711.14
 You're rubbing it.

527
4715.05 --> 4717.05
 What's wrong?

528
4717.05 --> 4719.05
 Look.

529
4719.05 --> 4723.39
 Do you want it?

530
4725.39 --> 4729.08
 If you want it,

531
4729.08 --> 4731.08
 You know what to do.

532
4738.08 --> 4760.92
 You're rubbing it.

533
4766.88 --> 4792.15
 Do you feel it?

534
4796.36 --> 4809.65
 What are you doing?

535
4812.67 --> 4814.67
 You're rubbing it.

536
4815.67 --> 4817.67
 Do you feel it?

537
4820.67 --> 4822.67
 Show me more.

538
4868.87 --> 4874.55
 I want this.

539
4875.55 --> 4879.56
 What do you want?

540
4879.56 --> 4881.56
 I want this.

541
4882.56 --> 4884.56
 Don't do that.

542
4884.56 --> 4893.70
 Look.

543
4894.70 --> 4900.83
 Be more careful.

544
4901.83 --> 4903.83
 Don't lick the back of your head.

545
4905.83 --> 4907.83
 You want it, don't you?

546
4913.83 --> 4942.74
 Do you feel it?

547
4943.74 --> 4963.05
 Do you feel it?

548
4963.05 --> 4965.05
 Open your mouth.

549
4974.91 --> 4976.91
 Lick it.

550
4981.91 --> 4987.72
 The cake is delicious.

551
4994.44 --> 4998.71
 You're sucking it.

552
4998.71 --> 5000.71
 You're sucking it.

553
5002.71 --> 5004.71
 You want me to put it in your mouth, don't you?

554
5041.46 --> 5052.39
 You want me to put it in your mouth, don't you?

555
5054.39 --> 5059.62
 You're so mean.

556
5148.22 --> 5150.22
 You're so mean.

557
5153.22 --> 5155.22
 You're so mean.

558
5171.38 --> 5173.38
 You want me to put it in your mouth, don't you?

559
5177.38 --> 5179.38
 You want me to put it in your mouth, don't you?

560
5181.38 --> 5185.84
 You're sucking it.

561
5186.84 --> 5194.70
 You're so mean.

562
5195.70 --> 5199.08
 You're so mean.

563
5201.08 --> 5207.78
 You're addicted to it.

564
5207.78 --> 5209.78
 You want me to put it in your mouth, don't you?

565
5209.78 --> 5226.02
 You're so mean.

566
5226.02 --> 5265.88
 You're so mean.

567
5265.88 --> 5267.88
 It's been a long time since you came to my room.

568
5269.88 --> 5271.88
 This is our love.

569
5281.56 --> 5283.56
 You want this, don't you?

570
5290.48 --> 5292.48
 You want this, don't you?

571
5296.39 --> 5298.39
 You want this, don't you?

572
5298.39 --> 5300.39
 What are you going to do?

573
5322.18 --> 5331.12
 What's wrong?

574
5331.12 --> 5333.12
 What's wrong?

575
5346.80 --> 5348.80
 What's wrong?

576
5388.60 --> 5401.32
 What are you doing?

577
5401.32 --> 5403.32
 What are you doing?

578
5403.32 --> 5405.32
 You feel so good.

579
5405.32 --> 5407.32
 You haven't even touched it yet.

580
5414.16 --> 5427.59
 I'm sure you'll feel better.

581
5427.59 --> 5438.71
 You remember this, don't you?

582
5445.67 --> 5450.71
 I was saying,

583
5450.71 --> 5452.71
 I'm sure you'll feel better.

584
5454.71 --> 5475.56
 Do you feel good?

585
5475.56 --> 5477.56
 Do you feel good?

586
5485.84 --> 5487.84
 You want it, don't you?

587
5487.84 --> 5501.58
 Look.

588
5501.58 --> 5505.66
 Look.

589
5505.66 --> 5507.66
 You feel great, don't you?

590
5517.16 --> 5521.30
 Come here.

591
5521.30 --> 5523.30
 What's wrong?

592
5542.16 --> 5545.86
 I see.

593
5547.86 --> 5549.86
 You want to have a lot of fun.

594
5549.86 --> 5551.86
 So, I prepared a lot of things for you.

595
5557.48 --> 5577.40
 Look.

596
5577.40 --> 5579.40
 It's touching.

597
5579.40 --> 5600.37
 It's touching.

598
5600.37 --> 5602.37
 Do you feel good?

599
5602.37 --> 5638.48
 Look.

600
5638.48 --> 5640.48
 I'll make you feel better.

601
5737.16 --> 5781.75
 What?

602
5781.75 --> 5785.12
 You left it there.

603
5813.96 --> 5825.08
 Let's go to the next one.

604
5827.08 --> 5829.08
 Look.

605
5829.08 --> 5834.44
 Pick it up.

606
5834.44 --> 5836.44
 You like it, don't you?

607
5836.44 --> 5838.44
 This medicine.

608
5864.21 --> 5869.83
 You're sleepy, aren't you?

609
5871.83 --> 5873.83
 You feel good, don't you?

610
5890.58 --> 5892.58
 You're crying a lot.

611
5916.64 --> 5924.88
 Do you feel good?

612
5924.88 --> 5937.99
 What's wrong?

613
5939.99 --> 5963.27
 You feel good, don't you?

614
5977.44 --> 5994.32
 You want to feel better, don't you?

615
5995.32 --> 5997.32
 Lift your butt.

616
6013.96 --> 6015.96
 Look.

617
6015.96 --> 6022.44
 What?

618
6022.44 --> 6035.74
 Look.

619
6035.74 --> 6037.74
 You're moving your ass a lot.

620
6037.74 --> 6067.07
 Are you okay?

621
6067.07 --> 6069.07
 You are lucky to get well soon.

622
6069.07 --> 6071.07
 You hit me again.

623
6072.07 --> 6073.07
 It's OK.

624
6073.07 --> 6075.07
 You'll feel better.

625
6112.32 --> 6115.92
 How do you feel?

626
6116.92 --> 6120.06
 Stand up.

627
6120.06 --> 6122.06
 Stand up and look at me.

628
6131.35 --> 6136.58
 I'm holding you tight.

629
6259.67 --> 6261.67
 You can't do it without shoes.

630
6270.70 --> 6272.70
 It's so cheap.

631
6281.57 --> 6283.57
 I'm holding you tight.

632
6294.46 --> 6302.34
 You're shaking.

633
6306.44 --> 6308.44
 You're so wet.

634
6310.44 --> 6311.44
 What are you going to do?

635
6405.49 --> 6410.79
 It's hot.

636
6411.79 --> 6413.79
 It's hot, isn't it?

637
6486.82 --> 6497.75
 You're amazing.

638
6497.75 --> 6499.75
 You're listening to everything.

639
6502.75 --> 6504.75
 You've always been erotic.

640
6505.75 --> 6506.75
 You're more erotic.

641
6506.75 --> 6508.75
 You're drooling.

642
6514.56 --> 6516.56
 You're drooling.

643
6519.93 --> 6527.28
 What's this drool?

644
6527.28 --> 6529.28
 This is a ginseng.

645
6533.23 --> 6535.23
 Do you want ginseng?

646
6536.23 --> 6538.23
 Where do you want it?

647
6538.23 --> 6546.47
 You like ginseng, don't you?

648
6547.47 --> 6549.47
 Do you want this?

649
6551.47 --> 6553.47
 It's delicious.

650
6557.16 --> 6559.16
 It's delicious.

651
6568.91 --> 6570.91
 Do you want it that much?

652
6592.15 --> 6595.15
 Do you want this before you put it in your mouth?

653
6597.15 --> 6598.15
 I want it.

654
6604.94 --> 6608.96
 Which one do you want?

655
6611.65 --> 6614.65
 The upper one or the lower one?

656
6615.65 --> 6617.65
 You're drooling.

657
6619.65 --> 6624.31
 You're drooling.

658
6625.31 --> 6630.67
 You're drooling.

659
6647.68 --> 6656.63
 You're shaking.

660
6663.80 --> 6665.80
 What are you doing?

661
6667.80 --> 6669.80
 Where is your boyfriend?

662
6670.80 --> 6675.80
 This woman and I need this medicine.

663
6676.80 --> 6679.80
 Don't mess with me.

664
6679.80 --> 6681.80
 Do you think I'll forgive you?

665
6682.80 --> 6684.80
 I don't care if you forgive me.

666
6685.80 --> 6688.80
 You're the man who sent me a message.

667
6690.80 --> 6692.80
 I'm very honored.

668
6705.76 --> 6707.76
 You're pathetic.

669
6708.76 --> 6710.76
 You can't protect a woman.

670
6711.76 --> 6713.76
 You know her true nature.

671
6714.76 --> 6716.76
 You two should make up.

672
6717.76 --> 6729.13
 Erika.

673
6735.22 --> 6737.22
 Erika.

674
6738.22 --> 6740.22
 Wake up.

675
6741.22 --> 6743.22
 Erika.

676
6744.22 --> 6747.22
 Why is he here?

677
6748.22 --> 6750.22
 Erika, answer me.

678
6751.22 --> 6753.22
 Why?

679
6753.22 --> 6757.79
 Why is he here?

680
6759.79 --> 6761.79
 What's going on?

681
6762.79 --> 6764.79
 Erika, are you okay?

682
6764.79 --> 6766.79
 Erika.

683
6766.79 --> 6768.79
 Erika.

684
6769.79 --> 6770.79
 Erika.

685
6770.79 --> 6784.12
 I'm sorry.

686
6785.12 --> 6787.12
 You don't have to apologize.

687
6788.12 --> 6790.12
 I understand the situation.

688
6791.12 --> 6795.12
 But I can't live without Erika.

689
6802.04 --> 6804.04
 No matter what happens.

690
6805.04 --> 6808.04
 We'll always be together.

691
6824.04 --> 6888.16
 Kenio.

692
6898.56 --> 6900.56
 I can't.

693
6922.55 --> 6924.55
 Kenio.

694
6933.03 --> 6950.48
 Kenio.

695
6950.48 --> 6952.48
 I'm glad you called me.

696
6953.48 --> 6955.48
 You can't live without me.

697
6958.63 --> 6959.63
 This medicine.

698
6960.63 --> 6962.63
 You can't live without this medicine.

699
6963.63 --> 6965.63
 You didn't like it at first.

700
6966.63 --> 6968.63
 I want it.

701
6969.63 --> 6971.63
 Do you want it?

702
6972.63 --> 6996.42
 Here it is.

703
6997.42 --> 6999.42
 Drink it yourself.

704
7004.29 --> 7010.48
 Drink it.

705
7017.79 --> 7019.79
 How is it?

706
7020.79 --> 7022.79
 I can't live without this medicine.

707
7023.79 --> 7025.79
 I can't live without it.

708
7052.12 --> 7053.12
 Look.

709
7054.12 --> 7057.12
 Sometimes I feel good.

710
7066.58 --> 7068.58
 I feel good.

711
7069.58 --> 7071.58
 I feel good.

712
7086.34 --> 7097.95
 You want to do it so much.

713
7101.95 --> 7124.72
 Take off your clothes.

714
7126.72 --> 7128.72
 Take off your clothes.

715
7158.81 --> 7160.81
 I want this.

716
7163.96 --> 7173.60
 Do you want this?

717
7213.06 --> 7222.90
 You want this, don't you?

718
7223.90 --> 7225.90
 You want this, don't you?

719
7241.77 --> 7243.77
 You want this, don't you?

720
7321.01 --> 7325.12
 What are you going to do?

721
7326.12 --> 7328.12
 Do you have anything to do before that?

722
7368.64 --> 7370.64
 I feel good.

723
7404.32 --> 7406.32
 I feel good.

724
7438.70 --> 7440.70
 Your right hand hurts, doesn't it?

725
7482.62 --> 7495.12
 Don't lick me.

726
7503.00 --> 7514.64
 Your butt is the best.

727
7522.04 --> 7524.04
 I feel good.

728
7568.72 --> 7570.72
 Don't lick me.

729
7608.20 --> 7615.29
 Do you want this?

730
7617.29 --> 7619.29
 I don't want it.

731
7641.26 --> 7668.03
 Do you feel good?

732
7669.03 --> 7671.03
 You feel good, don't you?

733
7671.03 --> 7683.40
 I feel good.

734
7695.34 --> 7705.12
 I feel good.

735
7772.47 --> 7774.47
 I feel good.

736
7861.92 --> 7863.92
 You want this, don't you?

737
7864.92 --> 7866.92
 You want this, don't you?

738
7899.66 --> 7929.60
 Do you feel good here?

739
7939.87 --> 7941.87
 You feel good because it's hot, don't you?

740
7982.26 --> 7992.61
 You feel good here.

741
7992.61 --> 7994.61
 You want this, don't you?

742
8029.15 --> 8034.96
 How do you want me to put this in?

743
8055.19 --> 8060.68
 What are you going to do?

744
8110.23 --> 8113.80
 You feel good, don't you?

745
8124.73 --> 8126.73
 Do you feel good here?

746
8127.73 --> 8157.86
 I feel good.

747
8212.90 --> 8214.90
 Spread your legs.

748
8327.81 --> 8329.81
 Do you feel good?

749
8334.02 --> 8339.70
 I feel good.

750
8408.06 --> 8410.06
 Do you still want to lick me?

751
8468.52 --> 8491.54
 I feel good.

752
8498.58 --> 8500.58
 I feel good.

753
8535.86 --> 8537.86
 I'm home.

754
8537.86 --> 8539.86
 I'm home.

755
8539.86 --> 8541.86
 I left the door open.

756
8541.86 --> 8548.44
 I left the door open.

757
8549.44 --> 8567.66
 Hello.

758
8581.29 --> 8583.29
 What are you doing now?

759
8585.29 --> 8589.31
 Don't mess with me.

760
8595.56 --> 8597.56
 Erika.

761
8597.56 --> 8599.56
 What's wrong with you, Erika?

762
8606.78 --> 8608.78
 You're playing with Erika.

763
8612.22 --> 8617.32
 No way.

764
8617.32 --> 8628.57
 Erika.

765
8628.57 --> 8630.57
 Don't mess with me.

766
8630.57 --> 8637.66
 No way.

767
8637.66 --> 8645.07
 No way.

768
8645.07 --> 8647.07
 What did you do?

769
8647.07 --> 8649.07
 Erika.

770
8649.07 --> 8651.07
 What did you do to Erika?
