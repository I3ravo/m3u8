1
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,700
It's been a long time since we had a date.

2
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I know.

3
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:22,656
What if my wife finds
out? No, it's okay.

4
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,500


5
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
My wife is in quarantine at home now.

6
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,800
So I came here with two people today.

7
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm looking forward to it.

8
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,080
Are you going somewhere?

9
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,561
Yes, the weather is good and I
want to go on a date in the city.

10
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,871
Have you been busy at the lounge?

11
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,580
I haven't been able
to shift at all recently.

12
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,971
I've been busy with school.

13
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,471
I'm going to graduate school next year.

14
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,500
Do you have a future?

15
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,581
Don't you have a boyfriend?

16
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,500
I haven't decided yet.

17
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,440
But I want to be with you.

18
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,770
Cool!

19
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Cool!

20
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Cool!

21
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,800
You don't come here,
do you? No, I don't.

22
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,050


23
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm happy that I'm special.

24
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
I'm so excited.

25
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,260
Everyone is watching us.

26
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Let's show them our love.

27
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,040
Everyone is watching us.

28
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,780
I'm so excited.

29
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,380
Because I dressed up too much.

30
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
That's right.

31
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Everyone is watching us.

32
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Everyone is watching us.

33
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm so excited.

34
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm so excited.

35
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm so excited.

36
00:04:59,401 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm so excited.

37
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,680
By the way,

38
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,580
I bought a lot of clothes for you.

39
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,581
Let's go to the beach!

40
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Do you want to buy it?

41
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Yes, I do!

42
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Do you have it?

43
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
Do you want it?

44
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,840
No, I'm looking for it.

45
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,440
Are you looking
for it? Yes, I am.

46
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,780


47
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,911
I'm happy to walk with such a nice man.

48
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,420
I'm happy to walk with such a nice man.

49
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm happy to walk with such a nice man.

50
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:28,841
Let's go to the beach!

51
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
Let's go!

52
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm looking forward to it.

53
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm looking forward to it, too.

54
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,520
What should I choose?

55
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,700
Which one do you want to see?

56
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,540
Which one do you want to see?

57
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,020
I like many things.

58
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
What do you like?

59
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
I like expensive things.

60
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:01,780
It's better to be high.

61
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,461
It's better to look at it from a distance.

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm getting excited.

63
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
Everyone is looking at it.

64
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,901
The people down there
are looking at it, too.

65
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,660
Look, they're looking at it.

66
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,440
I'm making it look good.

67
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm tall, so if I do this, I
won't be in the picture at all.

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,510
It's cute.

69
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,090
Do you have a favorite color
of clothes you always wear?

70
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,990
I don't know, but white is cute, too.

71
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:03,850
White looks good on you.

72
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,510
Cute.

73
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,610
Is it famous?

74
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,210
It's a famous one.

75
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,610
It's cute.

76
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,170
It's an acromium.

77
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,430
It's a gore-tex, so
it's suitable for fishing.

78
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,550
It's a gore-tex, so
it's suitable for fishing.

79
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:19,930
It's a gore-tex, so
it's suitable for fishing.

80
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,990
It's suitable for fishing.

81
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,990
There are many novel items.

82
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
There are a lot of items.

83
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,790
If you take off the back
zipper, you can wear it like this.

84
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,450
There is also a plastic part on the shoes.

85
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,390
You can customize it.

86
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,230
You know a lot.

87
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,710
I know.

88
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,210
I have something.

89
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,070
You know a lot.

90
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,500
What is this place?

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
What is this place?

92
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,540
What is this?

93
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,200
This is a synthetic dynamite.

94
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,580
Wow, it's amazing.

95
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,000
It's synthetic, so you can make it bigger.

96
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,840
It's good.

97
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,000
You can make it like this.

98
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:17,900
Can I make it like
this? Yes, you can.

99
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,380
It's flashy.

100
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,420


101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,740
Is it too flashy?

102
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,380
Is it too flashy? It's so cute.

103
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:34,340


104
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,950
Let's go to see the clothes.

105
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,530
Let's go to see the clothes..

106
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,030
Fukura,Fuku What?

107
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,990
Do you wanna buy some clothes?

108
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,930
Yes.

109
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,770
You look artistic.

110
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,970
You are amazing.

111
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,710
You are amazing.

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,930
It's amazing.

113
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,950
Look.

114
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,590
It's nice.

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
It's nice.

116
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
It's an undercarriage.

117
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:20,780
Is it a famous one? Yes, it is.

118
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,800


119
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,820
It's about 300,000 yen.

120
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
It's 270,000 yen.

121
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Right?

122
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,960
I was surprised.

123
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
But it's good.

124
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,740
Did you buy it? I bought it.

125
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,680


126
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
Thank you very much.

127
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,940
You're welcome.

128
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,020
It's okay.

129
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,680
It's cheap like this.

130
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,960
It's good.

131
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,640
It's small.

132
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,270
Thank you for the clothes.

133
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,570
I'm really happy.

134
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:21,650
We have arrived.

135
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,930
Leave the coffee to Yuma.

136
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,210
Really?

137
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:25,950
Let's eat something.

138
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,350
I got it.

139
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,230
I bought a set meal.

140
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,030
Thank you.

141
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,300
I'm going to feed you.

142
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,000
Are you going to
eat it? Here you are.

143
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
It's delicious.

144
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,040


145
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,660
It's hard for you.

146
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,820
You got on my back.

147
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
I got on your back.

148
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,740
Be careful.

149
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,280
Your hands are dirty.

150
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,210
Do you want me to wipe your hands?

151
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,900
Do you want me to wipe your hands?

152
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,020
Do you want me to wipe your hands?

153
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,660
Do you want me to wipe
your hands? Let's go.

154
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760


155
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
What? What's up?

156
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
What?

157
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,870
What?

158
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,260
Someone is watching us.

159
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,890
No one is here.

160
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,240
Don't you get excited in such a place?

161
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,760
I do get excited,
but... Wait a minute.

162
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
It's open.

163
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,180
What's up?

164
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:40,181
What are you going
to do? It's nostalgic.

165
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300


166
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,510
I can't stand it.

167
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,150
Do you want to go to a
parking lot nearby? Yes, I do.

168
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,530
Let's go.

169
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:02,770
Thank you.

170
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,430


171
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,050
I'm going to put on a seat belt.

172
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,070
It was really hard, wasn't it?

173
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,590
It was hard, wasn't it?

174
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,050
It was hard, wasn't it?

175
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,950
Are you filming? Yes, I am.

176
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,350


177
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,470
Oh, you are filming.

178
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,310
Are you going to
wear it? Yes, I am.

179
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,550


180
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,160
You don't want to wear it, do you?

181
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,166
You are going to wear it, aren't you?

182
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,670
You are going to wear it, aren't you?

183
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,260
We arrived at the campsite.

184
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,300
We arrived at the campsite.

185
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,320
We arrived at the campsite.

186
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,140
I think it's safe here.

187
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,560
I think it's safe here.

188
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,561
I think it's safe here.

189
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:03,510
Are you sure? I'm sure.

190
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,870


191
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
What is it?

192
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:14,840
Do you want me to touch your knee?

193
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,470
You are so naughty.

194
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,970
You get excited when I touch
your knee, don't you? Yes, I do.

195
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,570


196
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,390
I'm not a wife, am
I? No, you're not.

197
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,530
You're so calm.

198
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,390
Oh, no.

199
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,710
What's wrong? I feel sick.

200
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,470


201
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:16,260
I want to sleep.

202
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Do you want to sleep?

203
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Yes.

204
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,740
What are you doing?

205
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,780
I'm going to look up what's going on.

206
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,640
It's getting bigger and bigger.

207
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:31,060
It's getting bigger and bigger.

208
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,140
It feels good.

209
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,590
It looks like it's going
to last a long time.

210
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,440
It's full.

211
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,070
Is it full?

212
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,820
Yes.

213
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,820
OK.

214
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Please do it properly.

215
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
OK.

216
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Look!

217
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Look!

218
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Wow! Wow! I know.

219
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,500


220
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,260


221
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,220
You are serious.

222
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,880
Why?

223
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,500
Are you excited about this place?

224
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,130
What are you looking at?

225
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,950
What are you looking at?

226
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,970
What are you looking at?

227
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:52,435
Let's take it out for now.

228
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,510
I'm nervous.

229
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,460
Oh, you're ticklish.

230
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:06,010
I can hear a baby crying.

231
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,310
But it's a baby's voice,
so I can't tell his name.

232
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,750
This baby's voice is so cute.

233
00:21:41,395 --> 00:22:45,960
I'm going to give him a painkiller.

234
00:22:46,765 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm going to give him a painkiller.

235
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,490
I'm hungry.

236
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,950
I'm going crazy.

237
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,670
Wait a minute.

238
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,020
I feel so good.

239
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm tired.

240
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm ticklish.

241
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,550
I'm tired.

242
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:18,551
I'm so tired.

243
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
What are you doing?

244
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Did you drink a
lot? No, I didn't.

245
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,040


246
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:38,860
Shall we go inside?

247
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Yes, let's go inside.

248
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,500
Let's go to the hotel.

249
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,740
It's dangerous.

250
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,200
Please wear your clothes properly.

251
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,060
I'll wear my clothes properly.

252
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Is my clothes
okay? Yes, it's okay.

253
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480


254
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:36,160
The cat took a nap on
the sofa and came to me.

255
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:37,340
You know what I do?

256
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,740
You know what kind of fuck it is.

257
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
Watch.

258
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,870
Good girl.

259
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:58,160
This is the first time
I've ever had a baby.

260
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,080
It's been a long time
since I've had a baby.

261
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,620
It's been a long time
since I've had a baby.

262
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,740
It's been a long time
since I've had a baby.

263
00:30:37,370 --> 00:31:12,086
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

264
00:31:47,270 --> 00:32:49,670
I can't help but laugh when
I see my daughter's face.

265
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,570
I'm going to sleep.

266
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,190
I'm going to sleep.

267
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:04,100
I'm going to sleep.

268
00:33:51,580 --> 00:36:02,640
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

269
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,580
I'm sorry.

270
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:04,581
I'm sorry.

271
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm sorry.

272
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm sorry.

273
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,770
I'm sorry.

274
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,490
I'm sorry.

275
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,310
I'm sorry.

276
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:07,060
I will show my mother's reaction
when he was in the hospital.

277
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,040
He is a mother of three children.

278
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,340
She is a mother of 6 children.

279
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,560
She is a mother of 2 children.

280
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,040
She is a mother of 3 children.

281
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,241
She is a mother of 2 children.

282
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,190
I'm so sorry.

283
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,060
I'm so sorry.

284
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:16,061
You're bleeding a lot.

285
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:47,880
Let me see your legs.

286
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,560
You're bleeding a lot.

287
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,990
Oh, I see.

288
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,740
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

289
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:46,706
This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

290
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:27,500
I'm sorry, I'm going to do it again.

291
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,060
I'm sorry, I'm going to do it again.

292
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:56,740
I'm sorry, I'm going to do it again.

293
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,260
I'm sorry, I'm going to do it again.

294
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
Wow!

295
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,170
Can you lie down on my lap?

296
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,340
There are still some parts
that are not completely healed.

297
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:37,341
I've just been here.

298
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,210
It's a big deal.

299
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,020
Oh my god.

300
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,360
Oh my god.

301
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:04,361
I'm sorry.

302
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,740
My head hurts.

303
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,240
Let's go.

305
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,140
I'm so sorry.

306
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,360
I'm hungry.

307
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,480
Are you hungry? I'm hungry.

308
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880


309
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,980
I just ate yakitori.

310
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,340
Shall we make a reservation?

311
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,800
Shall we?

312
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:09,801
Yes.

313
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,800
I made a reservation.

314
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,700
How is it? It's good.

315
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,780


316
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,701
The night view is beautiful, isn't it?

317
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,356
The night view outside the building.

318
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,820
The night view outside the building.

319
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,400
The night view outside the building.

320
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,580
It's beautiful, isn't it?

321
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,540
It's fashionable.

322
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,720
It's more fashionable inside than outside.

323
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,020
I think so.

324
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,001
I didn't know there was such a place.

325
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,050
It's a good place to see.

326
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,550
I think so, too.

327
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:04,110
I'll take a lot of pictures.

328
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,760
Thank you.

329
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,860
Pasta is here.

330
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,850
How is it?

331
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,890
Is it good? It's good.

332
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,950
It's good.

333
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,730
Let's eat.

334
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,490
Let's eat.

335
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,650
Let's eat.

336
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,690


337
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,540
You didn't call your wife?

338
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,410
She was here a while ago.

339
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,100
I ignored her.

340
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,640
Let's take a picture.

341
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:07,695
Because it's a memory.

342
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,950
Cheers!

343
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,810
Delicious!

344
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:32,030
Isn't this expensive?

345
00:56:32,031 --> 00:56:32,330
What is this?

346
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:33,970
Isn't it delicious?
It's precious.

347
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,210


348
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,610
It's too precious.

349
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,830
It's the best, isn't it?

350
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,010
Are you ignoring me?

351
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,310
I'm ignoring you.

352
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,430
Look at this side only.

353
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,050
Yuma-chan.

354
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,470
I only look at Yuma-chan.

355
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,350
I'm happy.

356
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,546
Do you want me to give you a potato?

357
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,570
Are you OK?

358
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:00,590
How is it?

359
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,570
I don't have a spoon.

360
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:05,970
You don't have a spoon.

361
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:07,530
I'll take it for you.

362
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,210
It's too wild.

363
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,550
It's too wild, isn't
it? It's too wild.

364
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:14,750


365
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:15,850
Don't you need
this much? I need it.

366
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,170
Here you are.

367
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,570
Thank you.

368
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:27,900
How does it taste?

369
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,380
Wow, it's good!

370
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:34,810
It's good, isn't
it? Yes, it's good.

371
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:35,910


372
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:37,850
I'll give you a lot.

373
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,590
Oh, thank you.

374
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,690
You're kind.

375
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,790
I'm kind.

376
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,010
Because I like you.

377
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:45,510
I'll give you a lot.

378
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:51,530
How is it? It's good.

379
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,110


380
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,590
Is it good?

381
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:53,591
Is it good?

382
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,950
This is a meaty meat.

383
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,370
It's good.

384
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,370
It's a rice cracker pineapple.

385
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,991
It's a dried fruit, isn't it?

386
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,690
It's a rice cracker.

387
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,290
How is it?

388
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,370
It's not alcohol.

389
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:19,371
It's not a snack.

390
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:20,390
Seriously?

391
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,170
Maybe it's not a snack.

392
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,510
It's not a snack.

393
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:24,690
It's a Senbei.

394
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,050
It's a Senbei.

395
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,310
It's a Senbei.

396
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:28,351
It was a pineapple Senbei.

397
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,730
But it's good.

398
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,230
It's rich.

399
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,830
It seems like candy.

400
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,150
It seems like candy.

401
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:37,930
I think so.

402
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,170
It was like that.

403
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:41,870
It's good.

404
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,070
It's broken.

405
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,470
Oh, it was broken.

406
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,830
I'll give it to you.

407
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:51,930
How does it taste? It's good.

408
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,530


409
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:59,190
I thought it would be good, but I forgot to
eat it, so I'll give it to you next time.

410
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,110
It's good, isn't
it? This is good.

411
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,790
Thank you.

412
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,130
It's fun.

413
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,470
It's good.

414
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,170


415
00:59:18,665 --> 00:59:20,666
Do you think you can
do a lot of things like this?

416
00:59:22,385 --> 00:59:24,480
I don't think so.

417
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,160
I want to be with you.

418
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:35,200
I'm trying to make time, but I'm
always sorry that I feel that way.

419
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,780
No, it's okay. I can do a lot of
things, and it's convenient to go home.

420
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,360
It's easy.

421
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
I see.

422
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,340
I have to make more time.

423
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,160
I'm glad.

424
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,900
Are you full?

425
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,360
Yes.

426
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,040
Let's go.

427
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,730
Let's go back to the room.

428
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,210
What are you going to do?

429
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:29,910
I'm looking forward to it.

430
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,390
Let's go.

431
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,540
Was it delicious? Yes, it was.

432
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,820


433
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,121
Here, here, it's good,
isn't it? I think so.

434
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:51,320


435
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,470
I think it's good.

436
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,960
Look at this.

437
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,820
This is the place.

438
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,600
This is a photo of our second anniversary.

439
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:02,281
This is a photo of our second anniversary.

440
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,380
It's good.

441
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,660
It's good.

442
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:12,620
It's good.

443
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,020
It's strong.

444
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,180
It's strong.

445
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:21,340
It's good.

446
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,740
Let's exchange.

447
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:22,880
Let's go.

448
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,720
Do you want to
kiss? Strong wind.

449
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,280


450
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,760
Let's climb a little more.

451
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,340
Let's go.

452
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:50,170
Welcome.

453
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,950
Please take a seat here.

454
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,600
Highball? Highball.

455
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,561
Let's have one cup of oil.

456
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,200
I'd like a 12-year-old Seabass, please.

457
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,340
Yes, sir.

458
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,580
Please wait a moment.

459
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,040
It's a drug, isn't it?

460
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,180
Yes.

461
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:14,181
It's a drug.

462
01:02:16,305 --> 01:02:17,760
Do you drink it? Sometimes.

463
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,100
Excuse me.

464
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,360
You're fast.

465
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:22,840


466
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
Seabass is fast.

467
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,860
Here's your highball.

468
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,060
Thank you.

469
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,180
Excuse me.

470
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:29,940
Cheers.

471
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,850
It's good, isn't it?

472
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,250
It's good, isn't it?

473
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,430
It's good, isn't it?

474
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,130
Don't you need water? I'm fine.

475
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:48,930


476
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:49,930
Really?

477
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,250
I don't want to get drunk.

478
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,130
You drink a lot.

479
01:02:54,835 --> 01:02:56,330
I drink a lot.

480
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,900
I know.

481
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,160
I drink a lot.

482
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,220
Are you okay?

483
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,700
I think you drank too much.

484
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,220
You're drinking water.

485
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:10,221
He is drinking water.

486
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,570
Are you drunk? Yes, I am.

487
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,250


488
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,630
What?

489
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:30,890
You will be found out.

490
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,450
You do that, don't you?

491
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,610
I'm going to use it.

492
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,610
Be quiet.

493
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:09,250
Does it feel good?

494
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,830
You're not here,
are you? I'm fine.

495
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,070


496
01:04:53,815 --> 01:04:54,850
You have a lot of hair.

497
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,460
You have a lot of hair.

498
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,460
Are you ready?

499
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,100
Yes.

500
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,620
Are you ready? I'm sorry.

501
01:05:30,345 --> 01:05:37,810
I'm sorry.

502
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:38,811
I'm sorry.

503
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,890
I'm sorry.

504
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,810
I'm sorry.

505
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,850
I'm sorry.

506
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,070


507
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,940
You are so cute.

508
01:06:26,845 --> 01:06:28,060
You are so cute.

509
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,900
You are amazing.

510
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,000
You are so close to me.

511
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:45,500
You are amazing.

512
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm sorry, I can't.

513
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,920
I'm sorry, I can't.

514
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,420
Why?

515
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,080
I'm sorry, I can't.

516
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,960
Why?

517
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,480
I want to see you.

518
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,360
No, I can't.

519
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,160
You're amazing.

520
01:07:11,345 --> 01:07:12,660
You're amazing.

521
01:07:48,000 --> 01:08:04,240
Welcome to Miracle Morning!

It's embarrassing.

525
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,740
You're amazing.

526
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,780
You're standing up so well.

527
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,841
You don't look tired at all.

528
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,880
Hey.

529
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,020
You did a good job.

530
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,080
Can I pet you?

531
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,660
What are you doing?

532
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:43,661
What's wrong?

533
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:50,560
I'm going to put milk in the glass.

534
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,740
Hey, I was waiting for you.

535
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,680
Hey.

536
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,620
You were groaning.

537
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:59,760
Were you excited? Yes, I was.

538
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,620


539
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,260
You are drooling.

540
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,300
You are drooling a lot.

541
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,700
I'm going to take a nap.

542
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Are you sleepy?

543
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,540
Did you want to sleep?

544
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:11,820
Are you sleepy?

545
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,580

Do you feel good? That's great.

01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:13,251
You're eating a lot.

550
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:58,640
It's good, isn't it?

551
01:12:58,641 --> 01:12:59,641
Do you want some
more? What? Good boy.

552
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,050


553
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,880


554
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,620

Do you feel a tightness
on your head? Yes, I do.

565
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,080


566
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,740
I'm going to sleep.

567
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:11,530

I'm going to sleep.

572
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,180
I'm sorry.

573
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:38,360
It's so good.

574
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,140
It's a soup.

575
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:45,900
It's so good.

576

It's so good.

579
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:33,740
I like the sound of my dad's
voice when he's in sleep.

580
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:34,340
He's always like this when he wakes up.

581
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:41,220
He's always like this, always.

582
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,320
I want to be like him.

583
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:45,520
I love you.

You're so cute, Shin-chan.

595
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,650
Are you okay?

596
01:20:00,265 --> 01:20:01,306
Let's make a lot of money.

597
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:05,270
Me?

598
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:13,630
Is it all right? Let me see.

599
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:33,460
Let me see.

600
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,461
It hurts.

601
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,240


602
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,480
Do you want it?

603
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:57,600
You got a pimple.

604
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,380
You got a pimple.

605
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,440
Look at this.

01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:09,860
I got a lot of pimples.

607
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,900
A lot of pimples?

608
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:16,830
I have to buy you new clothes.

609
01:21:29,495 --> 01:21:34,960
Are you tired?

610
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,900
I'm a little nervous.

611
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:39,540
I want you to be nervous.

612
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,380
Touch my belly.

I want to touch you.

622
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,360
I want to touch you.

623
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,520
Let's go.

Do you want to go
home? Yes, I do.

632

Can't you see
anything? No, I can't.

642
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,530


643
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,110
I heard someone's coming.

644
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:56,370
I can't see.

645
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,810

646
01:23:57,811 --> 01:23:58,811

It's hot.

660

Give me your hand.

661
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:55,021
It feels good, doesn't it?

662

It feels good, doesn't it?

665
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,000
You have a lot of hair on your head.

666
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,020
Do you want more?

667
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,600
Do you want more?

668
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,880
Do you want more?

669
01:27:15,735 --> 01:27:19,260
It's been a long time since I've
had a baby, so I'm a little nervous.

670
01:27:19,261 --> 01:27:19,420
I'm going to have a baby
soon, so I'm a little nervous.

671
01:27:19,421 --> 01:27:21,621

675
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,400
What? What? I don't know.

676
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,940


677
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:09,340

You are in my way.

680
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:14,600
Are you scared? No, I'm not.

681
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,100
Are you sure? I'm sure.

01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,080


683
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:24,980
I'm going to give you a kiss.

684
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:58,200
I'm going to give you a kiss.

685
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:50,440
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

686
01:29:50,441 --> 01:29:50,460
It's been a long time since
I've seen a cat like this.

687
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:52,621
It's been a long time since
I've seen a cat like this.

688
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,960
I'm sorry.

689
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,460
It's hot.

690
01:29:58,461 --> 01:29:59,461
Where is it?

691
01:30:49,080 --> 01:31:05,580
I'm going to take off my panties.

692
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,420
I'm going to take off my panties.

693
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,260
I'm going to take off my panties.

694
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:39,270
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

695
01:32:01,815 --> 01:32:03,530
I'm not sure if it's because I've
never seen a cat like this before,

696
01:32:03,531 --> 01:32:05,096
I'm not sure if it's because
I've never seen a cat like

697
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:21,440
this before, but I've never
seen a cat like this before.

698
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,780
What?

699
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:16,850
Do you want me to kiss you?

700
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:18,590
I don't know how to kiss you.

701
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:19,990
Do you want me to
kiss you? It feels good.

702
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,220
It feels good.

703
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,900


704
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:17,570
This is the first time
I've ever seen a baby cry.

705
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:17,590
I'm so sorry.

706
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:19,410
I'm so sorry.

707
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:36,340
I'm so sorry.

708
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:42,880
It's embarrassing.

709
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,300
It's embarrassing.

710
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:55,880
It's so bright.

711
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
It's embarrassing.

712
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,780
It's so good.

713
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:49,020
It feels good.

714
01:36:49,021 --> 01:36:50,021
It feels good.

715
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,070
Oh, it's so itchy.

716
01:37:04,815 --> 01:37:07,670
Oh, no.

717
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:12,200
It's so painful.

718
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:25,980
No, no, it's not painful.

719
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,340
You can't do it anymore?

720
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,320
I want to do it more.

721
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,480
Do you want to do it more?

722
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:46,340
I want to do it more.

723
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:52,836
You wanted to do it more, didn't you?

724
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:53,981
Yes, I wanted to do it more.

725
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:40,101
I don't know what I'm doing.

726
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,160
I don't know what I'm doing.

727
01:40:01,055 --> 01:40:02,640
I don't know what I'm doing.

728
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,510
I don't know what I'm doing.

729
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,320
I don't know what I'm doing.

730
01:40:39,321 --> 01:40:40,740
I don't know what I'm doing.

731
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:55,350
I don't know what I'm doing.

732
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:56,790
I don't know what I'm doing.

733
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,140
I don't know what I'm doing.

734
01:41:06,141 --> 01:41:06,280
I don't know what I'm doing.

735
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:06,440
I don't know what I'm doing.

736
01:41:06,441 --> 01:41:07,561
I don't know what I'm doing.

737
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,600
I've been sick of it.

738
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,140
You're sick? Yes, I'm sick.

739
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:30,120


740
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,020
Did you go to the
hospital again? Yes, I did.

741
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,300


742
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,090
Did you go to the
hospital? Yes, I did.

743
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,790
Did you get a fever? Yes, I did.

744
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:45,350


745
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:47,111
I want to go to the bathroom.

746
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,861
I can't go to the bathroom.

747
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:56,010
I can't go to the bathroom.

748
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,120
I feel sick.

749
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:33,020
I'm so happy.

750
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,280
I'm so happy.

751
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:45,200
I'm so happy.

752
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:49,440
I'm so happy.

753
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:54,950
I'm going to give birth to a baby.

754
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,760
I'm sorry.

755
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:36,920
I'm sorry.

756
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:37,080
I'm sorry.

757
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:38,920
I'm sorry.

758
01:44:47,445 --> 01:44:53,480
I'm sorry.

759
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,120
Oh, my God!

760
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:29,980
Oh, my God!

761
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:34,930
Oh, my God!

762
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,200
Oh, my God!

763
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:02,160
She seems to have put a pyramid.

764
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:06,770
I can't breathe.

765
01:46:46,660 --> 01:47:43,130
I can't breathe.

766
01:47:46,440 --> 01:48:52,380
I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it
anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it

767
01:48:52,392 --> 01:49:59,450
anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do
it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore, I can't do

768
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:24,520
I'm so happy that I can't
even speak properly.

769
01:50:53,800 --> 01:51:14,870
I'm not used to this, so
I can't speak properly.

770
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:36,920
Mom, I want to go to the bathroom.

771
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:52,170
I want to go to the bathroom.

772

01:52:55,231 --> 01:52:56,391
I want to go to the bathroom.

776
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:42,580
I want to go to the bathroom.

777
01:53:42,581 --> 01:53:43,741
I want to go to the bathroom.

778
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,760

01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,120


784
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,140
I won't bother you.

785
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,540
I just want you to be patient.
