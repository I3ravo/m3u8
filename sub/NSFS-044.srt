1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,892
It's been a long time
since I've been here, so I'm

2
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:18,800
going to show you a little
bit of my house cleaning.

3
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,430
It's pretty dirty, isn't it?

4
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,020
It's a little rotten.

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:51,940
I was a salaryman until two years ago.

6
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,747
I was tired of working
at a company, so I

7
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,920
opened a house cleaning
company two years ago.

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,360
Now, I've been getting requests
from big companies like this.

9
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,565
I'm not as stable as
I was when I was a

10
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:08,640
salaried worker, but my
income has increased.

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,320
The more I work hard,
the more I get into myself.

12
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,400
But I can do this because
I have my wife's support.

13
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,401
It's because of her.

14
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,520
Even when I quit my job, she
never complained and supported me.

15
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,700
And even today, she
helps me when I'm alone.

16
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,590
She's a good woman who I feel sorry for.

17
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,681
That's why I can do my best for Shihori.

18
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Can I put this on?

19
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,870
Yes, please.

20
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
You must be tired.

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,530
You must be tired.

22
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,470
Thank you so much.

23
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,810
Thank you for your sudden visit.

24
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,370
Thank you.

25
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,950
Can I have your autograph here?

26
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,590
Sure.

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,210
I'm glad you did a good job.

28
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,010
I hope to see you again.

29
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,970
Thank you so much.

30
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,350
The back door is open.

31
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:24,690
Thank you for your hard work.

32
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,290
Thank you for your hard work.

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,750
I'm glad.

34
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,870
Thank you.

35
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,960
The staff here is very nice.

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
That's right.

37
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,400
They are very helpful.

38
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,400
They give me a lot of work.

39
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
Let's do our best.

40
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,560
Okay, I'll take this.

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,800
Here you are.

42
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,660
Thank you.

43
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Don't drink too much.

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I know.

45
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,560
But a drink before work is the best.

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Do you want some more?

47
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
Yes, please.

48
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
It's delicious.

49
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,966
The omelette looks delicious today.

50
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,840
Yes, I worked hard to make it.

51
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,380
Is it delicious?

52
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:37,540
Is it good?

53
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
It's good.

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,680
I'm glad.

55
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
It goes well with alcohol.

56
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,950
But I'm glad.

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
About what?

58
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,911
When I was working at the company,

59
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,410
you always looked tired.

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Really?

61
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Yes.

62
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Then,

63
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,956
what kind of face did you have?

64
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,960
Like this.

65
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,820
You don't look like that.

66
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,931
What else did you look like?

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Like this.

68
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,110
You don't look like that.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,340
You are really cute.

70
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,840
You don't look like that.

71
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,060
What's wrong?

72
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,061
What's wrong with you?

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey, I'm doing this because of you.

74
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
You're exaggerating.

75
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
I'm not exaggerating.

76
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Let's go to bed.

77
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,800
No.

78
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,740
Why?

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,320
I have to clean up.

80
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
You can do it later.

81
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:48,980
No.

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Why?

83
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,510
Let's go to bed.

84
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,200
If I do it now, a drunk child will be born.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
There is no such thing.

86
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,500
Why are you acting like a drunk kid?

87
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,380
Let's go to bed.

88
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,000
No.

89
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,680
Please.

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,520
What?

91
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,130
Please.

92
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
No.

93
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,190
I'll eat it later.

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,380
What?

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,241
It's freshly made and delicious.

96
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,380
Yes, but it's delicious even
if you eat it when it's made.

97
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,920
I made it, so eat it.

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,460
No, I'll eat it later.

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Now.

100
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,060
I want to go to bed now.

101
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,400
Please, please, please.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
No.

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,220
Why?

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Let's eat.

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I'm going to eat.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Are you going to eat now?

107
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,580
I'm going to eat.

108
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,581
Are you going to eat?

109
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,320
I'm not going to eat.

110
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,756
You just said you were going to eat.

111
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,260
I'm going to eat shihori.

112
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,180
No.

113
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
Are you going to eat rice?

114
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,640
I'm going to eat it later.

115
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Please.

116
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm going to pack more and more.

117
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
I didn't have this.

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,180
Is that so?

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I think I have it.

120
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,780
I'll pack more.

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,780
Thank you.

122
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
It's getting smaller.

123
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,720
That's right.

124
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:33,640
There are a lot of places I haven't
been to, so I'm going to look around again.

125
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,240
If you find anything, let me know.

126
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,781
I'm going to clean up a little later.

127
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,340
It's all over the place.

128
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,070
What's wrong?

129
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Mr. Yokoyama.

130
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,590
Kotoin.

131
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,530
What are you doing here?

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,040
It's delicious.

133
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,340
It's been a while since I
had such a delicious meal.

134
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,320
Thank you.

135
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,400
Thank you for cooking for me.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No problem.

137
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,460
But... What happened to you?

138
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,251
If you don't want to tell me...
You don't have to tell me.

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,270
Actually, my wife and children ran away.

140
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:21,930
I was fired from my job
and I couldn't pay the rent.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,190
I had a friend who hired
me, but he fired me too.

142
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,610
Do you have a job now?

143
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,130
No, I don't.

144
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,050
I was fired after you quit your job.

145
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:42,250
I got fired after that.

146
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,970
Is that so?

147
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,530
I quit my job and became a drunkard.

148
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,810
My wife took my kid and ran away.

149
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,050
But...

150
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,550
I didn't think I'd be called out there.

151
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,850
I miss it.

152
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
When I was working with Kotori.

153
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
It was good back then.

154
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,670
You're right.

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,890
Do you drink?

156
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,410
No, I quit drinking.

157
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,010
To get serious.

158
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,250
But it's ironic.

159
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,210
When I got serious, everything was gone.

160
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,750
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
It's a little stained.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,320
It's too late today, so please stay.

164
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
What?

165
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Is it okay, Shiori?

166
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Thank you.

167
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,020
Please eat a lot.

168
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
This is really delicious.

169
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,310
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

170
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,970
No, you were a senior at the
company you worked for, weren't you?

171
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,330
Mr. Yokoyama.

172
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,370
Yeah.

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,490
I heard a rumor, but I heard that
you were late for a drinking party.

174
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,990
So I couldn't quit drinking
because of my family.

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,590
I'm a good person, but when I drink,

176
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:06,950
I'm sure you're tired of
being late and drinking again.

177
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,170
It's hard to find a job, isn't it?

178
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,210
I think so.

179
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:18,430
But you used to be a brilliant senior.

180
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,050
So I want you to go back to your old self.

181
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,590
I hope you find a job.

182
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,240
Let's go to bed. It's early in the morning.

183
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,610
Good night.

184
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,090
Good night.

185
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,470
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,770
I didn't bring you breakfast.

187
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,850
It's okay.

188
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,750
If you eat this, I'll leave.

189
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,950
I'll definitely give it back to you.

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,610
Um, senpai.

191
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,310
I know what you're talking about.

192
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:24,080
How much do you have now?

193
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,320
About 1,000 yen.

194
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,920
I see.

195
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,960
I talked to my wife.

196
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,400
If you don't mind, would
you like to work at my house?

197
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
What?

198
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,380
I have a child's room
for when I have a baby.

199
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,500
I'd like you to live and work there.

200
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,240
It's a tough job, but is it okay?

201
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,960
It's not easy to get a job.

202
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,900
Senpai.

203
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,100
Thank you.

204
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,820
Thank you so much.

205
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,920
I'm sorry. Thank you so much.

206
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
Don't mention it.

207
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
Thank you!

208
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,260
Thank you so much.

209
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,060
Hey, senpai.

210
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,700
You saved me.

211
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Don't lower your head.

212
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,360
It's okay.

214
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,900
Thank you so much.

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,300
Don't mention it.

216
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,500
Thank you so much.

217
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,790
Senpai, don't lower your head.

218
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:32,960
Senpai.

220
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,200
Let's eat.

222
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
It's okay.

223
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,700
I'll never forget this.

224
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,560
Don't mention it.

225
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Thank you.

226
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,180
Thank you so much.

227
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:44,700
Open your mouth. Let's eat.

228
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Thank you.

229
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:59,290
Thank you.

230
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,090
But promise me that you won't
drink alcohol except on holidays.

231
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,730
I won't drink alcohol
for the rest of my life.

232
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,230
Don't say the rest of your life.

233
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,610
If people don't bother you at
work, you don't have to drink at all.

234
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,510
I won't drink.

235
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,511
Are you okay?

236
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,270
You're not going to drink, are you?

237
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Let's eat first.

238
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,850
Thank you.

239
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,911
My dad told me not to
trust people who easily

240
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:41,940
lower their heads or
cry in front of people.

241
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:49,060
But at this time, I had completely
forgotten my father's words.

242
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,490
Are you okay?

243
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,310
Yeah.

244
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Excuse me.

245
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:35,835
Can you be a little more careful?

246
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
A little stronger.

248
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,860
Oh, the corner there.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Yes, the corner.

250
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,760
Are you okay?

251
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,780
I'm fine, I'm fine.

252
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Yes, please.

253
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,970
Hey, I'm done here.

254
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,150
Then can you bring me a wax from the car?

255
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,890
Oh, sure.

256
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,170
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,790
Please.

258
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,270
It's so cheap, I can't do such a hard job.

259
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,790
This is my room.

260
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,770
It's like a monologue. Are you okay?

261
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,110
I'm fine. Thank you.

262
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,470
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,690
I think this bed and table can be used.

264
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,280
Please use it as you like.

265
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,330
Thank you very much.

266
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,950
It seems that dinner is ready.
Do you want to eat together?

267
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,370
Oh, I'm sorry.

268
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:40,120
Please have a seat.

269
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,960
It looks delicious.

270
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:52,220
It smells good.

271
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,980
Let's eat.

272
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Let's eat.

273
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:12,980
It's delicious.

274
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:13,200
It's good.

275
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,096
It's different from the usual one.

276
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
It's very rich.

277
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,560
I like this one.

278
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
You're full of energy.

279
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,730
How is it?

280
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
It's the best.

281
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,200
There's so much meat in it.

282
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,520
It's good.

283
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
It's good.

284
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
It's good.

285
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
This is for you.

286
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
Thank you.

287
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
It's good.

288
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,420
Were you busy at the hospital?

289
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,840
No, I was at home.

290
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
That's good.

291
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
I was only at home.

292
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
I see.

293
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
What's this?

294
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,001
Oh, this is... sleeping pills.

295
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
You drink that much?

296
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,800
It's not just you who's stressed out.

297
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,820
That's true.

298
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,160
Everyone gets stressed out, right?

299
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,820
Yes.

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I see.

301
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,180
So, do you take it often?

302
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,530
It's a medicine.

303
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
I can't get up even if I shake it.

304
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,880
Is that so?

305
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Yes.

306
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,300
I was scared when I was
alone, but now I have Shihori.

307
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,860
Oh, I see.

308
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Yes.

309
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,920
By the way, what was
the fire extinguisher today?

310
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,320
Oh, maybe the employees
were hiding and inhaling.

311
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,900
Oh, but we're in
trouble if we're told that.

312
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
That's right.

313
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Yes.

314
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,160
Where was the fire extinguisher?

315
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Toilet.

316
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,430
Toilet?

317
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
There was a water stain.

318
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,680
I see.

319
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,980
I don't have good manners.

320
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
You're right.

321
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
That's a violation of manners.

322
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
You can't do that.

323
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,740
If you kiss me, I can't calm down.

324
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,680
You're right.

325
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,320
I can't forgive you.

326
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
I can't forgive you.

327
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,540
The curry is getting cold.

328
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,741
It's very delicious, isn't it?

329
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
It's very delicious.

330
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I'm glad.

331
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,370
How is it?

332
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,670
The meat is tender and delicious.

333
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,670
You are good at cooking.

334
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,210
I'm glad.

335
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,190
Please eat a lot.

336
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,890
Is it okay?

337
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,470
Yes.

338
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,490
I'm so happy that you complimented me.

339
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,970
Really? I'm so happy.

340
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,050
I'm so happy.

341
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,030
Can I have another one?

342
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:02,970
What?

343
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,110
Can I have another one?

344
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,790
Sure.

345
00:24:39,360 --> 00:26:19,800
You're late.

346
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,360
Can you wake me up?

347
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,920
Okay.

348
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,600
I'm sorry.

349
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:25,601
Yes.

350
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,570
Takayama-San, it's morning.

351
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Yes.

352
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm sorry.

353
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I overslept.

354
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,450
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,420
I'll get off soon.

356
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Is Senpai awake?

358
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,030
I wonder what happened.

359
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:50,930
What's wrong?

360
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Nothing.

361
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,390
I see.

362
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,380
Hey, listen to me before
you take the medicine.

363
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
What's wrong?

364
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,465
Are you withdrawing money from your wallet?

365
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,850
I can't do that.

366
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,400
You're right.

367
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,300
What's wrong?

368
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,760
I don't have enough
30,000 yen for the payment.

369
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:30,920
It's not a mistake, is it?

370
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
I did it many times.

371
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:36,861
And... And what?

372
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,700
In Yokoyama's room, there were
a bottle of sake and a cigarette.

373
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,240
You did it when you were drunk, didn't you?

374
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:49,420
But the deposit is only 1,000 yen.

375
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,290
I can buy something like this.

376
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,810
Do you say you stole it?

377
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,940
I don't know.

378
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:57,280
I'm not going to do that.

379
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:58,321
You don't have to do that.

380
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,181
But... No.

381
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,840
It's okay.

382
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,380
Let's go to bed.

383
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Good night.

384
00:31:05,520 --> 00:32:17,240
Mr. Yokoyama?

385
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:18,241
Mr. Nishimura?

386
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,900
No, it's not like that.

387
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,040
No, it's not like that.

388
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,740
I've done so much for you.

389
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,400
Why are you doing this?

390
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,280
Don't you feel sorry for him?

391
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,240
Isn't it a lie to be serious?

392
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,060
No, it's not.

393
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,501
I'm sorry. I thought I'd be serious.

394
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
It doesn't matter.

395
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
I can't live with someone who steals money.

396
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,640
Please leave tomorrow.

397
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
To be honest,

398
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,000
I couldn't live with such a cheap person.

399
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,600
You're lying to yourself like that.

400
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,960
No, I'm not.

401
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:14,980
It was my true intention.

402
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:17,860
I was going to give it back
to you, so please believe me.

403
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,140
I don't care.

404
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,600
You're drinking, aren't you?

405
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,460
You lied to me that you
wanted to be serious.

406
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,290
Hey, where are you going?

407
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,890
Wake up, honey.

408
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,750
What are you going to do with him?

409
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,890
Shut up.

410
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,570
Get up!

411
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,410
Get up!

412
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,630
No!

413
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,970
Stop!

414
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
No!

415
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,810
No!

416
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
No!

417
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,800
Don't touch me!

418
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:01,770
No!

419
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,210
Get up!

420
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,380
I thought I was going to
lend you my white skin.

421
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,230
How do you feel?

422
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,750
Don't do it!

423
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,750
How does it feel to be touched
by the sound of a vegetable?

424
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,080
No, don't do it.

425
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:27,600
I'm going to turn you into a monster.

426
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,840
I'm doing something that
will turn you into a monster.

427
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:31,681
It's because you're
doing it for me, isn't it?

428
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,160
How is it?

429
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,960
I want to give it to you.

430
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,760
Stop it.

431
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:13,540
I'll give it to you again.

432
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,430
Stop it.

433
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,710
No.

434
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,470
No!

435
00:38:28,471 --> 00:40:18,400
Don't be angry.

436
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,220
No, it's not.

437
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,150
What's wrong?

438
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,190
What's wrong? Tell me.

439
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,510
Why are you holding your breath?

440
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,960
You're having a bad dream.

441
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,220
You're having a bad dream.

443
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,880
Are you okay?

444
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,160
Are you okay?

445
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:42,161
Stop it!

446
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,840
Are you okay?

447
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,910
Shit!

448
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,170
Shit!

449
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,410
You feel like shit, don't you?

450
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,930
You don't, do you?

451
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,170
No.

452
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,190
Stop it!

453
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:18,191
What's wrong with you?

454
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,190
Stop it!

455
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,450
I'll do it for real this time!

456
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,750
Stop it! That's enough!

457
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,490
It's okay.

458
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,250
It's okay.

459
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,450
Look.

460
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,890
It's okay.

461
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:45,140
It's painful.

462
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,600
What did you say?

463
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,940
It's painful.

464
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:24,570
Did it hurt that much?

465
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,090
Hey, it's been a while, hasn't it?

466
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,620
I can't take it anymore.

467
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:12,920
I can't take it anymore.

468
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,130
Why?

469
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:05,090
Do you feel so good?

470
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:05,170
If I hadn't met you at that time, if I
hadn't been such a good person...

471
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,410
It's delicious.

472
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,120
It's delicious.

473
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:13,640
It's delicious.

474
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,420
I'm glad you liked it.

475
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,540
What's wrong?

476
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,021
I'm going to wash my face.

477
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,740
Oh, I see.

478
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,020
I'll be right back.

479
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,440
Well, the wax is gone.

480
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,800
I want you to buy a new one.

481
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,320
Are you okay?

482
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,320
Yeah.

483
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,501
I'm sorry, but can I ask you a favor?

484
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:40,780
Yeah.

485
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
Thank you.

486
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:42,960
Yeah.

487
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,310
Bye.

488
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,660
What's wrong?

489
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
I need more wax.

490
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,576
Do you want me to get it for you?

491
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
No, I just asked Shihori.

492
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,560
Honey.

493
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:48,380
Yes.

494
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,100
Here you are.

495
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,660
Thank you.

496
01:02:56,515 --> 01:02:57,636
Other companies are popular.

497
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,300
Is this the only one?

498
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,740
No, this is the only one.

499
01:03:07,915 --> 01:03:09,180
Oh, I see.

500
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,180
I'm leaving.

501
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,720
Thank you.

502
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
See you.

503
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,220
I'll do the downstairs.

504
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,350
Can you do it alone?

505
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,680
I can do it.

506
01:03:31,295 --> 01:03:32,520
Can I ask you to do it?

507
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,760
It's okay.

508
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,140
Okay.

509
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,720
Let me know if you need anything.

510
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,940
Okay.

511
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,990
What are you doing?

512
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,600
What about work?

513
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:04,640
I'm getting tired.

514
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:06,890
I'm getting tired.

515
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,040
I'm getting tired.

516
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,760
Don't stop.

517
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:44,640
You were enjoying, weren't you?

518
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:45,740
You were enjoying, weren't you?

519
01:04:45,741 --> 01:04:46,981
You were enjoying, weren't you?

520
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,100
You don't have to be mad at me.

521
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,780
You're crazy.

522
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,900
It's your fault for feeling like that.

523
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
Shiku.

524
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,120
You felt it, didn't you?

525
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,360
Stop it.

526
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,460
You felt it, didn't you?

527
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:17,660
Shiku.

528
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,480
What are you going to do now?

529
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:35,300
You can do it.

530
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,670
You can do it.

531
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,610
You can do it.

532
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:57,080
You can do it.

533
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,690
You can do it.

534
01:07:10,691 --> 01:07:12,950
Don't touch me!

535
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:14,070
You're such a scoundrel.

536
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,630
Don't touch me!

537
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,220
I feel like I'm being pinched.

538
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:32,430
You're such a good girl.

539
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:51,790
My head hurts so much.

540
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,020
It's so hot.

541
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,670
How can you be in such a state?

542
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:16,450
It's so hot.

543
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:17,890
I know you can feel it.

544
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,030
It's so hot.

545
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:21,410
I can't breathe.

546
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,570
I can't breathe.

547
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,420
I can't breathe.

548
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,960
I can't breathe.

549
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:57,350
Here you go.

550
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,170
Are you OK?

551
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:43,890
Yes.

552
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,050
Are you OK?

553
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,920
Yes.

554
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,320
Good.

555
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,720
You can speak now.

556
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,580
I don't want to be found out.

557
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,620
Really?

558
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,780
Come on.

559
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:22,980
Do it properly.

560
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,800
I want to be sucked in by your pussy.

561
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,180
I'll do it with my mouth.

562
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,580
Decide by yourself.

563
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,820
I'm going to die.

564
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,960
I'm going to die.

565
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,300
I'm going to die.

566
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,360
I'm going to die.

567
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,900
I'm going to die.

568
01:21:20,630 --> 01:23:04,940
I'm going to die.

569
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,440
After that, Shihori got
poisoned by Yokoyama's poison.

570
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,820
You like this, don't you?

571
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,620
You must be upset to
feel it with this mouth, right?

572
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:36,090
Forgive me.

573
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,700
You won't be able to tell Kotomi
that you're pregnant, will you?

574
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,040
That's too bad.

575
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,700
She's not answering the phone.

576
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,200
What's wrong?

577
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:21,440
I'm lending her money,
but she hasn't returned it.

578
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,160
And she's not answering the phone.

579
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,340
There's a lot of people
who give back their organs.

580
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,460
With just their mouth.

581
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,760
That's right.

582
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,160
The world we live in now is
really... It's pitch black on both sides.

583
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,320
Yeah, it looks like it.

584
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,540
Yeah. It looks like it.

585
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,801
What's wrong? Are you okay?

586
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:47,630
Well, I've had a stomachache
since this morning.

587
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,070
If you have a stomachache,
you can go home today.

588
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:57,130
Really?

589
01:27:57,131 --> 01:27:57,490
Really?

590
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:58,790
It'll be over soon.

591
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,210
Can I go now?

592
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,610
Yes.

593
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:03,150
Sorry.

594
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:04,490
No, it's fine.

595
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:05,250
Sorry.

596
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:05,730
Yes.

597
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:06,890
Have a good rest.

598
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:08,530
Thank you.

599
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,410
I'm sorry.

600
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:10,690
No, it's fine.

601
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,280
How's work?

602
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:26,780
It's getting better.

603
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:29,820
Jerk.

604
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:32,160
You're the one who feels like a jerk.

605
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:33,161
It's all your fault.

606
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,560
Don't you think it's his fault?

607
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,060
I don't think it's his fault.

608
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,840
It's all your fault.

609
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:32,930
You can't forget this, can you?

610
01:30:34,330 --> 01:31:23,050
You know all the details.

611
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,240
You want me to lick you, don't you?

612
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:52,280
I want you to lick me Do
you want me to lick you?

613
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,840
Do you want me to lick you?

614
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:27,240
You like it, don't you?

615
01:35:27,241 --> 01:36:53,940
You're eating a lot
You like it, don't you?

616
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:55,800
You like to be licked, don't you?

617
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:39,300
You feel good, don't you?

618
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,150
You're making a gentle sound.

619
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,580
I know you like it.

620
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:09,850
Oh, it's great.

621
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:19,130
Oh, it's great.

622
01:42:19,131 --> 01:42:20,131
I'm so happy.

623
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,540
Oh, it's great.

624
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,060
I didn't want you to sleep in such a place.

625
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:03,810
You are so soft.

626
01:43:13,555 --> 01:43:14,910
You have a strong breath.

627
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:26,940
You are so soft.

628
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,280
It's your fault.

629
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,660
I made you like this.

630
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,660
You can do it now, so hang in there.

631
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,560
I can't do it.

I'm scared.

650
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,720

651
01:51:03,721 --> 01:51:05,520

I'm sorry.

657
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:17,440
I'm sorry.

658
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,580
Get up.

659
02:02:42,820 --> 02:03:08,820
I can't do it anymore.

660
02:03:08,821 --> 02:03:09,821
It's too hot.

661
02:04:55,990 --> 02:05:06,560
I can't do it anymore.

662
02:06:08,210 --> 02:06:09,370
I can't believe it.

663
02:06:09,371 --> 02:06:10,590
I'm your friend.

664
02:06:11,590 --> 02:06:12,590
What is this?

665
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:13,950
What's wrong?

666
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:15,470
Nothing.

667
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:17,970
Look at this.

668
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:20,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

669
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:25,130
This is the company's information.

670
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:27,290
Look at this.

671
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:33,050
This is your employee.

672
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:40,150
How am I supposed to face my
superiors when my mother did this to me?

673
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:45,600
I can't believe it.

674
02:06:49,175 --> 02:06:50,175
What am I supposed to do?

675
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:26,950
I lost everything.
