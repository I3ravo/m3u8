1
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm going to play the gachapon.

2
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,130
I'm sorry.

3
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:53,240
It feels good.

4
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:34,550
Oh, no!

5
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:04,750
Oh, it feels good!

6
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,890
I don't usually say this, but
my friend recommended this.

7
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:48,891
It's on the left here.

8
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,950
Am I exaggerating?

9
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,266
The most recent recommendation
I've made is the one on the right!

10
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,730
I am going to try to get close
to the right with a mild face.

11
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,470
I've tried it a lot, but it's good.

12
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,752
I have the basic face
expression, like a white bean cake.

13
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm going to show you how to do it.

14
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm going to show you how to do it.

15
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,660
I'm going to show you how to do it.

16
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:55,061
I'm going to show you how to do it.

17
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,330
I'm going to show you how to do it.

18
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,400
I can't drink any more.

19
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,980
I feel sick.

20
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:15,970
I feel so good.

21
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:31,290
※This is not a sound effect.

22
00:15:32,035 --> 00:16:26,940
Oh, it feels good.

23
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,860
It feels so good.

24
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,150
I'm so sorry.

25
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,890
I feel so bad.

26
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
I feel so bad.

27
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,630
Ah!

28
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:56,040
I feel great! I'm sorry.

29
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,640


30
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,450
Can I move? I feel sick.

31
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:57,050
I feel sick.

32
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,660


33
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,560
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

34
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,060
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

35
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,060
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

36
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:28,940
Hello, I'm Harami!

※This is the sound of a baby crying.

41
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,810
I'm going to take a bath.

42
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
I'm going to take a bath.

43
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,510
I feel good.

44
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,300
I feel so good.

47

Haa...

48
00:32:37,570 --> 00:33:03,040
Let's do it again when you're done.

49
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,180
Sorry, I can't do it any more.

50
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
What?

51
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
How is it? Don't sleep.

52
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,620
Wake up.

53
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
Wake up.

54
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940


55
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,830
Did you sleep? Wake up.

56
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300


57
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,470
I'm going to prank you.

58
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
You don't wake up at all.

59
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,880
Wake up.

60
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,950
You didn't wake up, so I hung the string.

61
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:43,390
Please put your hands together.

62
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,570
Please put your hands together.

63
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:07,360
Please put your hands together.

64
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,890
Are you comfortable?

65
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,690
Yes.

66
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,870
Look at me.

67
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:32,730
Are you comfortable?

68
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,690
Yes.

69
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Yeah.

70
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:49,250
Ah.

71
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,610
Ah.

72
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,930
Ah.

73
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,650
Yeah.

74
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,370
Hehe.

75
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,690
Are you curious?

76
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,550
No.

77
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,730
Hehehe.

78
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,130
Sorry.

79
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,430
Ah.

80
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,590
Ah.

81
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,120
Ah.

82
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,140
Yeah.

83
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
It's hard.

84
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,770
What are you doing?

85
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,710
Are you sleepy?

86
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,810
Yes.

87
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,310
Are you sleepy? I'm fine.

88
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:47,030
Give me a lot.

89
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:48,031
Give me a lot.

90
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,730


91
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,310
Can I?

92
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,030
Ugh...

93
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,450
Ah...

94
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:41,551
Yeah... It's hot.

95
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,990
It's so hot.

96
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,720
Oh, I'm gonna pass out.

97
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,910
Don't worry.

98
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,170
Ah...

99
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,020
Oh...

100
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,021
Ah, it hurts...
It hurts... Ah...

101
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200
Yes.

102
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,990
Yes.

103
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,250
You put a lot in it.

104
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:29,990
It was pleasant.

105
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,380
We met again at the hotel.

106
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,940
Yes.

107
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,920
Do you remember? Yes, I do.

108
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,740


109
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,520
The old days?

110
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,360
Yes.

111
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,000
Do you remember what it
was like in the old days? I do.

112
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,690


113
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:41,120
Do you remember? A little.

114
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880


115
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,670
Are you excited? Yes, I am.

116
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,590


117
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:49,190
Do you want more?

118
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:50,350
Yes.

119
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,090
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

120
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,770
I'm sorry.

121
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,940

Oh, no!

142
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:07,150
Ah, it feels good.

143
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:27,250
Ah, it feels good.

144
00:56:21,055 --> 00:56:25,850
It's no good, it's no good.

145
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:49,900
No, no, no.

146
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,160
My arm hurts.

147
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,210
I'm sorry.

148
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,450

You are wet.

152

Yes, I am.

153
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:29,670
She is gone.

154
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,170
Yes, she is.

155
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:45,700
Do you want more? Good morning.

156

Good morning.

157

No, no, no.

158
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:36,940
I can't do it anymore.

159

※I'm sorry if my English is bad.

160

I'm sorry.

178
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
I'm sorry.

179
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:03,080
I feel so bad.

I feel so bad.

183
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:25,980
I feel sick.

184
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,090
I feel sick.

185
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:36,201
I'm so sleepy.

186
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:24,010
I feel so good.

187
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,440
I'm sleepy.

188
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,690
I'm full.

189
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:02,730
What's wrong?

190
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:18,550
What's wrong? I'm fine.

191

197
01:12:44,550 --> 01:13:05,980
Do you have any
medicine? I'm sorry.

198
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,080
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

199
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,660
I'm not sure if it's because I've
never seen a baby cry like this before.

200
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:08,900
I'm not sure if it's because I've
never seen a baby cry like this before.

I'm sorry.

225
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,810
I'm sorry.

226
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,740
I'm so sleepy.

227
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,830
I feel so good.

228
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,270

233
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,530
Do you like pig?

234
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:14,670
Pig?

235
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:54,950
It looks delicious.

236
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,910
Is it delicious? A little.

237
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:25,530
It's cute.

238
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:27,910
Let's pour it slowly.

239
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:17,020
This is an experiment to see
how much the baby can swallow.

240
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,360
The baby is chewing the gum.

241
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,210
The baby is not able to swallow the gum.

242

Feels good!

254
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:35,780
Oh!

255
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,480

Oh! It feels good.

257
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:41,160
It feels good.

258
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,990
It feels good.

259
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,150
It feels good.

260
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,660


261
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,520
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

262
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,000
It's gross!

263
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:54,850
I want to be a mom.

264
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:32,160
It's gross! I'm sorry.

265
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:54,370
I'm sorry.

266
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:01,830
I'm sorry.

267
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,620
Nope.

268
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:14,780
No, no.

269
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:23,830
Ouch.

270
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:23,880
I'm sorry.

271
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,800
I'm sorry.

272
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:30,660
I can't do it anymore.

273
01:36:44,470 --> 01:37:05,000
I can't do it anymore.

274
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:36,420
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

276
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:54,550

Oh, no!

280
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:58,420
What a pity!

281
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:13,770
I should have brought a towel.

282
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:24,100
Oh... Oh... oh...

283
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:32,360
Oh... It's disgusting.

284

It's painful.

292
01:41:57,831 --> 01:41:58,090
It's all in.

293
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,730
It's all in.

294
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,500
Oh, it's deep.

01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:49,450
I'm so sorry.

301
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:50,451
Are you that
excited? I'm so sorry.

I can't breathe.
I feel like I'm going to pass out.

312
01:47:09,895 --> 01:47:57,770
Hello, everyone.

313

I can't do it. I can't do it. I feel sick.

321

I feel sick.

322
01:53:54,110 --> 01:54:08,850
I can't do it. I can't do it.

323
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:14,210
I feel sick.

324
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:21,410
I feel sick.

325
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:34,400
