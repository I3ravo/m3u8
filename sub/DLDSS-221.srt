1
12.02 --> 16.02
 Sensei, is it okay for you to be here?

2
17.02 --> 19.02
 It's been a week.

3
19.02 --> 58.00
 Since when did I make a mistake?

4
58.00 --> 60.00
 Get a hold of yourself.

5
60.00 --> 62.00
 But I can't go back anymore.

6
62.00 --> 65.00
 This is where I belong now.

7
65.00 --> 72.98
 You're smoking at school again?

8
72.98 --> 78.00
 I told you, it's not mine.

9
78.00 --> 81.00
 Damn, you're obviously smoking.

10
81.00 --> 83.00
 I'm not smoking.

11
83.00 --> 84.00
 Shut up.

12
84.00 --> 86.00
 Don't judge me like that.

13
86.00 --> 87.00
 Do you have any proof?

14
87.00 --> 90.00
 It's been three years since I left this school.

15
90.00 --> 94.00
 Now I'm in charge of the school.

16
94.00 --> 99.00
 But there's one student in my class who's always causing trouble.

17
99.00 --> 101.00
 It's getting on my nerves.

18
101.00 --> 104.00
 I'll report this to my parents.

19
104.00 --> 114.39
 Do whatever you want.

20
114.39 --> 117.39
 It's Tatsuya again.

21
117.39 --> 119.39
 Your class is in trouble too.

22
119.39 --> 121.39
 I'm sorry.

23
121.39 --> 123.39
 If it wasn't for her...

24
123.39 --> 129.39
 Tomoda-sensei.

25
129.39 --> 131.39
 Yes?

26
131.39 --> 135.39
 About what we were talking about...

27
135.39 --> 141.05
 I'm sorry, I have to go to my next class.

28
141.05 --> 143.05
 Oh, I see.

29
143.05 --> 157.62
 You're such a jerk.

30
157.62 --> 161.62
 Don't get so mad just because you found out I was smoking.

31
161.62 --> 163.62
 By the way...

32
163.62 --> 169.26
 How did it go with the proposal?

33
169.26 --> 173.26
 I haven't found a good one yet.

34
173.26 --> 177.26
 You didn't forget, did you?

35
177.26 --> 179.26
 No, I didn't.

36
179.26 --> 180.26
 Don't get mad.

37
180.26 --> 182.26
 I'll look for one.

38
182.26 --> 185.89
 I'm sorry.

39
189.89 --> 190.89
 Hello?

40
190.89 --> 192.89
 What's up?

41
192.89 --> 194.89
 Tatsuya-kun.

42
194.89 --> 198.89
 I put that thing on the back of the phone box.

43
198.89 --> 200.89
 Oh, I see.

44
200.89 --> 202.89
 Aren't you always late?

45
202.89 --> 206.89
 I want something like this right away.

46
206.89 --> 208.89
 I'm sorry.

47
208.89 --> 210.89
 I'll be more careful next time.

48
210.89 --> 227.45
 I'm counting on you.

49
227.45 --> 230.45
 You still have some left, right?

50
230.45 --> 231.45
 Yes.

51
231.45 --> 236.45
 I still don't have all the materials for tomorrow's class.

52
236.45 --> 239.45
 You're so busy.

53
239.45 --> 242.45
 I have to finish it as soon as possible.

54
242.45 --> 248.81
 Oh, well...

55
248.81 --> 250.81
 Tomoda-sensei.

56
250.81 --> 251.81
 Yes?

57
251.81 --> 274.19
 I haven't heard from you about what we talked about the other day.

58
274.19 --> 277.19
 I'm sorry for being so busy.

59
277.19 --> 284.19
 I just want to be serious with you.

60
284.19 --> 291.89
 Can't we get married?

61
291.89 --> 293.89
 I'm sorry.

62
293.89 --> 298.89
 I can't think about that right now.

63
298.89 --> 299.89
 Oh.

64
299.89 --> 306.89
 You mean you can think about it later, right?

65
306.89 --> 310.89
 No, it's not like that.

66
310.89 --> 323.03
 Hello?

67
323.03 --> 325.03
 Hello, sensei?

68
325.03 --> 327.03
 It's me, Tatsuya.

69
327.03 --> 329.03
 Tatsuya-kun?

70
329.03 --> 331.03
 What's wrong?

71
331.03 --> 333.03
 Why do you have this number?

72
333.03 --> 335.03
 It doesn't matter.

73
335.03 --> 338.03
 I want to reflect on myself.

74
338.03 --> 341.03
 I want to start over with my school life.

75
341.03 --> 347.03
 That's why I want to cut ties with my bad friend.

76
347.03 --> 352.03
 Sensei, can you give me some advice now?

77
352.03 --> 355.03
 Can't I go to school tomorrow?

78
355.03 --> 361.03
 If you go to school, you'll be like that again, won't you?

79
361.03 --> 367.03
 So, can you come to me now?

80
367.03 --> 371.03
 Then I can tell you everything honestly.

81
371.03 --> 374.03
 I think I can listen to you.

82
374.03 --> 376.03
 Please, sensei.

83
376.03 --> 379.03
 I want to change.

84
379.03 --> 385.42
 I understand.

85
385.42 --> 388.42
 Where should I go?

86
388.42 --> 390.42
 Yes.

87
390.42 --> 394.56
 Yes.

88
394.56 --> 395.56
 I understand.

89
395.56 --> 403.22
 I'll go now.

90
403.22 --> 404.22
 I'm sorry.

91
404.22 --> 407.22
 I was suddenly called by the student council.

92
407.22 --> 410.92
 I'll go ahead.

93
410.92 --> 431.32
 See you.

94
431.32 --> 437.32
 Don't tell me you're going to use it on Tomoda-sensei from now on.

95
437.32 --> 439.32
 That's right.

96
439.32 --> 444.53
 I'm annoyed by your lecture.

97
444.53 --> 446.53
 I see.

98
446.53 --> 449.53
 What? Do you have a problem?

99
449.53 --> 451.97
 No.

100
451.97 --> 454.97
 Be careful not to use it too much.

101
454.97 --> 456.97
 That's disgusting.

102
456.97 --> 462.80
 See you.

103
462.80 --> 501.28
 I'm counting on you.

104
501.28 --> 503.28
 What are you talking about?

105
503.28 --> 507.28
 Tatsuya, what's going on?

106
507.28 --> 511.28
 Didn't you want to introduce this guy to me?

107
511.28 --> 513.28
 What are you talking about?

108
513.28 --> 516.28
 I'm his teacher.

109
516.28 --> 526.07
 Tatsuya, didn't you want to talk to me?

110
526.07 --> 529.07
 I'm sorry, sensei.

111
529.07 --> 532.07
 It's a lie.

112
532.07 --> 537.45
 But I have a favor to ask you.

113
537.45 --> 541.78
 What is it?

114
541.78 --> 545.78
 I want you to be my mistress.

115
545.78 --> 547.78
 What?

116
547.78 --> 550.78
 I see.

117
550.78 --> 552.78
 Stop it.

118
552.78 --> 554.78
 Let me go.

119
554.78 --> 556.78
 What are you doing? Let me go.

120
556.78 --> 558.78
 Stop it.

121
558.78 --> 562.35
 Sensei.

122
562.35 --> 565.35
 I'm very angry.

123
565.35 --> 567.35
 You're always lecturing me.

124
567.35 --> 570.35
 So, please do it this time.

125
570.35 --> 576.35
 You're crazy to impersonate a teacher.

126
576.35 --> 578.35
 Stop it.

127
578.35 --> 580.35
 Let me go.

128
580.35 --> 583.35
 You'll get hurt.

129
583.35 --> 585.35
 Stop it.

130
585.35 --> 590.35
 Let's play a little.

131
590.35 --> 592.35
 Stop it.

132
595.35 --> 598.35
 You'll get hurt.

133
598.35 --> 601.35
 Do it if you can.

134
601.35 --> 603.35
 You're good at it.

135
603.35 --> 607.35
 How long will you keep doing it?

136
607.35 --> 609.35
 Tatsuya.

137
609.35 --> 611.35
 Bring that to me.

138
611.35 --> 613.35
 Can I use it?

139
613.35 --> 615.35
 Of course.

140
615.35 --> 617.35
 Open your mouth.

141
617.35 --> 619.35
 Do you know what it is?

142
619.35 --> 621.35
 I don't know.

143
621.35 --> 623.35
 Stop it.

144
623.35 --> 625.35
 Open your mouth.

145
631.35 --> 634.35
 What are you wearing?

146
634.35 --> 636.35
 It's expensive.

147
636.35 --> 638.35
 Don't play with it.

148
638.35 --> 640.35
 Go to Bingo.

149
640.35 --> 642.35
 Go to Bingo.

150
642.35 --> 644.35
 Open your mouth.

151
644.35 --> 646.35
 Go to Bingo.

152
646.35 --> 648.35
 Go to Bingo.

153
651.35 --> 677.23
 It's dangerous.

154
677.23 --> 679.23
 I'll touch it.

155
679.23 --> 681.23
 Stop it.

156
681.23 --> 683.23
 Let me touch it.

157
683.23 --> 685.23
 Stop it.

158
685.23 --> 687.23
 Let me touch it.

159
687.23 --> 691.23
 You feel good, don't you?

160
691.23 --> 694.23
 You feel strange, don't you?

161
694.23 --> 696.23
 Stop it.

162
696.23 --> 700.23
 You feel strange, don't you?

163
702.23 --> 706.23
 You're really good at it.

164
706.23 --> 710.23
 What are you doing?

165
710.23 --> 712.23
 You're like a child.

166
712.23 --> 714.23
 You're playing with it.

167
714.23 --> 716.23
 Stop it.

168
716.23 --> 718.23
 Let me touch it.

169
718.23 --> 720.23
 Stop it.

170
724.23 --> 727.23
 You have a beautiful body.

171
727.23 --> 730.23
 Stop it.

172
730.23 --> 733.23
 You're crazy.

173
733.23 --> 735.23
 I'm older than you.

174
735.23 --> 737.23
 You're good.

175
737.23 --> 739.23
 Are you okay?

176
739.23 --> 741.23
 Stop it.

177
741.23 --> 744.23
 Let me kiss you.

178
745.23 --> 747.23
 Let me kiss you.

179
747.23 --> 749.23
 Stop it.

180
772.80 --> 774.80
 You have a beautiful body.

181
774.80 --> 777.80
 You have a beautiful body.

182
778.80 --> 780.80
 Let me kiss you.

183
784.80 --> 786.80
 You're crazy.

184
786.80 --> 788.80
 Let me kiss you.

185
788.80 --> 796.66
 You're crazy.

186
796.66 --> 798.66
 Let me kiss you.

187
798.66 --> 800.66
 No.

188
800.66 --> 802.66
 No.

189
804.66 --> 806.66
 Stop it.

190
809.66 --> 811.66
 You're crazy.

191
860.25 --> 862.25
 It's a baby.

192
871.39 --> 873.39
 You're holding it so beautifully.

193
874.39 --> 876.39
 It's a waste to hide it.

194
884.39 --> 886.39
 Oh, good reaction.

195
887.39 --> 889.39
 You haven't touched it yet.

196
893.39 --> 895.39
 You have a good reaction.

197
904.39 --> 906.39
 What's wrong?

198
906.39 --> 908.39
 Where did the other one go?

199
911.90 --> 913.90
 Oh, you're running away.

200
914.90 --> 916.90
 Oh, good.

201
918.90 --> 920.90
 Come on, come on, come on.

202
920.90 --> 922.90
 You can do it.

203
922.90 --> 924.90
 Get up.

204
926.90 --> 928.90
 No, no, no, no, no.

205
929.90 --> 931.90
 You can't run away.

206
931.90 --> 933.90
 Give up and play.

207
937.90 --> 939.90
 Show me your butt.

208
940.90 --> 942.90
 It's a butt.

209
943.90 --> 945.90
 No, no, no, no.

210
946.90 --> 948.90
 It's hard.

211
951.90 --> 953.90
 Oh, good.

212
957.90 --> 959.90
 You have a good reaction.

213
959.90 --> 961.90
 Let's blow on it again.

214
961.90 --> 963.90
 You blow on it, too.

215
966.90 --> 968.90
 It's funny.

216
970.90 --> 972.90
 It's just a little touch.

217
975.90 --> 977.90
 No, no, no.

218
978.90 --> 983.36
 No, no, no, no.

219
983.36 --> 985.36
 Oh, my God.

220
985.36 --> 987.36
 You're all sensitive.

221
988.36 --> 990.36
 Here.

222
990.36 --> 992.36
 Where?

223
992.36 --> 994.36
 Here.

224
994.36 --> 996.36
 You're weak.

225
997.36 --> 999.36
 You're surprised.

226
1000.36 --> 1002.36
 You're sensitive.

227
1002.36 --> 1004.36
 You're weak.

228
1009.36 --> 1011.36
 Oh, good.

229
1018.36 --> 1020.36
 Oh, good.

230
1026.36 --> 1028.36
 No, no, no, no, no.

231
1028.36 --> 1030.36
 You can't run away.

232
1030.36 --> 1032.36
 Oh, you're running away.

233
1032.36 --> 1034.36
 Oh, you caught it.

234
1035.36 --> 1037.36
 Oh, good.

235
1037.36 --> 1039.36
 You're so cool.

236
1040.36 --> 1042.36
 Let's take a look.

237
1043.36 --> 1046.36
 You don't get a chance to see this kind of thing.

238
1048.36 --> 1050.36
 We're always doing it.

239
1054.36 --> 1058.36
 You have a better reaction than any other woman.

240
1061.36 --> 1063.36
 Look.

241
1064.36 --> 1066.36
 What's wrong?

242
1071.70 --> 1073.70
 You're sweating a lot.

243
1075.70 --> 1086.43
 You're shaking a lot.

244
1095.43 --> 1097.43
 Does this feel good?

245
1097.43 --> 1099.43
 What do you think?

246
1099.43 --> 1101.43
 Doesn't it feel good?

247
1101.43 --> 1103.43
 Doesn't it feel good?

248
1106.43 --> 1108.43
 It doesn't feel good, does it?

249
1113.43 --> 1115.43
 Are you all right?

250
1115.43 --> 1117.43
 Are you surprised?

251
1117.43 --> 1119.43
 Here we go.

252
1119.43 --> 1121.43
 Here we go.

253
1121.43 --> 1123.43
 Here we go.

254
1123.43 --> 1125.43
 Here we go.

255
1125.43 --> 1127.43
 Here we go.

256
1132.43 --> 1134.43
 That's great.

257
1135.43 --> 1137.43
 That's great.

258
1144.43 --> 1146.43
 Oh, you're going to take it off.

259
1146.43 --> 1148.43
 Oh, you're going to take it off.

260
1156.43 --> 1158.43
 You look sexy in that outfit.

261
1158.43 --> 1168.14
 You look sexy in that outfit.

262
1174.58 --> 1176.58
 You have wonderful buttocks.

263
1192.93 --> 1195.93
 Even if you say it doesn't feel good, your face is soft.

264
1195.93 --> 1197.93
 It doesn't feel good.

265
1197.93 --> 1199.93
 It doesn't feel good.

266
1200.93 --> 1203.93
 Even if you say it doesn't feel good, your face is soft.

267
1203.93 --> 1205.93
 Even if you say it doesn't feel good, your face is soft.

268
1210.88 --> 1212.88
 What's going on inside?

269
1213.88 --> 1215.88
 Open it.

270
1215.88 --> 1217.88
 Open it.

271
1217.88 --> 1221.88
 Let me see.

272
1221.88 --> 1224.88
 It's beautiful.

273
1224.88 --> 1227.88
 Let me see.

274
1227.88 --> 1230.88
 Can you see it?

275
1230.88 --> 1233.88
 It's good.

276
1242.88 --> 1248.98
 Is it here?

277
1248.98 --> 1251.98
 It's here.

278
1251.98 --> 1254.98
 Do you know where you are being touched?

279
1254.98 --> 1257.98
 Do you know where you are being touched?

280
1275.17 --> 1277.17
 It's amazing.

281
1277.17 --> 1280.17
 It's the worst. It's my bed.

282
1280.17 --> 1283.17
 What are you doing?

283
1283.17 --> 1286.17
 It's your bed.

284
1286.17 --> 1289.17
 What are you doing?

285
1289.17 --> 1292.17
 Don't do that.

286
1292.17 --> 1302.75
 Open your mouth.

287
1302.75 --> 1305.75
 I'll open your mouth.

288
1305.75 --> 1308.75
 I'll open your mouth.

289
1311.75 --> 1314.75
 It's your juice.

290
1314.75 --> 1317.75
 It's your juice.

291
1317.75 --> 1320.75
 You're in my way.

292
1320.75 --> 1325.64
 You're in my way.

293
1325.64 --> 1328.64
 You're in my way.

294
1328.64 --> 1331.64
 I'll do it, too.

295
1331.64 --> 1334.64
 It's good.

296
1338.64 --> 1364.52
 It's on your face.

297
1364.52 --> 1367.52
 You're mean.

298
1367.52 --> 1370.52
 You're mean.

299
1370.52 --> 1373.52
 You're in my way.

300
1373.52 --> 1376.52
 You're mean.

301
1376.52 --> 1379.52
 You're in my way.

302
1379.52 --> 1382.52
 How do you feel?

303
1382.52 --> 1385.52
 Open your mouth.

304
1385.52 --> 1388.52
 How do you feel?

305
1388.52 --> 1391.52
 Do you want to run away again?

306
1391.52 --> 1394.52
 Do you want to run away again?

307
1394.52 --> 1397.52
 No.

308
1398.52 --> 1401.52
 It's the worst.

309
1401.52 --> 1404.52
 It's the worst.

310
1404.52 --> 1407.52
 It's amazing.

311
1409.52 --> 1414.41
 Come here.

312
1414.41 --> 1417.41
 Open your mouth.

313
1417.41 --> 1420.41
 It's easier if you eat this.

314
1420.41 --> 1423.41
 Open your mouth.

315
1423.41 --> 1426.41
 Open your mouth.

316
1432.36 --> 1435.36
 It's disgusting.

317
1445.58 --> 1448.58
 It's disgusting.

318
1448.58 --> 1451.58
 Open your mouth.

319
1451.58 --> 1454.58
 Open your mouth.

320
1456.58 --> 1459.58
 Open your mouth.

321
1459.58 --> 1462.58
 I can't open my mouth.

322
1462.58 --> 1465.58
 I don't know what he's saying.

323
1535.40 --> 1542.94
 It's so hot.

324
1548.46 --> 1550.46
 It's so hot.

325
1554.46 --> 1556.46
 I don't want to do it.

326
1557.46 --> 1559.46
 Do you want me to push you from behind?

327
1559.46 --> 1560.46
 Is that OK?

328
1560.46 --> 1561.46
 Yes.

329
1561.46 --> 1562.46
 Hey!

330
1562.46 --> 1572.71
 Hey!

331
1572.71 --> 1573.71
 Hey!

332
1573.71 --> 1574.71
 Hey!

333
1574.71 --> 1575.71
 Hey!

334
1576.71 --> 1580.66
 Ouch!

335
1580.66 --> 1582.66
 Let me out.

336
1582.66 --> 1584.66
 Let me out.

337
1594.09 --> 1596.09
 It feels good.

338
1600.09 --> 1606.34
 No, no, no, no.

339
1609.78 --> 1610.78
 Are you OK?

340
1610.78 --> 1611.78
 What?

341
1611.78 --> 1612.78
 Can I put you in the bath?

342
1612.78 --> 1613.78
 Are you OK?

343
1613.78 --> 1614.78
 Are you serious?

344
1614.78 --> 1615.78
 You're so strong.

345
1615.78 --> 1616.78
 Stop it.

346
1616.78 --> 1617.78
 Stop it.

347
1618.78 --> 1620.78
 Be careful.

348
1623.78 --> 1624.78
 What?

349
1624.78 --> 1625.78
 Do you have a rubber band?

350
1627.78 --> 1628.78
 It's OK.

351
1628.78 --> 1629.78
 It's OK.

352
1630.78 --> 1631.78
 Be quiet.

353
1633.78 --> 1638.59
 It feels good.

354
1639.59 --> 1647.26
 You're so noisy.

355
1647.26 --> 1649.26
 You're so noisy.

356
1649.26 --> 1650.26
 You're so noisy.

357
1650.26 --> 1651.26
 Be quiet.

358
1652.26 --> 1653.26
 Hey.

359
1656.26 --> 1657.26
 Be quiet.

360
1657.26 --> 1658.26
 Be quiet.

361
1658.26 --> 1659.26
 I'll help you.

362
1673.92 --> 1674.92
 Ouch!

363
1681.79 --> 1682.79
 It feels good.

364
1682.79 --> 1683.79
 It feels good.

365
1687.79 --> 1705.66
 Open your mouth.

366
1707.66 --> 1708.66
 Stop it.

367
1708.66 --> 1709.66
 Stop it.

368
1710.66 --> 1711.66
 Stop it.

369
1715.16 --> 1716.16
 Does it feel good?

370
1720.16 --> 1721.16
 That's good.

371
1723.16 --> 1725.16
 You look so good.

372
1731.20 --> 1733.20
 I'm glad that you feel good.

373
1742.10 --> 1745.88
 That's great.

374
1745.88 --> 1746.88
 That's good.

375
1749.88 --> 1754.56
 Oh, no.

376
1754.56 --> 1755.56
 I'm going.

377
1755.56 --> 1756.56
 I'll run away.

378
1758.56 --> 1759.56
 Later.

379
1759.56 --> 1761.56
 Your bed is terrible.

380
1761.56 --> 1762.56
 It's OK.

381
1762.56 --> 1763.56
 Go ahead.

382
1763.56 --> 1764.56
 I'll run away.

383
1765.56 --> 1767.56
 I'll give you a chance.

384
1767.56 --> 1768.56
 I'll give you a chance.

385
1768.56 --> 1769.56
 I'll run away.

386
1770.56 --> 1771.56
 I'll run away.

387
1773.56 --> 1774.56
 Stop it.

388
1774.56 --> 1775.56
 Don't be depressed.

389
1777.56 --> 1780.56
 I'll teach you a lesson.

390
1780.56 --> 1781.56
 Please lie down.

391
1781.56 --> 1782.56
 Please lie down.

392
1784.56 --> 1785.56
 I'll move you.

393
1789.56 --> 1790.56
 Please lie down.

394
1790.56 --> 1791.56
 It's cold.

395
1791.56 --> 1792.56
 The bed is cold.

396
1792.56 --> 1793.56
 Hold my hand.

397
1797.56 --> 1798.56
 I'll do it.

398
1798.56 --> 1799.56
 I'll do it.

399
1842.02 --> 1843.02
 Go ahead.

400
1847.02 --> 1848.02
 Lift your face.

401
1848.02 --> 1849.02
 Lift your face.

402
1849.02 --> 1850.02
 That's right.

403
1853.02 --> 1854.02
 Go ahead.

404
1854.02 --> 1855.02
 I'll put a demon on you.

405
1856.02 --> 1857.02
 Go ahead.

406
1858.02 --> 1859.02
 Go ahead.

407
1868.54 --> 1869.54
 It's wonderful.

408
1869.54 --> 1870.54
 That's great.

409
1870.54 --> 1871.54
 It's the best.

410
1876.54 --> 1877.54
 That's great.

411
1877.54 --> 1878.54
 Your boobs are...

412
1879.54 --> 1881.54
 Your boobs are wonderful.

413
1886.54 --> 1887.54
 I'll do it.

414
1887.54 --> 1888.54
 Please lie down.

415
1894.54 --> 1896.54
 I'll put a demon on you.

416
1913.15 --> 1914.15
 That's great.

417
1919.15 --> 1920.15
 I'm tired.

418
1928.15 --> 1929.15
 I'm tired.

419
1940.06 --> 1941.06
 It's wonderful.

420
1943.06 --> 1944.06
 It's wonderful.

421
1944.06 --> 1945.06
 Please lie down.

422
1945.06 --> 1946.06
 Please lie down.

423
1948.06 --> 1949.06
 Can you hear me?

424
1950.06 --> 1951.06
 Come on.

425
1951.06 --> 1952.06
 Look at me.

426
1956.06 --> 1957.06
 Why are you looking at me?

427
1957.06 --> 1958.06
 Look at me.

428
1961.06 --> 1962.06
 Are you all right?

429
1962.06 --> 1964.06
 You have to be strong.

430
1964.06 --> 1965.06
 You're an adult.

431
1966.06 --> 1967.06
 You're an adult.

432
1967.06 --> 1968.06
 You're a child.

433
1968.06 --> 1969.06
 Be strong.

434
2032.04 --> 2035.63
 Please look at me.

435
2084.85 --> 2085.85
 Don't look at me.

436
2086.85 --> 2087.85
 Don't look at me.

437
2088.85 --> 2089.85
 You're already falling down.

438
2092.85 --> 2093.85
 Don't look at me.

439
5346.84 --> 5348.84
 Hey.

440
5348.84 --> 5350.84
 Hey.

441
5350.84 --> 5352.84
 You are already strong.

442
5352.84 --> 5354.84
 You can do it.

443
5354.84 --> 5360.39
 Here, let's take a breath.

444
5360.39 --> 5362.39
 Breathe in and out.

445
5362.39 --> 5364.39
 Breathe in and out.

446
5364.39 --> 5366.39
 Breathe in.

447
5366.39 --> 5368.39
 You did it.

448
5368.39 --> 5379.00
 Oh.

449
5379.00 --> 5381.00
 Oh.

450
5381.00 --> 5383.00
 Ah.

451
5383.00 --> 5385.00
 Oh.

452
5385.00 --> 5387.00
 Yeah.
