1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,880
Please introduce yourself.

2
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:14,420
I'm Tomoko Naedan. I'm 25 years old.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,620
I'm Kazuki. I'm 35 years old.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,940
How many years have you been married?

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,560
It's been 3 years.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
About a year.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,690
About a year ago,

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,880
I was doing diving as a hobby.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,600
In Miyakojima?

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,140
Yes, in Miyakojima.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,940
We met at Miyakojima.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,960
He used to be my diving buddy.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,600
He was very quiet.

14
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:58,020
He was quiet and I was a little worried
about what kind of person he was.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,340
He invited me to dinner.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,280
I got used to him and I could talk to him.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,460
I thought he was a beautiful
person from the beginning.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,000
It's embarrassing.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,820
But you pretended not to look at me.

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,180
Oh, did I?

21
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,390
Yes, you pretended not to look at me.

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,280
Then we got along well.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,420
We started to like each other naturally.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,260
And now we are married.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,440
Why did you want to swap this time?

26
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,681
Why did you apply for this job?

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,420
Well, to be honest,
I'm interested in this job.

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,860
Did you apply because your wife
was dissatisfied with your husband?

29
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,101
Did you apply because you have
something you want to do? Of course not.

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,390


31
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:12,940
Of course I love diving
and I have no complaints.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,383
I don't have a hobby.
However, I like diving,

33
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:26,180
skydiving, surfing and
other marine sports.

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:35,400
I also like mountain climbing.
I like adventures.

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,860
I like her a lot. Even if she
wears a pink mask, I don't like it.

36
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,380
I'm told that I'm the
opposite of my appearance.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm told that I'm more active,
but in fact, she's very active.

38
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,340
I prefer to stay at home.

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
I'd like to talk about sex.

40
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:03,620
I'd like to talk about sex.
What kind of sex do you usually have?

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,420
I don't know if it's normal.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,140
I don't think it's normal.
I don't know much about people's sex.

43
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
I don't know.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
What is it? I don't know.

45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,560
I think it's normal.

46
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
It's normal.

47
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,700
How many times a month do you get
married in the third year of marriage?

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,700
It was a little less than the first time.

49
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,980
It was a little less than the first time.

50
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,640
The number of times has
gradually calmed down.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,060
What kind of couple do you want
to have when you do swapping?

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, the computer chooses, but if there
is hope I feel that the type is different

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,560
I see I wonder what
What do you think of me?

54
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm like this, so I want you to go out.

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Go out?

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,480
Do you want to pull me?

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Yes.

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,260
I don't know.

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
You look cheerful.

60
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,560
Ichiro, 32 years old.

61
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,240
Misato, 26 years old.

62
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:56,520
I used to work as an
instructor in a team called 〇〇.

63
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:05,560
At that time, there was a yoga
instructor, and that's where we met.

64
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,521
How many years have you been married?

65
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,331
How long have you
been doing this? 2 years.

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,200
Oh, 2 years.

67
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,660
2 years.

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,360
Yes, 2 years.

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800


70
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm a bit older now,
so I'm in the business.

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,920
Now, I'm doing a salon business.

72
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Is it yoga?

73
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,400
Isn't it yoga?

74
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,860
What do you do? Nail salon.

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,440
Oh, you do nail salon?

76
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,900
What are you doing? You suddenly
changed again, didn't you? Yes, I did.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
I see.

78
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880


79
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,420
You look quite clean.

80
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
Do you like to take a picture
of your face? Yes, I do.

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760


82
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,460
You are beautiful.

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
You are a good man, too.

84
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Yes, I am.

85
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,720
It's a shame that I can't talk to you.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,120
I thought you were cute.

87
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,220
Your first impression of me was cute.

88
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,800
I didn't think about marriage at all.

89
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,860
I just wanted to have fun.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
I wasn't serious at all.

91
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,360
I had a girlfriend, too.

92
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,220
I'm a straight-A student.

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,920
A straight-A
student? No, I'm not.

94
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,580


95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm almost a straight-A student.

96
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm a straight-A student.

97
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm really tall.

98
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,061
What?

99
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,540
Are you bragging? No, I'm not.

100
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,161
How do you feel? I feel good.

101
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800


102
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,740
Do you have a lot of sexual desire?

103
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,220
I don't think so.

104
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,240
I think I have a lot of sexual desire.

105
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,241
It's amazing.

106
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
What is amazing? Today.

107
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,600
..

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
What?

109
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,050
I did it earlier today.

110
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,450
Is it amazing?

111
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,990
But isn't it normal?

112
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:21,810
How many times do you do it?

113
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,350
I do it five times a day.

114
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,690
Do you still do
it? I still do it.

115
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,070


116
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,150
You've known each other
for a long time, haven't you?

117
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,706
Yes, we've known each
other for a long time.

118
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,990
I've heard that you've known each other
for 2 or 3 years before you got married.

119
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,510
Yes, I have.

120
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:47,310
I feel like I'm stronger than I am now.

121
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,830
Do you?

122
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:50,831
Yes.

123
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,531
Especially since I decided to do swapping,

124
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,110
I've been getting a lot of requests.

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,630
I don't know why, but I've
been getting a lot of requests.

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Do you have any wishes?

127
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,050
Do you have any couple
guides or anything like that?

128
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,550
Well, I don't like people who are fat.

129
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm not good at it. If I can, I'll do it.

130
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,390
I like clean people,
but I'm not good at it.

131
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,980
You're nervous, aren't you?

132
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,780
This is the best matching
that the computer chose.

133
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,860
The matching rate is 93%.
It's a pretty good one.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,680
It's a pretty good one if it's over 90%.

135
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:53,812
Now, everyone is wearing a mask,
but at this point, please take off

136
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,260
your mask if it is okay to look at
each other in the first impression.

137
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,820
If not, you can go home on the spot.

138
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Yes, please.

139
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,020
Yes, then, everyone, please say hello.

140
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,900
My name is Ueda.

141
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:21,901
What's your name?

142
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,720
My name is Maeda.

143
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,860
Nice to meet you, Maeda.

144
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,920
Nice to meet you, too.

145
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:32,921
What do you think of me?

146
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
What do you think
of me? You're cute.

147
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,600


148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
You're cute, aren't
you? I touched you.

149
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840


150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Are you sure? I'm Togo.

151
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,120


152
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,540
You're beautiful.

154
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,541
I'm so nervous.

155
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,520
Hi, I'm Kazuki Maezawa.

156
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,040
I'm Kazuki Maezawa.

157
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,321
I'm an employee of this company.

158
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,560
What we have in front of
you is… I think you've noticed,

159
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,760
but we have many items in front of you.

160
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,060
We're going to lend to you for free.

161
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,300
Please take what you like.

162
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,640
Please take a look.
There are various things.

163
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,180
This is a part of me.

164
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,220
There are a lot of things in the warehouse.

165
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Please take home what
you like and play with them.

166
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,640
What do you think? I don't know.

167
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,460


168
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Can I cut this?

169
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
What is that?

170
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,460
Oh, it looks like a soap.

171
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Is it a soap?

172
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,600
The contents are...

173
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,556
There are many more wonderful things.

174
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,820
There are so many small things.

175
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,800
Please take a look.

176
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
What is this? I like this.

177
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,940
What is this? This is.

178
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,040
..

179
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,390
This is...

180
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
It's different.

181
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,860
You know what it is, don't you?

182
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
It's all different.

183
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,560
We have good news for you.

184
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,360
Since it's our one-year anniversary,

185
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,520
we have more than 10,000 subscribers.

186
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
This time,

187
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
we are giving away a
lottery for a hot spring trip.

188
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,207
We also have a lottery
where you can win a

189
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,201
lottery ticket, so if
you like it, please try it.

190
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,480
I'd love to see it.

191
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,220
And, well, is it okay if we
say it's okay for both of us?

192
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Yes.

193
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I like it.

194
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Yes.

195
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:39,120
If that's the case, I'd like you to have
sex in front of each other's partners.

196
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,500
Are you ready?

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,600
I think it's difficult to swap suddenly.

198
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:56,580
First of all, let's have sex in front of
each other's partners and get used to it.

199
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,540
After that, let's take various steps.

200
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,820
What do you think?

201
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm totally fine.

202
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,960
Are you okay?

203
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
Are you looking at me?

204
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
Yes.

205
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,080
How close is it?

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,000
There is a bed, and a chair
is prepared right next to it.

207
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
It's from there.

208
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Do I have to look at it?

209
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,080
I don't know what it is.

210
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,280
But is it okay?

211
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't you want to see it?

212
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,200
In the first place,
swapping is meaningless.

213
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,490
I see.

214
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:50,420
I think it will take some time to get
used to it, so let's move away a little.

215
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,590
Yes, there are people like that.

216
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,280
Then, let's start from a little away.

217
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:55,660
Is it okay? Yes, it's okay.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,820


219
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,480
Is your wife okay
with that? It's okay.

220
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960


221
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,600
Is your wife okay with that?

222
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,040
Oh, we can go in as much as we want.

223
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,100
Okay, let's get started.

224
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,350
Do your best.

225
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,590
I'm a man who does it when I do it.

226
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,770
Are you all right?

227
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,970
Yes.

228
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,910
Mi-chan, do your best.

229
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,790
I'm embarrassed.

230
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,850
Why? It's all right.

231
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,260
I'm embarrassed.

232
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,060
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Let's drink tea.

234
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,840
Oh, my God!

235
00:16:08,540 --> 00:18:08,980
Oh, my God!

236
00:19:51,465 --> 00:20:09,280
Oh, my God! It's small.

237
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:42,400


238
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,216
※Because this video is taken
at the hospital, it was very

239
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:08,280
cold, so there may be a slight
difference in the sound quality.

240
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:11,681
※ I apologize to all the viewers who have
been waiting for this video to be released.

241
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm not a person who cries easily.

242
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,080
I'm not a person who gets emotional easily.

243
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm not a person who gets depressed easily.

244
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,140
It feels good.

245
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:55,650
Wow, it's great.

246
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,430
It really feels good.

247
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
I'm sorry.

248
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,250
I'm excited.

249
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,970
I can't.

250
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,370
Can I? Yes, you can.

251
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,730


252
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,050
Ah!! I'm sleepy.

253
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,230


254
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,370
What? You can't sleep?

255
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,371
I can't take it off.

256
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:57,860
I can't take it off.

257
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,480
Turn your hips.

258
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,820
Don't laugh, I'm sorry.

259
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:52,821
Don't cry, I'm so sorry.

260
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,640
Come on, don't cry.

261
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,360
Come on, don't cry.

262
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Are you feeling good? Yes, I am.

263
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,641
Are you feeling good? Yes, I am.

264
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,320
Are you feeling good? Yes, I am.

265
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,410
Oh, it's hot.

266
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920


267
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,898

He is breathing heavily.

270
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,400
Are you all right?

271
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,240
You have a lot of blood.

272
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
How is it? Can you
go in? It's all right.

273
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,120
Can I look at you from here?

274
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
From here?

275
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Yes.

276
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,560
OK, but don't you want to
look at me from close? It's OK.

277
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,840


278
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,940
Everyone is looking at you from close.

279
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Yes.

280
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,280
Well, if you are interested,
please come inside.

281
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:56,281
OK.

282
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,580
Sorry to keep you waiting.

283
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,980
Oh, no.

284
00:32:58,981 --> 00:32:59,220
Sorry.

285
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:00,221
I'm sorry.

286
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,220
Let's start.

287
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,740
May I? Of course.

288
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980


289
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,380
May I?

290
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,220
Your husband is a little far away.

291
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
Oh, really?

292
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Is he that far?

293
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Is it okay?

294
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:24,140
Well, he was saying
that from the beginning.

295
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:32,480
It's really hard.

296
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
It's okay.

297
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,180
You don't have to be shy.

298
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
It's hot.

299
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,200
Oh, oh, oh.

300
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,280
It's hot.

301
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Oh, oh, oh.

302
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:29,680
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's amazing.

303
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:30,761
The cat's voice is amazing.

304
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,570
Oh, is that so? It's amazing.

305
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,560


306
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,960
I was surprised.

307
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,520
It's amazing.

308
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:19,521
Good evening.

309
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,220
May I come in? It's amazing.

310
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,120
It looks fun.

311
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,600
Please come in.

312
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
It's okay.

313
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,320
Let's go in together.

314
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:45,980
Please come in.

315
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,500
Your husband is here.

316
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,480
Please come in.

317
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:23,790
Which one do you like
better, this one or this one?

318
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
I like this one.

319
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,770
Which one?

320
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,110
This is the first time I've ever seen
a baby drinking milk from a bottle.

321
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,750
It's amazing.

322
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,590
It's amazing.

323
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:48,610
It's amazing.

324
00:36:49,450 --> 00:37:28,780
It's amazing.

325
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,240
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

326
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,080
It's smaller than you.

327
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,140
I'm sorry.

328
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm sorry.

329
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
You are a dinosaur.

330
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,300
I'm sorry.

331
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
It's okay.

332
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:00,240
It's okay.

333
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
It's okay.

334
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,320
It's okay.

335
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
It's okay.

336
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,500
Mom, I'm sorry.

337
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,260
Mom, I'm sorry.

338
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm sorry.

339
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,720
I'm sorry.

340
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,800
It's been a while,
hasn't it? It's heavy.

341
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,900


342
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,080
Can you let me
touch it? Oh, I see.

343
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800


344
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,060
Wow, you are wearing a very cute pants.

345
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:24,420
Do you like it? Yes, I do.

346
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000


347
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,860
This is the first time
I've ever seen a baby cry.

348
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:08,810
The baby is crying.

349
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,690
The baby is crying.

350
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:13,691
The baby is crying.

351
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm sorry.

352
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,580
You are so mean.

353
00:40:45,770 --> 00:41:06,860
You are so mean.

354
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,700
What's wrong with you?

355
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:16,460
What's wrong with
you? Hit my butt.

356
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760


357
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,040
What? Hit my butt.

358
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240


359
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,140
Your butt?

360
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Yes.

361
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,540
More.

362
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,900
I love you.

363
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:45,920
I love you, too.

364
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,420
I love you.

365
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,190
You are here.

366
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,730
You are here.

367
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,420
It's good. It feels so good.

368
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,710
I'm so happy.

369
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,530
I'm so happy.

370
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:24,571
And you are so good at it.

371
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:26,410
You are so messy.

372
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,510
Turn your back to me.

373
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,671
Look at the face of Tama-san.

374
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,670
Hey, what are you
doing? I'm so excited.

375
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,490


376
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:38,830
You are excited, aren't you?

377
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,530
Yes.

378
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,910
Oh, it's hard.

379
00:45:53,450 --> 00:46:10,320
Can I throw it away?

380
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,340
I'll throw it away.

381
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:39,970
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

382
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:39,990
I'm so happy.

383
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:40,991
I'm so happy.

384
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:42,970
I'm so happy.

385
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:45,170
Hey, you.

386
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,530
Hey, you.

387
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:59,130
Hey, you.

388
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:00,790
It's fun.

389
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,830
Let's have fun until you get sad.

390
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,180
You have a strong body.

391
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,120
I understand.

392
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm scared.

393
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,730
I'm scared.

394
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,410
I'm scared.

395
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:26,590
I'm scared.

396
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,170
I'm scared.

397
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:36,470
This is my house.

398
00:48:49,775 --> 00:48:50,940
You are strong.

399
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,340
You are strong.

400
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,660
You are strong.

401
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:35,220
You are small.

402
00:49:39,280 --> 00:50:10,960
You are great.

403
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,540
More, more.

404
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,250
More?

405
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,360
Really?

406
00:50:52,940 --> 00:51:22,860
Do you want to
drink? That's good.

407
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,690


408
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,330
You're getting bigger.

409
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:40,690
I'm so happy.

410
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:41,510
I'm so happy.

411
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:42,830
I'm so happy.

412
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,230
If you're happy, that's good.

413
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,110
You must be tired.

414
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,010
It was fun, but I'm tired.

415
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,750
How do you feel?

416
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,270
Do you want to
try it? It felt good.

417
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,350
We did it.

418
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,410
Yes, we did.

419
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,210
We did it.

420
00:52:04,211 --> 00:52:04,630


421
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:05,990
Yes.

422
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,510
Then, the next step is to take this camera.

423
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:13,690
Oh, yes.

424
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:20,710
Take this camera, go on a
date, and do a lot of things.

425
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,170
Yes.

426
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:22,910
Please record it.

427
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,330
Record it?

428
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:24,770
Yes.

429
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,930
We will record it and release it as a DVD.

430
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,270
Thank you very much.

431
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:34,831
Thank you for your hard work.

432
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,570
How was your day today?

433
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,690
I'm glad I did it.

434
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,110
You had a lot of fun, didn't you?

435
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,710
How about you?

436
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,350
I wish she was really happy.

437
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,130
But it's hard.

438
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:58,770
I'm going to take this camera
and ask you to take a picture of me.

439
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:04,350
I'm going to put the picture on the
DVD and exchange it with the couple.

440
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,820
Sorry, I made you wait.

441
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Sorry, I made you wait.

442
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
It's been a while.

443
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,160
How are you? I'm fine.

444
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,040
I haven't been to
the beach recently.

445
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,080
How have you been?

446
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,180
I haven't been to the beach recently.

447
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,536
You haven't been to the beach recently.

448
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,840
Then, your body has become numb.

449
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,420
Yes.

450
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,560
What are you going to do?

451
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,420
I want to move my body.

452
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,060
Do you have anything you
want to do? I don't know.

453
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
I have no idea.

454
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,200
I'm so excited.

455
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880


456
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,540
Then, let's move your body.

457
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,541
Let's play baseball.

458
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,260
How about baseball?

459
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,600
Baseball?

460
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,080
Have you ever played baseball?

461
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,180
I'm not good at it.

462
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:58,700
Really?

463
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,680
But you just have to move your body.

464
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,620
You can change your mood.

465
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,100
You can hit the ball.

466
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,320
You can hit the ball.

467
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,700
You can shake the ball.

468
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,120
I can relieve my stress.

469
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:10,760
You can relieve your stress.

470
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,000
Are you going to play baseball?

471
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,360
Are your nails okay?

472
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,840
I think your nails are okay.

473
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:15,841
It's amazing.

474
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,040
I want to have sex.

475
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,620
Don't you have sex? Yes, I do.

476
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,820


477
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,980
You do, don't you?

478
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,100
I have a lot of sex.

479
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,260
It's amazing since then.

480
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,960
I know half of it.

481
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,080
It's 80km.

482
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,980
What? It's 80km.

483
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,780
It's fast.

484
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,280
Is it the slowest?

485
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,380
Well, let's see.

486
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,440
Oh, where is it? It says 70 kilograms.

487
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,160
Oh, what should I do?

488
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,060
It says 70 kilograms and 10 kilograms.

489
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,380
Well, let's do the slowest one.

490
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,040
The slowest one?

491
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,100
The slowest one.

492
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,470
Wait a minute.

493
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,690
Let's go in together.

494
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,400
Be careful.

495
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
Go inside.

496
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,880
What should I do with your bag?

497
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,020
Should I carry it?

498
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,520
What should I
do? It's dangerous.

499
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
No, no, no.

500
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,481
Carry it, carry it.

501
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,500
Thank you.

502
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:21,620
Like this? Yes, yes.

503
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,980
Put it in.

504
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,260


505
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,960
Have you ever shaken it?

506
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,960
Just a little bit.

507
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,820
Just a little bit? When you were a kid?

508
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Yes.

509
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,960
Then this is the lightest.

510
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,660
This? This is light.

511
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,840


512
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,380
Is this heavy?

513
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:37,800
How is it?

514
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,240
Is this heavy?

515
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Yes.

516
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,580
It doesn't go up at all.

517
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
It doesn't go up at all?

518
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
It doesn't go up at all.

519
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,620
The ball comes from there.

520
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:47,621
I'm going to throw it.

521
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,280
Don't swing it.

522
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:52,920
I'm scared.

523
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,921
I'll put money in it.

524
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Wait a minute.

525
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,660
Be careful.

526
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
Are you scared?

527
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,320
I'm afraid that the ball will hit me.

528
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,660
The ball will hit you.

529
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,900
How many times? About 20 times.

530
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,820


531
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,800
I can't swing it that much.

532
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:17,040
You don't have to hit it.

533
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,220
Let's go.

534
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,640
Get ready.

535
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,500
Be careful.

536
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,880
Don't worry. It won't come from there.

537
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,140
Let's go.

538
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,520
It's coming.

539
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,540
I'm coming!

540
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,720
I'm coming!

541
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,200
Wait a minute!

542
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,280
I hit it!

543
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,040
I'm scared!

544
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,500
I'm scared!

545
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,400
It's fast!

546
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
It's fast?

547
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,580
I'm scared!

548
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
I'm scared!

549
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:21,180
It's a nice fight.

550
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,140
I'm not good at it.

551
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,480
What should I do?

552
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,900
Are you sleeping? Let's hit 9.

553
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,820
Let's guess what it is.

554
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,760
If you get it right,

555
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,460
I'll give you a reward.

556
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,280
I'll give you a real bat.

557
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,920
A golden bat.

558
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,580
Wow!

559
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Wow!

560
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Wow!

561
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,880
You got a good one.

562
00:57:59,881 --> 00:58:01,480
It's hot.

563
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,660
It's hot, isn't it?

564
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,660
It's the first time.

565
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,980
It's still cold.

566
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,560
Isn't it enough?

567
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,120
What's this?

568
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
There's something inside.

569
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,640
It's an LCD.

570
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,100
It's amazing.

571
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,960
What's this?

572
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,220
I wonder what it is.

573
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,340
Shall we do it?

574
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,220
Shall we?

575
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,020
Shall we do it?

576
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,840
What's this?

577
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,560
What does it say? Gold? Gold.

578
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,020
Gold.

579
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,100


580
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200


581
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,100
I can't do it at all.

582
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,980
What should I do?

583
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,480
What should I do?

584
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,740
Should I lift it up?

585
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,080
Oh, I couldn't do it at all.

586
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,820
It's cute.

587
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,840
It's just the right size.

588
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,340
Right? Oh, no.

589
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,980


590
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,700
There is only one table.

591
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,480
No way.

592
00:58:56,481 --> 00:58:58,960
I messed it up.

593
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,100
It's OK.

594
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,160
Here?

595
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,620
Yes.

596
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,400
Like this.

597
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,520
A hint?

598
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,600
You are good at it.

599
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,440
Do you want to
try it? No, I'm good.

600
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
It's so fine.

601
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,260
It's good.

602
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,320


603
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,880
It's not crispy.

604
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,800
It's good.

605
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,040
It's sticky.

606
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:41,920
It's sticky.

607
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:42,600
It's thick.

608
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
It's sticky.

609
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,560
No, it's good.

610
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,620
You can eat it.

611
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,720
He ate it.

612
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,670
Let's go in.

613
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,950
Let's go this way.

614
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,670
Let's go.

615
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,470
It looks fancy.

616
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,390
It looks expensive.

617
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:07,750
Not at all.

618
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,130
Isn't it expensive? No, it's OK.

619
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,530


620
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,030
Is it OK? It's OK.

621
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,610
I have a lot of money.

622
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,870
I have a lot of money, so it's OK.

623
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,510
Then, I'll treat you.

624
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,650
Say anything you want.

625
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,630
Take a break?

626
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,990
Break?

627
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,650
In a white place.

628
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,380
What floor?

629
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,550
302.

630
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:59,130
I didn't press it.

631
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,550
Why? Oh, no.

632
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:01,730


633
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:02,850
I didn't press it.

634
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,670
This is not a maid.

635
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,130
Did you play such
a game? No, I didn't.

636
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:12,730
I'm worn out.

637
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,670
Here it is.

638
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,250
Let's get in.

639
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,430
Let's get in.

640
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:20,830


641
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,030
Can I go in? Yes, you can.

642
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,630
The moment you press the
button, the door will open.

643
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,070
Yes, yes, yes.

644
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:32,990
It's OK.

645
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,330
Get in.

646
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:42,210
It's a good room.

647
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,790
How do you feel?

648
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,630
Can I look around first?

649
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,380
Lady first? Lady first.

650
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:49,870


651
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,930
The room is big.

652
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,630
It's good.

653
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:01,870
I found something strange.

654
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,010
What is it? It's hot.

655
01:02:04,450 --> 01:03:30,060


656
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,620
Are you OK? Cool me down.

657
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,180


658
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,500
Cool you down?

659
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,340
I'll cool you down.

660
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,560
I'll cool you down.

661
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,230
I'll cool you down.

662
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,800
Really? Then get hot.

663
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,640
I'm happy even in my mouth.

664
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,010
I can't do it.

665
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,650
Unlike my husband, I can't do it.

666
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,360
That's a secret.

667
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:20,970
Really.

668
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,250
My husband does it normally.

669
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,850
Normally?

670
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,670
Do you like it?

671
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,110
Yes.

672
01:05:33,435 --> 01:05:34,435
I'm going to take a bath.

673
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:51,120
I'm going to wash my face with the sponge.

674
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,946
My face will be washed with
the condition that it is warm.

675
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:39,040
I'm wearing a very sullen outfit.

676
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,460
I want you to show me a little more.

677
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,360
I'll put it in for you.

678
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,080
Raise your legs.

679
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:37,081
It hurts.

680
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,550
It's coming.

681
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,810
It's over.

682
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,520
What's wrong? It's over.

683
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,580
I'm sorry.

684
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,120


685
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:07,420
I'm sorry for my baby.

686
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:23,560
I'm sorry for my baby.

687
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:38,570
I'm so hungry.

688
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,340
I feel so good.

689
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,341
It's too hot.

690
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,880
It's too hot.

691
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,670
It's too hot.

692
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:19,850
It's too hot.

693
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,150
I don't want to be in such a box.

694
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,480
You are in a box.

695
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,940
You are very much in a box.

696
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,680
No, I don't want to die.

697
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,760
You are in a box.

698
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,560
You are in a box.

699
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,200
Do you understand? Listen to me.

700
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,560


701
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,920
I don't want to die.

702
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,240
I don't want to die.

703
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:17,740
She is crying.

704
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,760
She is crying.

705
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,440
She is crying.

706
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:42,540
Please rub your belly.

707
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,060
Rub your belly.

708
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,740
Please rub your belly.

709
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:49,200
Please rub your belly.

710
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,040
I like that.

711
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
I'm watching you.

712
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,300
I want to go to the bathroom.

713
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,900
I feel sick.

714
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:04,010
I'm so sorry.

715
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,650
Please close the door.

716
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,140
I think I'm going to forget everything.

717
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,320
I can't stop crying.

718
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,940
Ouch! I'm so scared.

719
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:34,040


720
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:05,650
There is a statue of Godzilla
on the top of the building.

721
01:18:05,651 --> 01:18:06,731
Is it a statue of
Godzilla? Yes, it is.

722
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:12,050
It is a famous statue of
Godzilla on the top of the building.

723
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:14,770
Godzilla is on the top of the mountain.

724
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,750
Are you scared? I'm scared.

725
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,430


726
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,550
You are doing various things.

727
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,820
Is this your 50th first kiss?

728
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,200
Let's kiss 50 times here.

729
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,680
No.

730
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:44,300
Let's watch a movie.

731
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:45,396
Oh, we're going to see a movie.

732
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:45,860
We're going to see a movie.

733
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,400
That's right.

734
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,540
Let's go.

735
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Here it is.

736
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,880
Buy a ticket here.

737
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,820
Ticket

738
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,860
This Here you are.

739
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,300


740
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,240
It looks delicious.

741
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,840
It looks delicious.

742
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,560
What do you usually play with?

743
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,700
What do you usually play with?

744
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,240
What do I usually
play with? I can't drink.

745
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:33,700


746
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,100
I can't drink, but I like to drink.

747
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,340
Do you like the atmosphere?

748
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,640
Yes.

749
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,840
Are you alone?

750
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,980
No, I'm with a friend.

751
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:43,981
Are you his friend?

752
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,200
Is he a man? He is a man.

753
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,820
I see.

754
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,020


755
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,280
Do you have a lot of friends?

756
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,680
Yes.

757
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:54,940
It's hot.

758
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,060
Is it hot?

759
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,720
The movie was interesting,
wasn't it? Yes, it was.

760
01:19:57,721 --> 01:19:58,721


761
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:00,940
How was it?

762
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,740
It was cute, wasn't it?

763
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,940
By the way, I'm a surfer.

764
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,460


765
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,460
Is that so?

766
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,740
I like you, too.

767
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:09,800
Really?

768
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:10,980
Yes.

769
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:23,020
Actually, I haven't told anyone about this,
but there was no one in the sea at dusk.

770
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,398
So I went to the beach
for about 30 minutes

771
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:30,940
with my boyfriend I
was dating at that time.

772
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,740
Not your current husband?

773
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,500
No.

774
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,560
I was bleeding.

775
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,340
I was bleeding.

776
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,580
I was bleeding.

777
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,920
I was bleeding.

778
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,580
I was bleeding.

779
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,700
I was bleeding.

780
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,100
I was bleeding.

781
01:21:03,101 --> 01:21:03,120
I was bleeding.

782
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:03,140
I was bleeding.

783
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:03,220
I was bleeding.

784
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:03,300
I was bleeding.

785
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,320
I was bleeding.

786
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,400
Ah!

787
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,920
Do you still have it?

788
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,020
I did it in a cable car.

789
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:11,200
What?

790
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,820
In a cable car?

791
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:15,420
Yes.

792
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:16,820
How was it?

793
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:23,140
Well, when no one was holding it,

794
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,120
I don't know if there
was a security camera.

795
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,480
There must be a camera.

796
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:29,580
I wonder if there is.

797
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,060
I think so.

798
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:32,430
I did it in that.

799
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,540
You did it? Until the end?

800
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,260
Yes.

801
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,540
Were you naked?

802
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
No, I wasn't naked.

803
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,840
You were naked.

804
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,040
You were naked.

805
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,080
Yes, I was naked there, too.

806
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,360
You were naked.

807
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,520
Because I was shaking.

808
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,740
You were shaking a lot.

809
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,388
I'm not that kind of
person, but when I talked

810
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,400
to him, I felt like I
was getting dizzy.

811
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,800
I'm not that kind of person.

812
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,480
Where should we go?

813
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,080
Let's go over there.

814
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:18,950
Let's go.

815
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,420
I'm going to the hotel.

816
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,520
Can I eat here? Oh, I can't.

817
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,100
It's 3,000 yen.

818
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,540


819
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:54,710
I'm at the hotel.

820
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,770
I'm at the hotel.

821
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:58,970
Love ho!

822
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:00,290
Love ho! 5,4,3,2,1.

823
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:23,520
5,4,3,2,1.

824
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,040
Here you go.

825
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:27,041


826
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,540
Oh, it's the 7th floor.

827
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,340
This hotel uses an automatic system.

828
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:40,540
Please put your members, cards,
and your belongings in the card slot.

829
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:47,140
When you leave, please press the doorbell
at the front door and pay your fee.

830
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:48,581
Please put your hands on your waist.

831
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,480
Please put your hands on your waist.

832
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:11,830
You are so sexy.

833
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,730
Let's breathe.

834
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,290
Let's breathe.

835
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:39,520
【The sound of a baby eating.

836
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:46,790
】 Wow!

837
01:24:51,400 --> 01:25:06,940
You always attack me like this.

838
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:21,700
Do you want me to do it?

839
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,840
Wow!

840
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,320
Great!

841
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,060
Great! It's too bad.

842
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,980
It's too bad.

843
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,280


844
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,310
It's on the side and the back.

845
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:22,200
I have to go to the bathroom.

846
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:23,201
The water is boiling.

847
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,890
I'm gonna fall.

848
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:36,570
No!

849
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,450
I'm going to fall.

850
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:43,630
I'm going to fall.

851
01:30:56,180 --> 01:32:09,250
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

852
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:47,940
She is a cat that is very sensitive
to the sound of a vacuum cleaner.

853
01:32:48,380 --> 01:33:01,530
I'm sorry for the noise.

854
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:06,220
I'm sorry for the noise.

855
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,260
I'm sorry for the noise.

856
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:18,190
I'm sorry for the noise.

857
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:23,310
Oh my god!

858
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:24,630
Oh my god! It is made of silk.

859
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:27,130
Look!

860
01:35:27,131 --> 01:35:38,660
※This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

861
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:38,740
※This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

862
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,716
※This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

863
01:35:41,740 --> 01:36:03,620
※This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

864
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,280
※This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this.

865
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:15,800
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

866
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:18,760
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

867
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,000
Hurry up,Ten.

868
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,300
I feel good.

869
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,240
now I feel good

870
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:19,090
Oh, it feels good.

871
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:40,291
You don't have to put up with it.

872
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:41,930
You don't have to be stupid.

873
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,170
You are so distracted.

874
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,630
Show me your true self.

875
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:38,550
I'm sorry.

876
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:48,910
I'm sorry.

877
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,590
I'm sorry.

878
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:03,230
You're lying.

879
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:14,750
You're selfish.

880
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,210
You're amazing.

881
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:34,670
It's disgusting.

882
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:25,100
「」「」 I'll give you a massage.

883
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,880
I'll give you a massage.

884
01:41:32,881 --> 01:41:33,881
It feels good.

885
01:41:45,510 --> 01:42:09,200
It feels good.

886
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,380
You can spit it out.

887
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,700
A lot.

888
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:23,540
We are going to
have a party! I drank it.

889
01:43:23,541 --> 01:43:24,720
I drank it.

890
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:26,580


891
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:33,010
Yeah!

892
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:37,810
We are going to have a party!

893
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:41,150
Cheers! I'm so happy.

894
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:48,650


895
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:50,730
Congratulations.

896
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:52,070
Thank you.

897
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:53,770
It's delicious.

898
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,210
How do you like it?

899
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:58,610
It's like a hot spring.

900
01:43:59,090 --> 01:43:59,610
It's good.

901
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:01,490
We went to hot springs three times.

902
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,990
Yes, we did.

903
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:04,670
It's delicious.

904
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:08,890
We did good things.

905
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:10,630
What did you eat?

906
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:12,050
Abalone and sea urchin.

907
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:13,670
What did you eat?

908
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:17,210
I want to eat abalone.

909
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:21,360
I want to eat abalone.

910
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:23,150
I want to eat abalone.

911
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,490
I want to eat abalone.

912
01:44:25,491 --> 01:44:26,450
I want to eat abalone.

913
01:44:26,451 --> 01:44:30,310
I'm sorry.

914
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:40,190
We are going to do swapping.

915
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,551
Today, we're going to play a game.

916
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:42,830
Are you ready? Yes, I am.

917
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:44,330


918
01:44:47,435 --> 01:44:48,526
I brought this from the countryside.

919
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:49,050
From the countryside?

920
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:51,026
Oh, this is the one you can
see in Love4, right? Yes, it is.

921
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:52,050


922
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:55,150
You can use it as much as you want.

923
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:56,910
You don't have to be shy.

924
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,770
There's no time limit.

925
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:01,466
You can use it as much as you want.

926
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:02,770
I'm so excited.

927
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:05,190
You can use it as much as you want.

928
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:07,690
Oh, my gosh.

929
01:45:07,691 --> 01:45:09,350
I think it's too big for me.

930
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:11,810
Are you OK? It's big.

931
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:13,730


932
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:18,850
Let's compare the face.

933
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:25,570
It's shuffle time.

934
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:27,970
We have to shuffle.

935
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:32,170
Maru-san looks so energetic.

936
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:34,330
Did it pop?

937
01:45:34,331 --> 01:45:35,570
What's going on? Look, look.

938
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:37,250
I'm having fun.

939
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:39,170


940
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,410
Which one?

941
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:43,830
What was that?

942
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:55,630
You're too drunk.

943
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,130
Let's start.

944
01:45:58,490 --> 01:45:59,870
Go ahead, everyone.

945
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:00,871
Here you are.

946
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:03,210
It's easy to eat,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

947
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:05,731
It's easy to eat.

948
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,430
Look at this.

949
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:42,340
It's wonderful,
isn't it? Look at this.

950
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,640
It's wonderful.

951
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,230
Look at this.

952
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:53,220
It's amazing.

953
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:54,221
Look at this.

954
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,900


955
01:46:58,670 --> 01:47:00,520
It's wonderful, isn't it?

956
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,660
I can't stop laughing.

957
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:12,000
Let's start the
video! You are so big.

958
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:37,760
I envy you.

959
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:39,600
What?

960
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,380
You are so cute.

961
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:52,780
You are so shy.

962
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:13,861
I'm going to give you a massage.

963
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:19,620
Do you feel good?

964
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:22,900
You are a brave girl.

965
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,860
Look at this.

966
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:29,840
This is her pillow.

967
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:33,060
This is her pillow.

968
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:39,240
I'm going to tell you that
you can sleep next to me.

969
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,840
Do you feel good? Look at me.

970
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:47,860


971
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:22,470
The baby is crying.

972
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:31,830
The baby is crying.

973
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:09,400
This is a video of a baby
who was born in the morning.

974
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:15,580
The baby's mother, who is a
mother of three, is the first child.

975
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,800
The baby's mother, who is the
second child, is the first child.

976
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:26,660
The baby's mother, who is
the third child, is the first child.

977
01:51:26,661 --> 01:51:27,661
What?

978
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,400
How can you say such
a thing? Yes, yes, yes.

979
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:32,860
Oh, no, no, no.

980
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,460
Oh, no, no, no.

981
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,160


982
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:45,280
What's the matter?

983
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,820
You're crying again, aren't you?

984
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,930
A little? No, no, no.

985
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:51,050
Look.

986
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:52,070
A little.

987
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:53,530
Look.

988
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:53,870
A little.

989
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:55,070


990
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:11,002
In the past, Kuronoko used to tell
us that she loves us so much, and she

991
01:52:11,014 --> 01:52:15,830
loves us so much, that she and
Kuronoko want to give everything to her.

992
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:21,870
So no matter what, I
want to be with Kuronoko.

993
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:43,050
I'm sorry.

994
01:52:43,051 --> 01:52:44,051
What's going on?

995
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:45,470
Which one is the fraud?

996
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:46,590
Which one is the
fraud? I'm sorry.

997
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:50,210
I'm sorry.

998
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:55,850
I'm sorry.

999
01:52:55,950 --> 01:52:56,950
I'm sorry.

1000
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,530


1001
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:23,835
The day when I first saw
the baby, I thought it was

1002
01:53:23,847 --> 01:53:24,400
a baby who was in the
hospital, but I was wrong.

1003
01:53:24,401 --> 01:53:26,236
The baby was crying, but I was worried
that the baby was in a bad condition.

1004
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:29,860
I was worried that he was sick,
but I was relieved that he was fine.

1005
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:36,200
You were very gentle.

1006
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,921
You are getting sensitive.

1007
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:45,310
Let's see how wet you are.

1008
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:49,210
How wet are you? You are wet.

1009
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:50,230


1010
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:53,670
You are wet, aren't you? Great.

1011
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:58,770
You are so wet.

1012
01:53:59,145 --> 01:54:00,145


1013
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:02,450
I've never been so wet.

1014
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:04,270
What's wrong?

1015
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:05,710
Did you spill it?

1016
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:08,510
Huh?

1017
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,540
Is it our baby?

1018
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:10,930
Is it our baby?

1019
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:13,410
We haven't opened it yet.

1020
01:54:13,411 --> 01:54:14,411
The sound is coming out.

1021
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:16,210
Right?

1022
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:18,810
The sound is coming out.

1023
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,810
Oh, it's amazing.

1024
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,970
The sound is loud.

1025
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:25,610
It's amazing.

1026
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:30,790
It's amazing.

1027
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:33,610
It's the same as before.

1028
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:34,310
That's right.

1029
01:54:34,311 --> 01:54:35,311
Do you want to play it?

1030
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:38,850
Where is the red one?

1031
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,310
The one you were eating.

1032
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,490
Do you want to go to the lower house?

1033
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:46,890
You want to go to the
lower house? Let's go.

1034
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:48,330


1035
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:56,611
Do you want to go to the abbey?

1036
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,720
Do you want to go?

1037
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:03,960
I'm going to put a cream on his head.

1038
01:55:03,961 --> 01:55:05,360
Look at him.

1039
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:12,020
I put a cream on his head.

1040
01:55:12,021 --> 01:55:15,300
Can I put it on your head?

1041
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:19,940
I'm going to put it on your head.

1042
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:31,660
Do you feel good?

1043
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,040
Do you want me to give you a massage?

1044
01:55:46,240 --> 01:56:03,110
I'll give you a massage.

1045
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:09,440
I'll give you a massage.

1046
01:56:09,441 --> 01:56:10,441
Look!

1047
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,840
Oh!

1048
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:17,100
I was surprised!

1049
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:18,240
You are not there!

1050
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:19,940
You are not there!

1051
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,440
It's already like this.

1052
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:22,400
Then, look! I will.

1053
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:24,080
..

1054
01:56:24,081 --> 01:56:25,161
I will leave this a little.

1055
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,280
Wow! You look happy.

1056
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:31,620
Yes, it is.

1057
01:56:31,621 --> 01:56:33,000


1058
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,660
You are smiling.

1059
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,141
Aiko, you look like a cherry blossom.

1060
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:45,980
Your face is bigger.

1061
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:50,620
I can't move.

1062
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:57,760
Your wife is very fat.

1063
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,260
How do you feel?

1064
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:14,280
My voice is gone.

1065
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,380
It's about time.

1066
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:25,720
I see.

1067
01:57:25,721 --> 01:57:26,721
What do you mean?

1068
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:33,480
Actually, we are not in that
kind of relationship anymore.

1069
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:36,740
We are not dating anymore.

1070
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:38,500
Oh, I see.

1071
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:40,780
I see.

1072
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:43,840
Are you two a
couple? Yes, we are.

1073
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,620
If so, we are.

1074
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:48,300
..

1075
01:57:48,301 --> 01:57:48,760
May I? Yes, please.

1076
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:49,920


1077
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:16,620
You are too impatient.

1078
01:58:36,050 --> 01:58:37,050
No!

1079
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:38,770
No!

1080
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:39,810
No!

1081
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:43,720
No!

1082
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:44,100
No!

1083
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:45,540
No!

1084
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:48,740
No!

1085
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:50,620
No!

1086
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,520
No!

1087
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:53,880
No!

1088
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,580
No!

1089
01:58:54,581 --> 01:58:55,581
Look at my nipples.

1090
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:43,700
Look at my nipples.

1091
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:31,101
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

1092
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:57,980
It's hard for me to watch.

1093
02:00:57,981 --> 02:01:00,460
It's hard for me to watch.

1094
02:01:00,461 --> 02:01:02,920
It's hard for me to watch.

1095
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,820
It's hard for me to watch.

1096
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:25,810
I'm sorry.

1097
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:39,090
What's this?

1098
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:42,530
I thought it was my wife's hand.

1099
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:45,130
It's my hand.

1100
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:46,330
You grabbed your husband's hand.

1101
02:01:46,331 --> 02:01:48,230
Oh my god!

1102
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:52,430
Oh my god!

1103
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:55,030
Oh my god!

1104
02:01:55,150 --> 02:01:59,670
Oh my god!

1105
02:02:54,400 --> 02:03:03,040
What are you doing?

1106
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,440
You are getting heavier.

1107
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:09,340
What are you doing?

1108
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:14,880
You can't take it out, can you?

1109
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,200
The baby is crying.

1110
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,680
The baby is crying.

1111
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:47,300
The baby is crying.

1112
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:07,520
I was injured and my finger was cut.

1113
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:20,280
I took medicine, but
I couldn't stop crying.

1114
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:34,660
I got a lot of workout,
so I couldn't stop crying.

1115
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:51,850
Let's taste it.

1116
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:54,010
One by one.

1117
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:56,230
You can do it because you are alive.

1118
02:04:58,070 --> 02:05:05,980
Is it okay?

1119
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,160
You can do it because you are alive.

1120
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:06,660
I'm sorry.

1121
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:10,580
Can I take this out?

1122
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:38,850
I'll take it out.

1123
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:43,550
Ouch!

1124
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:45,210
Ouch!

1125
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,580
I can't stand it anymore.

1126
02:07:40,581 --> 02:07:41,581
I can't stand it either.

1127
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:44,520
Lie down.

1128
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:51,880
We look forward to your
comments in the summary section!

1129
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:54,140
We look forward to your comments
in the summary section! It's cold.

1130
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:41,110
It's cold. It's cold.

1131
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:53,960
Thank you.
