1
72.91 --> 74.91
 You are sleepy.

2
74.91 --> 76.91
 It is true.

3
76.91 --> 78.91
 You are tired.

4
78.91 --> 80.91
 Yes I am.

5
80.91 --> 82.91
 Can I have your name please?

6
82.91 --> 84.91
 My name is Miho Ishikawa.

7
84.91 --> 86.91
 Are you an actor?

8
86.91 --> 88.91
 No, I am not.

9
88.91 --> 90.91
 Thank you for your time.

10
90.91 --> 92.91
 As for me, I had a day off.

11
92.91 --> 94.91
 You come here from noon?

12
94.91 --> 96.91
 Yes.

13
96.91 --> 98.91
 A day off?

14
98.91 --> 100.91
 Yes.

15
1314.90 --> 1318.90
 I couldn't do it, so I thought I should do it in a fun way.

16
1318.90 --> 1324.90
 To be honest, I couldn't become a real woman.

17
1324.90 --> 1328.90
 But I could do it anyway.

18
1328.90 --> 1330.90
 Do you think so?

19
1330.90 --> 1332.90
 It doesn't matter. As long as it's fun.

20
1332.90 --> 1336.90
 I really think so.

21
1410.88 --> 1412.88
 I can't go to the small one.

22
1412.88 --> 1414.88
 It's okay.

23
1414.88 --> 1416.88
 What should I do?

24
1416.88 --> 1424.61
 I like eggplants.

25
1424.61 --> 1426.61
 I'll take it.

26
1426.61 --> 1433.39
 Vegetable pork and eggplants.

27
1433.39 --> 1435.39
 I like tomatoes the most.

28
1435.39 --> 1437.39
 I like eggplants.

29
1437.39 --> 1439.39
 I'm tired.

30
1468.37 --> 1477.12
 I just cut it.

31
1488.18 --> 1509.63
 Eggplants, peppers, and carrots.

32
1509.63 --> 1511.63
 It's fashionable.

33
1511.63 --> 1513.63
 It's very fashionable.

34
1513.63 --> 1517.07
 It's beautiful.

35
1517.07 --> 1519.07
 It's beautiful.

36
1521.07 --> 1523.07
 I'll put it here.

37
1540.02 --> 1542.02
 Do you have champagne?

38
1542.02 --> 1544.02
 Champagne?

39
1547.84 --> 1549.84
 Let's have a toast.

40
1549.84 --> 1551.84
 Let's drink.

41
1551.84 --> 1553.84
 May I?

42
1565.65 --> 1567.65
 I'll do it properly.

43
1569.65 --> 1571.65
 It's a glass.

44
1579.36 --> 1583.36
 There were a lot of people outside until a while ago.

45
1587.36 --> 1589.36
 There were a lot of people on the train.

46
1589.36 --> 1591.36
 It was amazing, wasn't it?

47
1591.36 --> 1593.36
 Suddenly, there were a lot of people.

48
1595.36 --> 1597.36
 It's been a long time since I drank champagne.

49
1597.36 --> 1599.36
 It's been a while.

50
1606.67 --> 1611.39
 How can I open this?

51
1613.39 --> 1622.27
 Can you open it?

52
1624.27 --> 1626.27
 I can't.

53
1626.27 --> 1628.27
 Do you want to put it in?

54
1628.27 --> 1647.71
 I'll open it.

55
1651.71 --> 1653.71
 It sounds good.

56
1672.90 --> 1674.90
 I'll give you a glass of rice.

57
1674.90 --> 1676.90
 Thank you.

58
1680.90 --> 1682.90
 I'm nervous.

59
1689.17 --> 1691.17
 Let's have a toast.

60
1691.17 --> 1693.17
 To our meeting.

61
1693.17 --> 1695.17
 To our meeting?

62
1695.17 --> 1697.17
 Cheers.

63
1709.84 --> 1719.49
 I'm a little tired today.

64
1721.49 --> 1723.49
 I walked a lot.

65
1727.49 --> 1729.49
 I walked a lot.

66
1729.49 --> 1732.93
 What kind of person are you?

67
1734.93 --> 1736.93
 Have we met before?

68
1736.93 --> 1738.93
 No.

69
1742.93 --> 1747.14
 You talk a lot.

70
1747.14 --> 1749.14
 Do I?

71
1749.14 --> 1751.14
 You talk a lot.

72
1755.15 --> 1757.15
 You talk a lot.

73
1757.15 --> 1759.15
 Do I?

74
1759.15 --> 1761.15
 I'm proud of you.

75
1763.15 --> 1765.15
 Do I?

76
1765.15 --> 1767.15
 Wait a minute.

77
1767.15 --> 1769.15
 I'm a man of few words.

78
1769.15 --> 1771.15
 What was that?

79
1773.15 --> 1775.15
 I'm from Kansai.

80
1775.15 --> 1777.15
 I'm from Kansai.

81
1777.15 --> 1779.15
 I see.

82
1781.15 --> 1783.15
 I'm a man of few words.

83
1783.15 --> 1785.15
 You imitated my face.

84
1789.15 --> 1791.15
 Have we met before?

85
1791.15 --> 1793.15
 I saw you on Twitter.

86
1804.34 --> 1806.34
 I see.

87
1812.34 --> 1814.34
 Do you want to cook a meal?

88
1820.29 --> 1822.29
 I'm still hungry.

89
1822.29 --> 1824.29
 Do you still have Takoyaki?

90
1824.29 --> 1826.29
 No.

91
1826.29 --> 1828.29
 I'm still hungry.

92
1836.42 --> 1838.42
 I had many plans during the date.

93
1840.42 --> 1842.42
 I can't cook.

94
1844.42 --> 1846.42
 I want you to bully me.

95
1852.42 --> 1854.42
 I want you to bully me.

96
1854.42 --> 1856.42
 Really?

97
1856.42 --> 1858.42
 Yes.

98
1866.13 --> 1868.13
 I'm sorry.

99
1868.13 --> 1870.13
 By the way, do you poop often?

100
1870.13 --> 1872.13
 People won't notice it.

101
1872.13 --> 1876.13
 We can't notice most if you poop outside.

102
1884.13 --> 1892.56
 You're nice to me today.

103
1894.56 --> 1896.56
 Is this really so?

104
1896.56 --> 1898.56
 You pooped suddenly.

105
1898.56 --> 1900.56
 I didn't pee outside.

106
2026.45 --> 2029.45
 Do you like kissing?

107
2029.45 --> 2038.88
 I do.

108
2038.88 --> 2041.88
 Why do you kiss me so often?

109
2041.88 --> 2044.88
 Because you are beautiful.

110
2061.33 --> 2063.33
 That's weird.

111
2063.33 --> 2065.33
 I make a noise.

112
2066.33 --> 2072.11
 Do you make a noise when you kiss me?

113
2074.81 --> 2078.12
 I make a noise even if I don't kiss you.

114
6373.54 --> 6378.54
 I feel like you're touching me.

115
6378.54 --> 6380.54
 It's fresh.

116
6380.54 --> 6382.54
 Am I not good at it?

117
6382.54 --> 6384.54
 No, no.

118
6384.54 --> 6386.54
 It's like,

119
6386.54 --> 6388.54
 you know,

120
6388.54 --> 6390.54
 Chisho Choyu-san,

121
6390.54 --> 6392.54
 pfft, pfft.

122
6392.54 --> 6394.54
 Is it okay here?

123
6394.54 --> 6407.27
 I haven't touched you yet.

124
6407.27 --> 6409.27
 I'm touching around you.

125
6409.27 --> 6411.27
 Like a bamboo.

126
6411.27 --> 6413.27
 I'm kidding.

127
6413.27 --> 6416.27
 It's my prediction.

128
6416.27 --> 6422.27
 I want to eat something good.

129
6422.27 --> 6424.27
 Wait.

130
6424.27 --> 6426.27
 What?

131
6426.27 --> 6429.27
 Right, let's go for ramen.

132
6429.27 --> 6431.27
 I want to eat ramen.

133
6431.27 --> 6433.27
 I suddenly want to eat it.

134
6433.27 --> 6435.27
 There's no ramen.

135
6435.27 --> 6437.27
 Let's go somewhere nearby.

136
6437.27 --> 6439.27
 To eat?

137
6598.92 --> 6609.53
 Is that Mako?

138
6609.53 --> 6611.53
 That's Kondo.

139
6611.53 --> 6615.82
 Kondo?

140
6615.82 --> 6633.34
 It's not good.

141
6633.34 --> 6641.62
 I see.

142
6641.62 --> 6642.62
 Ramen?

143
6642.62 --> 6643.62
 Ramen.

144
6643.62 --> 6644.62
 Ramen?

145
6644.62 --> 6645.62
 There is a ramen shop nearby.

146
6645.62 --> 6649.62
 I think there is a place open.

147
6651.62 --> 6660.79
 Eat ramen.

148
6660.79 --> 6706.54
 I'm preparing.

149
8927.47 --> 8938.53
 Oh, no.

150
8938.53 --> 8961.46
 I'm sorry.

151
8961.46 --> 8963.46
 It was so delicious.

152
8963.46 --> 8965.46
 I was impressed by you.

153
8965.46 --> 8967.46
 Really?

154
8967.46 --> 8973.17
 I wrote,

155
8973.17 --> 8979.46
 Don't say too much.

156
8979.46 --> 8985.78
 I was impressed.

157
8987.78 --> 8989.78
 It was so good.

158
8989.78 --> 9001.14
 I should have ordered rice.

159
9003.14 --> 9005.14
 You should have.

160
9007.14 --> 9009.14
 I can't stop.

161
9014.14 --> 9016.14
 You don't wipe your sweat.

162
9016.14 --> 9018.14
 I can't stop.

163
9025.28 --> 9027.28
 I'll do it again.

164
9029.28 --> 9031.28
 I'm standing.

165
9031.28 --> 9033.28
 You're standing.

166
9036.28 --> 9038.28
 Really?

167
9039.28 --> 9041.28
 I'll do it again.

168
9050.15 --> 9052.15
 Wait a minute.

169
9055.15 --> 9057.15
 I'll do it again.

170
9060.15 --> 9062.15
 No, no, no.

171
9064.15 --> 9066.15
 Don't move.

172
9066.15 --> 9068.15
 It's dangerous.

173
9068.15 --> 9070.15
 I'll do it again.

174
9074.15 --> 9076.15
 I can't wipe my sweat.

175
9078.15 --> 9080.15
 Let me sleep.

176
9087.15 --> 9089.15
 Do you want to sleep?

177
9089.15 --> 9091.15
 Let me sleep.

178
9093.15 --> 9095.15
 I can't sleep so easily.

179
9100.66 --> 9185.76
 Good morning.

180
9186.76 --> 9191.03
 Good morning.

181
9194.03 --> 9196.03
 It's morning.

182
9197.03 --> 9199.03
 Good morning.

183
9245.42 --> 9246.42
 It's morning.

184
9246.42 --> 9249.42
 You didn't notice me?
