1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,280
Where is the child?

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,030
I asked him to go to school after school.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,390
Then, until about 6 o'clock.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,550
From boring daily life to non-daily life.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,850
Welcome.

6
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,084
Last week, I was
invited by Miki, a friend of

7
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,876
my mother, and came
here for the first time.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,510
I'm glad you came.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,190
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,390
What about the other
day? Here you are.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,170


12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,460
Would you like something to drink?

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,750
Water? Thank you.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,490
Here you are.

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,570


16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,390
Last time, I ran away just
because he hugged me.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,650
I was surprised and ran away from the
pleasure that I had never experienced.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,240
Did you do it with your husband
after you got home the other day?

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,670
Yes.

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,690
I do it right away and
start with a dramatic story.

21
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,490
Aoi is serious.

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,743
But, you know, I
thought it was hard to do

23
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:11,070
post-processing because
there was medicine left.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Processing?

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,330
Sexual desire processing.

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,150
Your words are vulgar.

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,211
You can't be popular with
women just because you're rich.

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,076
Oh, it's okay.
You don't have to be popular.

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,900
It's a problem if you have a strange
feeling of love with your father.

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,230
Is that so?

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,010
In fact, it was hard to
have sexual desire left.

32
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,331
It was hard for me to live alone.

33
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:33,290
That's why I went back to my daily life.

34
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,270
I stepped in again.

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,630
I know it's a road I can't go back.

36
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,210
What are you going to do?

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,050
It's the same as the last time.

38
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:55,840
Don't be nervous.

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,460
Show me your tongue.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,480
Show me your tongue.

41
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:21,481
I love you.

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,191
Isn't it different from the
medicine I took the other day?

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,361
No, it should be the same.

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,070
Is it the same?

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,170
I'm very nervous.

46
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,550
Maybe you're relaxed today.

47
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,011
You were nervous the other
day, weren't you? I'm sorry.

48
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,410


49
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,190
You're quite tall.

50
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,710
I'm not.

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,670
I can't tell the difference
between you and me.

52
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,810
I see.

53
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,970
Hey!

54
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,470
What is this?

55
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,710
Well,

56
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,410
I'll give you a massage.

57
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,270
I'm not good at it.

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,670
Please put it on the counter.

59
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,610
I got it.

60
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,130
Enjoy it.

61
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,510
Relax.

62
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,410
You enjoy it, too.

63
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,790
Of course.

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
I broke it.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,020
Don't worry.

67
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,021
Are you okay?

68
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Is it good? It's good.

69
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820


70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
The water is good.

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
The water is good.

72
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,930
The water is good.

73
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:16,680
You got used to it.

74
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:19,605
I got used to it.

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:32,410
Otherwise, your body will be a mess.

76
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,140
A mess.

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,170
Baki-baki.

78
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,090
Baki-baki?

79
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,650
Yes.

80
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,970
Baki-baki?

81
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,650
Are you going to be Baki-baki?

82
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,050
I'm going to be Baki-baki.

83
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,290
That's also Baki-baki.

84
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,790
Yes, that's also Baki-baki.

85
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,070
That's also Baki-baki.

86
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,590
But I was really happy that you came today.

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,830
It tickles.

88
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:01,710
It tickles?

89
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,110
I feel ticklish.

90
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,110
Your hair is tangled.

91
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,310
I just touched your hair.

92
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,170
I know.

93
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,770
It feels good to be touched.

94
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,730
You look beautiful today.

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm sure this medicine is
different from the previous one.

96
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Nothing has changed.

97
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,220
It's just a little dark.

98
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:22,160
I just touched you, but
I can't feel it so much.

99
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
You have beautiful legs.

100
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,300
You sat next to me.

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,840
My hands moved on their own.

102
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,020
It's amazing, isn't
it? It's amazing.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,880
It's amazing.

104
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180


105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Your whole body is
like running electricity.

106
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,820
Are you running
electricity? It's amazing.

107
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580


108
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,100
I can't remember anything.

109
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,360
It's okay. You'll forget.

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
Everyone forgets.

111
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,531
You'll be a good mother from tomorrow.

112
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I was surprised.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
I was really surprised.

114
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,350
I can't do that.

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,030
My ears hurt.

116
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,970
I can't do that, either.

117
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,430
I can't do that, either.

118
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,130
〔Painful moaning〕 There.

119
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,131
..

120
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,750
〔Mouth open〕

121
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,180
Let's open your eyes.

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Here.

123
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,180
How does it feel to be on top
of your clothes? It feels great.

124
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,370


125
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,530
You are so beautiful.

126
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,970
I'm so happy.

127
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,550
I can't believe that you are a child.

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,010
Oh, my God.

129
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,370
I feel it.

130
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,930
Oh, my God.

131
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,550
What do you want me to do?

132
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,280
I want you to mess up my hair.

133
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,230
I want to be more like Miku Miku.

134
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,420
Miku Miku? Miku Miku.

135
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,040


136
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,220
Let's start from here.

137
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Wow, amazing.

138
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
It's flat.

139
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,300
Oh, it's flat.

140
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Flat.

141
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,060
Oh, it's flat.

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
My nipples are flat.

143
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,500
You're not touching at all.

144
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,650
Don't make me so embarrassed.

145
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,030
I might hurt you.

146
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,710
Don't make me so embarrassed.

147
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,450
Come on.

148
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:43,710
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,700
You have beautiful boobs.

150
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,300
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,780
Ah, it feels so good.

152
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,960
Ah, there's a lot of electricity running.

153
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:35,810
I can't take it anymore.

154
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,770
Ah, it feels so good.

155
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Are you okay?

156
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,320
Why don't you take off your clothes?

157
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,220
Because it's hot.

158
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,000
Wow, it's amazing.

159
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
How far is the sky?

160
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,940
Wow, it's amazing.

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,100
It's like a dream.

162
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,101
It's a slumber.

163
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,880
It's a slumber, slumber, slumber.

164
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
That's right.

165
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,260
If it was usual, it would be like this.

166
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:06,320
What did you just say?

167
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,340
If it was usual, it would be like this.

168
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,420
Yes, that's right.

169
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,960
What will happen if you cry?

170
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,720
I think it's amazing.

171
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,300
Don't tease me.

172
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,510
Oh, my God.

173
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Oh, my God.

174
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:55,050
You're dirty.

175
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,990
I want you to do a lot more.

176
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
How?

177
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,180
I want you to do a lot more.

178
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,250
I want you to do a lot more.

179
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,150
It's already messed up.

180
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,090
It's already messed up.

181
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,950
It's sticky.

182
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,951
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,630
Oh, my god.

184
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm so scared.

185
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,030
Oh, my god.

186
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,310
Oh, my god.

187
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,690
No, I can't.

188
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,690
I'm so tired.

189
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,630
I'm just moving slowly like this.

190
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:47,631
I can't do it.

191
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,850
I'm going crazy.

192
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
I can't do it.

193
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,100
I'm going to die soon.

194
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,650
I'm going crazy.

195
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,790
It's so weird.

196
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,710
I just put it in a little.

197
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,090
It's totally different from
the medicine before.

198
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,970
It can't be the same.

199
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh, no.

200
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh, no.

201
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,120
Oh, no.

202
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,960
I love you.

203
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,480
I love you so much.

204
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,481
I love you.

205
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,060
You haven't been licked yet.

206
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,800
I haven't been licked yet.

207
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,080
I want you to be licked a lot.

208
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,190
I feel sorry for you.

209
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,680
I want you to be licked a lot.

210
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,940
I'm doing my best to take care of you.

211
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,360
About the house?

212
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,520
What was it? Your husband.

213
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,390


214
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
My husband?

215
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Which one was it?

216
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Was I there?

217
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,960
Forget about it now.

218
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:12,880
I want to go.

219
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
Let's go.

220
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Let's go there.

221
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
Let's go.

222
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,650
Ah...

223
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,650
I can't do it!

224
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,390
I can't do it! I'll do it.

225
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,250


226
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,780
I want you to be kissed by me.

227
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,920
Uhh….

228
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,620
I want to be kissed by you.

229
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,040
I want you to be kissed by me.

230
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,340
I want to be kissed by you.

231
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:32,480
Your skin is very sticky.

232
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Your skin is sticky.

233
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,440
You have to remove your chakras properly.

234
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,140
Oh, I forgot.

235
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:48,141
It hurts.

236
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,580
Why are you doing
this to me? It's all right.

237
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,020


238
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,740
I'm going to take care of you.

239
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,920
Please take care of me.

240
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Wow.

241
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,900
It feels good.

242
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:10,384
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

243
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:21,296
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm

244
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,840
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry.

245
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I feel good.

246
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:38,590
I'm going to go.

247
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,990
Oh, it feels so good.

248
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,510
It's going, it's going,
it's going, it's going.

249
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:09,511
Oh, it's going.

250
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,010
What a way of life.

251
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
I can't do it anymore.

252
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,340
I can't do it anymore.

253
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,820
I want you to do something for me tomorrow.

254
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,880
I want you to do something for me tomorrow.

255
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:02,881
Come on.

256
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,660
Get up.

257
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,560
Come on.

258
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,220
Rub your face.

259
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:34,270
Rub your tongue.

260
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,690
I can't do it.

261
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,630
※I'm sorry.

262
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:06,631
It feels good.

263
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,950
It feels good.

264
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,530
I hate you!

265
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, no! I'm so nervous.

266
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm so nervous.

267
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680


268
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:42,350
No, please continue.

269
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,930
Oh, my! I can't do it.

270
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080


271
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:17,110
You are good at playing with it.

272
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,290
I want to play with it.

273
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,410
I want to play with it.

274
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,870
Do you want to
see it? Yes, I do.

275
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,050
Let me see it.

276
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,090


277
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,510
OK.

278
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,920
My husband is not here.

279
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Who is he?

280
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,640
Who is he?

281
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,600
Is he your boyfriend?

282
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,180
I don't think so.

283
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,650
I'm so happy to see you, Ochinchi.

284
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,530
Wow, you are shining.

285
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,070
You are hard.

286
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,890
You are hard.

287
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,990
You are really hard.

288
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,330
You are beautiful, so I became hard.

289
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,330
I'm glad.

290
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,790
The day you made it hard.

291
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,000
You smell so bad.

292
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
You're a pervert.

293
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,060
Wow, you're licking a ball.

294
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,540
You're licking a gold ball.

295
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,480
Wow, wow, wow.

296
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:38,500
Ah, something is coming out.

297
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,165
It's the same as you.

298
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,440
When I listen to the sound of the
wind, it comes out more and more.

299
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,380
Then, I'll make it more sound.

300
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,840
It smells good.

301
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:22,910
It's very good.

302
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,610
You like to lick your penis.

303
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:39,811
Do you like licking
your feet? Yes, I do.

304
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,770


305
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,600
If you don't like it,
you can't lick it so well.

306
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,940
When did you lick your feet?

307
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,580
When was it?

308
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,820
I think it was a month or two ago.

309
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,540
You don't remember? No, I don't.

310
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,260


311
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,760
Did you want to lick your feet?

312
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:09,801
Did you want to eat a lot?

313
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,380
Yes, I wanted to eat a lot.

314
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,420
It feels good.

315
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:23,760
It feels good.

316
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,820
It feels good.

317
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,820
Ah...

318
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Wow...

319
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,960
That's a nice sound.

320
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,861
Wow... Crackle, crackle.

321
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm glad.

322
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,720
Wow...

323
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,340
You have a lot of pus in your mouth.

324
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,180
That's amazing.

325
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,520
Oh, no, no, no, no.

326
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,140
ーOh, my god.

327
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
ーOh, my god.

328
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,000
ーI'm coming.

329
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,340
It's no good.
If you do it too hard, it'll come out.

330
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,290
You've got a lot.

331
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,291
It's been a long time.

332
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,470
30 minutes left until my
daughter goes back to school.

333
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,790
Until then, I go back
to being a serious mom.

334
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:15,390
I go back to my daily
life from my non-daily life.

335
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,340
I have to go back to my daily life,

336
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,980
but the remaining days of pleasure
bring me back to my non-daily life.

337
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,300
Bring me back.

338
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,880
Come on, Dopa Dopa.

339
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,880
That's right.
It's a medicine to wake up your instincts.

340
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,000
Instincts? That's right.

341
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440


342
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,960
After all, you're an animal.

343
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,560
I can't believe you're doing this.

344
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,420
I don't have a PTA, so I don't
know much about Aoi's husband.

345
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,340
Besides, we are animals, aren't we?

346
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,300
If we have a chance, we
will give a treat anywhere.

347
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,320
A treat?

348
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,140
Yes.

349
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,720
A treat.

350
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,410
It's the best.

351
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,890
It's so sticky.

352
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,530
But we need to add some medicine.

353
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,490
Medicine?

354
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,250
Yes.

355
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,630
I think so.

356
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,970
I think it's getting worse.

357
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,670
Right?

358
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,810
It'll be great if we add it.

359
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:10,971
I'm going to give you a kiss.

360
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,170
Wow.

361
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,630
Yes.

362
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,330
Oh, but it feels good.

363
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,950
Yes.

364
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,270
The instinct you have now
will turn around smoothly.

365
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,950
What? Turn around smoothly?

366
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:29,790
Yes.

367
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,370
Turn around smoothly?

368
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,610
Yes.

369
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,210
Turn around smoothly.

370
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:37,990
Drink this and you'll feel better.

371
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,150
I'll feel better...

372
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,710
In 30 seconds, right?

373
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,190
Yes.

374
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,550
If you drink this for 30 seconds,

375
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,710
you'll feel great.

376
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,470
I was scared.

377
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,510
Do you want to put it in?

378
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,410
I can't stand it.

379
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,950
It's a little dark.

380
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,730
No, no, not yet.

381
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,170
Ten seconds left.

382
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,930
No, I can't.

383
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,601
Then try putting it in yourself.

384
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
No, I can't.

385
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,990
Five seconds left.

386
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,070
I can't.

387
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,010
I can't put it in.

388
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,650
It's been 30 minutes.

389
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,850
Wait a minute.

390
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,950
I didn't put it in.

391
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,930
Why?

392
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
I didn't put it in.

393
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
It's hot.

394
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,620
I'll put it in.

395
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,460
I'm sorry.

396
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,560
AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

397
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,480
UGHHHHHHH!!!!

398
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,040
UGHHHHHHH!!!!

399
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,440
%$!&$$!!

400
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,720
censored

401
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,870
I'm covered in bruises!

402
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
You can't even tell

403
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:07,100
if I'm alive or dead Ahhhhhh
UGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

404
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:09,240
Then I'll do this
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

405
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,360
Gahhhh UGHHHH!!!!

406
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:13,361
UGHHHH!!!!!

407
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,700
UGHHHHHHH!!!

408
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:15,701
I still have a lot
to do Oh, my God.

409
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:29,020


410
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:42,080
I can't move at all.

411
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
I'm drooling.

412
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
It's strange.

413
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,820
You remember it on your own.

414
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,140
I want to move by myself.

415
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,180
No! Don't touch
me! Then I'll stop.

416
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160


417
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,060
I want you to touch me.

418
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,180
I want you to touch me a lot.

419
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,480
A lot? I want to go.

420
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,481


421
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,070
I pulled it too much and it came off.

422
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,991
Put it in without using your hands.

423
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,810
I can't use my hands.

424
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,690
Come on, put it in with just one.

425
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:17,670
aaahhh I have to run!

426
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,250
ueahhhh aahhh

427
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:34,571
aaahhh ooohhh aahhh eeehh

428
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,810
ahh aahhh

429
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,130
eeehh

430
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,311
aahhh aahhh

431
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,830
oooh

432
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,790
What's wrong? I'm cold.

433
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,490
Then I'll stop.

434
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,050


435
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,530
I don't want to move.

436
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:03,531
I don't want to move.

437
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,870
You move by yourself.

438
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,670
It's cold.

439
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:13,310
It's cold again.

440
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,330
It's amazing.

441
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,390
It's very tight.

442
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,391
You are amazing.

443
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,290
Ouch! I can't do it.

444
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,550
Let me do it.

445
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,350
I can't do it.

446
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,210
Oh, my God.

447
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,710
Oh, my God.

448
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,410
Oh, my God.

449
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,030
Oh, my God.

450
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,210
I want more.

451
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:51,830
One more time.

452
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,390
Raise your leg.

453
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,590
I feel good.

454
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,790
I feel good.

455
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,740
I'm sorry.

456
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,820


457
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,820
Ouch! Ouch! It hurts.

458
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460


459
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440


460
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,400
I'll move your neck.

461
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,260
I'll move your neck.

462
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,620
I'll move your neck.

463
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,220
I'll move your neck.

464
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:38,140
Show me your beautiful boobies.

465
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200
I'm going to poke you deeply.

466
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,800
Don't be angry.

467
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,260
Don't go.

468
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:19,853
〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔 〔

00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:42,980
I'm sorry.

471
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:53,840
I can't move my hips.

472
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:54,841
I don't know what to do.

473
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,820
I'm so sorry.

474
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I'm so sorry.

475
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,960
It feels so good.

476
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,230
Are you okay?

477
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,190
Well, I am fine, thank you...

478
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,030
Ahh!

479
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,410
Ahh!

480
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,210
Watermelon?

481
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,330
No.

482
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,830
After pill.

483
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,841
You'll be excited again when you transform.

484
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:27,380
The scenery that I have never
seen, the daily life that is fading away.

485
00:46:35,590 --> 00:47:00,980
Until yesterday, my husband
didn't have any complaints.

486
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,260
He accepted my forced
sex once every few months.

487
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:06,261
I accepted it.

488
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:18,910
But now that I know
that pleasure, I can't

489
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:22,600
imagine getting along
with this person anymore.

490
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,080
I want to be loved.

491
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,160
What's wrong?

492
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,200
I wonder if I can't stop my next plan.

493
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,020
You'll be addicted.

494
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,680
Next, I want to be with another daddy.

495
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
It's Dekachin.

496
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,400
I can't stop thinking about it.

497
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,749
Then, let's play
rock-paper-scissors and decide

498
00:47:56,761 --> 00:47:58,501
what to give to Dekachin
and Aoi as a pair.

499
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,280
Oh, I see.

500
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,220
After all, it's great sex.

501
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:12,560
When I'm tired, I feel
like I'm going to faint.

502
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,360
I'm getting goosebumps.

503
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,370
It's an hour earlier than the navigation.

504
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,070
That's amazing.

505
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:28,990
Didn't you get
drunk? I was fine.

506
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,210


507
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:32,970
I was drinking a lot.

508
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,830
That's different.

509
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,470
Do you have it? It's too much.

510
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,750
It's called Maserati.

511
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
It's stylish.

512
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,870
It's a Nagoyaki cat.

513
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Everyone is riding it.

514
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,060
It's a Ferrari.

515
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,250
It's a little old.

516
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,190
I can't ride it.

517
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,090
It's too fast.

518
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,850
But you couldn't say it was
fast, could you? It was amazing.

519
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,305


520
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,430
I don't think so.

521
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,350
I don't think so.

522
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:08,986
If you work a little harder, you'll
be able to do it in 30 seconds.

523
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,490
It's been a while since I've done it.

524
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,000
What should we do with
the first combination?

525
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,280
Let's do it as usual.

526
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,880
Let's do it with four people.

527
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,000
One, two, three.

528
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,240
Good bye.

529
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
I forgot.

530
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,720
Oh, I forgot.

531
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,380
I'm glad.

532
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,040
I'm glad.

533
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,760
It's not good if it's like this.

534
00:49:45,245 --> 00:49:49,960
I prepared a new one today,
so you can see a different world.

535
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,040
I'm looking forward to it.

536
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
Let's go.

537
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:55,540
Let's go.

538
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:56,541
What is it? Here you are.

539
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,990


540
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,760
Call me if you need anything.

541
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,220
OK.

542
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,410
New brand.

543
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,350
What?

544
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,390
What will it be?

545
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,550
Do you want to try?

546
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,220
SOSORITATSU

547
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,410
SOSORITATSU?

548
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:44,930
SOSORITATSU

549
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,860
SOSORITATSU

550
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,381
SOSORITATSU Right?

551
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,510
It's my first time.

552
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,630
Let's get into the stimulation.

553
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,500
Follow me.

554
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:39,700
I feel something strange.

555
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,500
I'm getting a little nervous.

556
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,820
Right?

557
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
What's wrong? It's so fast.

558
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,030


559
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,940
It's getting warmer.

560
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,770
It's getting hotter.

561
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:01,136
It's getting hotter and hotter.

562
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:12,170
Wow, what is this?

563
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:25,646
My tongue is getting hotter and hotter.

564
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,370
I'm getting very sensitive.

565
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,050
It's so hot.

566
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,870
I just touched it.

567
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,850
What is this?

568
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:08,340
I'm starting to feel sick.

569
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,340
My boobs are sticking out.

570
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:32,050
I haven't been touched yet.

571
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,350
What's this?

572
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,280
I want you to touch me.

573
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,310
Why are you touching
me? I don't know.

574
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,650
This is the first time.

575
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,090
You are so cute.

576
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,650
What should I do? I don't know.

577
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120


578
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:40,410
I can feel it very much.

579
00:55:05,155 --> 00:55:06,360
Hey, look.

580
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
Oh, no.

581
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Look at me.

582
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:24,900
I'm just playing with you.

583
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,640
Can I go? I can't.

584
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,310


585
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,530
You can't? I can't.

586
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,461
You can't? I can't.

587
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780


588
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,480
You can't?

589
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:29,620
I can't, I can't.

590
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:29,640
I can't.

591
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:36,060
If you make me cry
like that, I'm going to cry.

592
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:39,220
Mom, I'm sorry.

593
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:48,430
Show me more erotic figure.

594
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,170
Mom, please help me.

595
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,450
I know.

596
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,970
I'm sorry.

597
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,010
I'm sorry.

598
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:06,530
Don't cry.

599
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,920
I can't believe it.

600
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
I can't believe it.

601
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,760
I can't believe it.

602
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:41,580
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

603
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,720
I can't speak any more.

604
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,760
Please help me.

605
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,100
I feel like I'm going to puke.

606
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,580
【【Shout】】 【【Shout】】

607
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,661
【【Shout】】 Oh, oh!

608
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:36,660
Oh, no, no, no, no!

609
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,380
Ouch!

610
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,470
Oh, it's so cold!

611
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,130
Oh, no!

612
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,390
The water's dripping.

613
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,560
Oh my God!

614
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,730
No.

615
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,420
What's wrong? Oh, no.

616
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000


617
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,150
Not yet, not yet.

618
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:35,800
Wait a minute.

619
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,460
No, no, no.

620
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:38,461
I haven't hit you yet.

621
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,960
I haven't hit you yet.

622
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:40,961
What's going on?

623
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,700
What's going on?

624
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,560
What's going on? Koko.

625
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,840
..

626
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:53,360
Koko...

627
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,020
What's going on?

628
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:56,021
Oh, no!

629
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,560
Oh, it's cold! Oh, it's cold.

630
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,620
It's cold, isn't it? I'm sorry.

631
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:04,621
I'm sorry.

632
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:39,880


633
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,040
I didn't mean to.

634
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,340
I'm sorry.

635
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,350
I'm sorry.

636
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:14,130
I'm sorry.

637
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,610
I'm sorry.

638
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,710
I'm so wet.

639
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,470
You got dirty.

640
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,900
My underwear got dirty.

641
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,560
I know.

642
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,830
I'm so wet.

643
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,790
I want you to do more.

644
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,010
I won't be found out.

645
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:44,390
Are you okay? I'm okay.

646
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,071
Are you okay? I'm okay.

647
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,050


648
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,020
I want to go home.

649
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,541
Then, you should be more careful.

650
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,660
I'm so nervous.

651
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:41,180
No, no, no.

652
01:03:41,181 --> 01:03:42,181
One more time.

653
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:59,400
I can't do it.

654
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,060
I can't do it.

655
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,420
I can't do it.

656
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:36,710
I can't do it.

657
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:54,950
It's okay.

658
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,310
I'll get it dirty.

659
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,570
It's okay.

660
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,070
Oh, it's cold.

661
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,610
It's getting warmer.

662
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,730
Look at me.

663
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:07,450
What do you want?

664
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,710
I want a pair of scarves.

665
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,350
I want a pair of scarves.

666
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:16,890
Scarves.

667
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,950
I want a scarf to put my skin on.

668
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,830
I want an ointment.

669
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,090
Don't worry.

670
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:44,590
Whoops, I wanted to say thank
you, but my Korean is not perfect...

671
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:50,710
Don't cry, it's gonna be just for today.

672
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,150
Thank you.

673
01:06:54,250 --> 01:07:07,450
Oh, it's so hot.

674
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:14,690
Oh, it's so hot.

675
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,130
It's so hot.

676
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:43,470
It's very hard.

677
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,070
I like to spit it out.

678
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,350
It's delicious.

679
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,110
Is it delicious? It's delicious.

680
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,410
It's delicious.

681
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,810


682
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:46,520
It's amazing, isn't it?

683
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:52,420
It's amazing, isn't it?

684
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,270
Are you excited?

685
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,871
Are you even more excited?

686
01:08:57,045 --> 01:08:58,280
Look, you're bleeding.

687
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,060
Oh, I see.

688
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,090
We are going to get our hair cut.

689
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:36,850
What's happening?

690
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:37,950
Where are we going?

691
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,020
Where are we going?

692
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,640
Good!

693
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,900
Wow!

694
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:20,790
Awesome! A little more.

695
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,090


696
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:48,070
How do you feel? It hurts.

697
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:54,680
It hurts.

698
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,540


699
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,060
How does it work? I don't know.

700
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680


701
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,460
If it gets bigger than
this, it will explode.

702
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

703
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,920
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

704
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000


705
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,960
Does it feel good?

706
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,280
You're so small.

707
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,680
I'm not ready yet.

708
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:57,580
My husband and I bought a new cat
tower for the first time in a long time.

709
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,640
It is a cat tower that can
be used for a long time.

710
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,960
Pocky is very hard.

711
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,940
Pocky is very hard.

712
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,120
Pocky is very hard.

713
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,320
Pocky is very hard.

714
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:29,060
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's so cute.

715
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:35,200
I'm so happy.

716
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,060
I'm so happy.

717
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,110
I'm so happy.

718
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,630
I'm so happy.

719
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:00,030
I'm so happy.

720
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:00,230
I'm so happy.

721
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:00,270
I'm so happy.

722
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:01,271
I'm so happy.

723
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:02,930
Look at me from above.

724
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,350
With you?

725
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:19,710
Your breasts are the best.

726
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:38,450
Do you love me? Oh, no.

727
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:12,230
Oh, no.

728
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,351
Oh, my tongue is dirty.

729
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:25,270
Oh, my tongue is getting bigger.

730
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,190
Oh, my tongue is getting worse.

731
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,450
Thank you.

732
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:40,610
Thank you.

733
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,210
Oh, my head.

734
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,250
Oh, it feels good.

735
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,350
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

736
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,350


737
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,290
Wow.

738
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,850
Oh, it feels good.

739
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:52,820
Open your mouth.

740
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,200
Oh, it feels good.

741
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,930
〈The sound of a baby crying.

742
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,870
〉 I'm sweating a lot.

743
01:16:38,305 --> 01:16:56,740
〈The sound of a baby crying.

744
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,750
〉 He is very excited.

745
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,890
He is very excited.

746
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,010
He is sticking out his tongue.

747
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,150
Wow, you have a big belly.

748
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:44,250
Yes, you do.

749
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:50,070
Let me go.

750
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:57,010
Give me a lot.

751
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,550
Do you like shark? Yes, I do.

752
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,630
Give me a lot.

753
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,971
Please give me a lot of jam.

754
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,170
Give me a lot of jam.

755
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:22,290
Give me a lot of jam.

756
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:26,450
You got a lot of jam!

757
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,120
You got a lot of jam!

758
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,380
Wow! It feels good.

759
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,900
It's good.

760
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,440
It's delicious.

761
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:51,441


762
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,540
I'm going to sleep.

763
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:18,530
I'm a little sleepy.

764
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,850
Is this good for whitening?

765
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,410
It might get bigger.

766
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:31,190
I want more if it gets bigger.

767
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,510
You want more? I want more.

768
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,750


769
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:40,130
She's not answering.

770
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,410
Where the hell is she at this hour?

771
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:49,186
If she doesn't answer, it'll be a problem.

772
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,250
I can't help it.

773
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:03,860
I didn't even do the laundry.

774
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:27,230
Let's try something else this time.

775
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,060
What is it?

776
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:34,600
It may sound a little different.

777
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:41,590
It's so green.

778
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,180
Let go of your tongue.

779
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:28,660
I'm going to ask you in 30 seconds.

780
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,420
I'm getting hot.

781
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:57,520
It's amazing, isn't it?

782
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,490
It's getting hot.

783
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:17,790
It's getting hot.

784
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:23,270
There, too.

785
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:24,570
Here, too.

786
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,630
There, too.

787
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,170
You want to touch it, don't you?

788
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,351
You want to touch
it, but you can't help it.

789
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,281
If you want, you can touch it yourself.

790
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:54,650
You can go to heaven.

791
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,390
Heaven?

792
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:57,830
Yes.

793
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,850
Come on, show me.

794
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:04,851
I can't touch you.

795
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,520
I just touched the air.

796
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,640
You're trembling.

797
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:31,220
Look, you're trembling so much.

798
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:35,000
I didn't touch you, but
you're trembling so much.

799
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,720
No, you can't touch me.

800
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,040
I can't touch you?

801
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,400
No.

802
01:23:43,401 --> 01:23:44,401
What?

803
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:48,200
You want to touch
it, but you can't help it.

804
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:55,895
I can't stand it.

805
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,230
Let me see.

806
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,060
Do you like it? Yes, I do.

807
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,660
I love it.

808
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:25,700
Let me see.

809
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,620


810
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:33,530
Let me touch it.

811
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,180
I can't help but feel that my body is cold.

812
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,460
Where do you feel cold? Here.

813
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:51,810


814
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,990
I can't stand it.

815
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,545
My nose is running.

816
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,520
Ouch!

817
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,400
Ouch!

818
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:58,810
Ouch!

819
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:15,940
What have I been doing all this time?

820
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,800
I want a lot more.

821
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,440
Oh, my God! It's so hot.

822
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:31,180
It's so hot.

823
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:32,880
It's so hot.

824
01:28:58,050 --> 01:29:09,010
It's so hot.

825
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:13,550
Can I take off my pants?

826
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:15,990
No.

827
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:17,390
No?

828
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:49,410
This is a video taken on
the day of the earthquake.

829
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,511
The video was taken
on the day of the quake.

830
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:11,410
It smells good.

831
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,090
I think it's enough for you.

832
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:17,350
No, it's not.

833
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,080
It stinks.

834
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:01,170
This one is big, too.

835
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:10,810
What do you want to do?

836
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:14,250
I want to lick you.

837
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:16,370
Are you going to lick me? Okay.

838
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:22,260


839
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,760
Your back is so soft.

840
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:41,280
It's hot.

841
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:47,300
It's hot, isn't
it? It's delicious.

842
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:58,220


843
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,260
You are so happy.

844
01:32:43,261 --> 01:32:44,376
You love me so much, don't you?

845
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,820
I won't run away from you.

846
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:58,090
You are so happy.

847
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,470
I love you so much.

848
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,730
You are so hard.

849
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,140
It's hot.

850
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:50,680
I was able to sleep well tonight.

851
01:34:50,705 --> 01:34:55,240
I'm glad I slept well.

852
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:56,241
I'm glad I slept well.

853
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:26,600
I'm going to make a video of
the process of making this video.

854
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,600
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

855
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,420
Good morning.

856
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:10,110
It's all done.

857
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:13,930
There you go.

858
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:18,530


859
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:29,170
Let me see your tongue.

860
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:42,390
It's delicious.

861
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:44,390
Hoshi

862
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:28,790
Hoshi Give it to me.

863
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,240


864
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:42,790
Oh, it feels good.

865
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:47,030
Can I put your tongue out?

866
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,620
Are you ready?

867
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,160
Are you ready?

868
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:46,870
I want you to make me feel better.

869
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,660
Welcome back.

870
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,760
Did you drink?

871
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:58,580
Yes.

872
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:00,260
There was a gathering of friends.

873
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:02,500
You haven't moved recently.

874
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:06,100
Miu was worried about your mother.

875
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:09,900
Miu? She's asleep.

876
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:11,860


877
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,900
What do you mean?

878
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,160
Are you giving up your child?

879
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:29,520
Even if I get married and have
a child, you didn't help me at all.

880
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,780
Can't I just grow my wings?

881
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,940
No, I just said it's okay once in a while.

882
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:41,940
Once in a while?

883
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:45,400
You're always looking around.

884
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,433
As Miki said, it's
true that if you rebel

885
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:55,220
against your strength,
you won't be cheated.

886
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:44,150
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying.

887
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:45,590
I'm not sure if it's a baby
crying or a baby's crying.

888
01:40:45,591 --> 01:40:48,270
I'm not sure if it's a baby
crying or a baby's crying.

889
01:40:48,271 --> 01:40:50,270
I'm not sure if it's a baby
crying or a baby's crying.

890
01:40:50,271 --> 01:40:52,630
I'm not sure if it's a baby
crying or a baby's crying.

891
01:41:52,630 --> 01:42:25,520

Are you okay?

896
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:09,170
Are you okay?

897
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:12,550
Are you okay?

898
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:13,930
Are you okay?

899
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,590
Are you okay?

900
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,050
Are you okay?

901
01:43:17,051 --> 01:43:17,830
Are you okay?

902
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:20,490
Are you okay?

903
01:43:20,491 --> 01:43:21,491
What?

904
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:26,000
Can't you come today? I'm sorry.

905
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:28,140


906
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,600
My husband is very suspicious.

907
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:32,480
No.

908
01:43:32,481 --> 01:43:34,041
I don't know what you're talking about.

909
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,440
What?

910
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,320
What's that?

911
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:38,940
What kind of man?

912
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:43,060
App Matching?

913
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,160
Yeah, today too.

914
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:48,420
Are you young?

915
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,000
I'm a college student.

916
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,880
Aren't you hot? I know.

917
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,300


918
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
But

919
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:00,500
You're always bored with
your dad, aren't you? Hi, I'm Aji.

920
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:01,501


921
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,680
What's it like to be a college student?

922
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:13,120
Unlike you, I know I'm getting serious.

923
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,100
Scary.

924
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,160
30 seconds.

925
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:05,870
It's getting hot.

926
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,520
20 seconds.

927
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:17,160
Wow, I'm getting hungry.

928
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:19,980
10 seconds.

929
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,640
Are you okay?

930
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:33,300
Yes.

931
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:36,700
Do you want to drink some herbal medicine?

932
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:39,900
I don't want to.

933
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,340
I don't want to mix it.

934
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,040
Then, I'll take this.

935
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:45,041
What should I do? It's okay.

936
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:18,640
I'm so sad.

937
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,210


938
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:36,850
What are you sad about?

939
01:46:54,505 --> 01:46:55,350
This is a video of me
practicing my English.

940
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:56,190
I'm nervous about this video.

941
01:46:56,191 --> 01:46:57,490
I'm nervous about my English.

942
01:46:58,615 --> 01:46:59,970
I'm nervous about my English.

943
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:06,050
I'm nervous about my English.

944
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:07,750
It's so dirty.

945
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:12,870
I can see that you're enjoying it.

946
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:25,960
It feels so good.

947
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:45,120
It feels so good.

948
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:56,540
I'm sorry.

949
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:09,240
I'm sorry.

950
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,160
I'm sorry.

951
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:16,120
Are you okay?

952
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:36,440
Today, I have something more fun.

953
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,580
What is it?

954
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Do you want to fly?

955
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,060
What is it?

956
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:46,660
You'll be a baby.

957
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:49,200
What? A baby?

958
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:50,320
It'll be a big deal.

959
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:06,660
What's that? What's going to happen?

960
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:08,760
What's going to happen?

961
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:11,920
You can look forward to it.

962
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,870
Oh, my God!

963
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:40,530
Oh, my God! I feel so good.

964
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:44,350
I feel so good.

965
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,780
I feel so good.

966
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,320
I feel so good.

967
01:50:06,945 --> 01:50:09,540


968
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,130
ーWhat's wrong?

969
01:50:54,570 --> 01:51:06,890
ーYour sticker is...

970
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:09,590
ーI can't die.

971
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:16,710
ーI'm gonna die.

972
01:51:23,115 --> 01:51:26,050
It smells so good.

973
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:40,880
It smells so good.

974
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,360
I'm going to sleep.

975
01:52:16,115 --> 01:52:18,040
I'm going to sleep.

976
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:49,980
Don't play with me.

977
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,200
Ah!

978
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:21,160
Sis! What happened to you? Sis!

979
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:53,420
How is it?

980
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,020
Is it okay?

981
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,680
Are you okay?

982
01:53:58,330 --> 01:53:59,660
Don't move your hip.

983
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:05,280
I'm going to clean your hip.

984
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:13,190
I'm going to clean your hip.

985
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:04,480
I can't do it anymore.

986
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,120
Don't cry.

987
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,480
Don't cry.

988
01:55:24,175 --> 01:55:30,350
I'm sorry.

989
01:55:49,080 --> 01:56:10,040
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a thing.

990
01:56:10,041 --> 01:56:10,140
I've never seen such a thing.

991
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:12,420
I've never seen such a thing.

992
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,960
ーHow do you feel? ーI'm fine.

993
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:19,420
ーDo you want to have a break? ーNo.

994
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:21,020
ーYou are strong.

995
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:27,380
ーYou can't get up.

996
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,520
Are you satisfied only with your mouth?

997
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:58,551
I can't be satisfied only with my mouth.

998
01:56:58,970 --> 01:56:59,970
Let me see.

999
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:04,300
I put it in.

1000
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:07,820
Show me your butt.

1001
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,680
Show me your butt.

1002
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:14,880
Show me your butt.

1003
01:57:57,770 --> 01:58:00,740
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

1004
01:58:00,741 --> 01:58:02,341
※This is the sound of a baby swallowing.

1005
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,600
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

1006

01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:57,510
I'm going to do it.

1009
01:58:57,511 --> 01:58:58,511
I'm going to do it.

1010
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:16,900
Do you want more? I want more.

1011
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:19,520
Look at this.

1012
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:21,280


1013
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:26,160
I put the cat food in the bowl.

1014
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:42,160
I put the cat food in the bowl.

1015
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,260
I'm going to sleep.

1016
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:48,900
I feel good.

1017
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,710
I'm going to sleep.

1018
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:06,390
I feel good.

1019
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:10,910
I'm going to sleep.

1020
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:23,820
〔Crying〕

1021
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:36,060
〔Crying〕

1022
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:38,660
〔Crying〕

1023
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,440
〔Crying〕

1031
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,720
Oh my god!

1032
02:01:34,721 --> 02:01:35,721
What should I do?

1033
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:59,520

Oh, it's hard.

1036
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:23,690
Let's do it again.

1037
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:20,890
I'm so tired.

1038
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:48,760
I'm so tired.

1039
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:50,680
I'm so tired.

1040
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:58,310
I feel so good.

1041
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:52,530
I want to go to the bathroom, but
my stomach hurts more and more.

1042
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,200
I'm going to sleep.

1043
02:05:23,201 --> 02:05:24,201
I feel so good.

1044
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:31,900
How do you feel? I feel so good.

1045
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,040
Good.

1046
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:38,940


1047
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:44,340
I'm going to sleep.

1048
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,120
Good night.

1049
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,740
I'm going to sleep.

1050
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:54,020
This is the first time I've ever seen
a baby crying in front of a camera.

1051
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:59,500
I was surprised to see a baby
crying in front of a camera.

1052
02:06:59,501 --> 02:07:01,496
I was surprised to see a baby
crying in front of a camera.

1053
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:04,800
Hurry up.

1054
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:32,200
My stomach hurts.

1055
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:05,330
Do you like me? I like you.

1056
02:08:06,005 --> 02:08:07,730


1057
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:47,650
Oh, it's so hot.

1058
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,750
Oh, it's so hot.

1059
02:08:50,751 --> 02:08:57,290
Mom, I'm going to sleep.

1060
02:08:59,270 --> 02:09:00,770
You have a very gentle face.

1061
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:07,650
You look like a real animal.

1062
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:10,950
I'm going to sleep.

1063
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:17,450
I'm going to sleep.

1064
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:20,250
I'm going to sleep.

1065
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:21,570
Not yet.

1066
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:22,790
Not yet?

1067
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:25,850
May I go to bed?

1068
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:27,270
I'm going to sleep.

1069
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:38,500
I feel good.

1070
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:53,770
It's broken.

1071
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:54,930
Oh my, oh my!

1072
02:10:55,610 --> 02:10:55,830
Oh my, oh my!

1073
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:57,110
Oh my, oh my!

1074
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,940
消えた。 涙出た。

1075
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:26,240
嗚呼、水。

1076
02:11:30,030 --> 02:11:31,320
涙痛い。 痛い。 It's a lie.

1077
02:11:33,810 --> 02:11:35,360
It's a lie.

1078
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,220
It's a lie.

1079
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:45,860
I'm sorry.

1080
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:47,640


1081
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,710
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

1082
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:18,830


1083
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:22,510
I don't know what I said.

1084
02:13:22,511 --> 02:13:23,511
Oh my god.

1085
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:27,640
I'm going to take a bath.

1086
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:26,220
〔Yuko's mother is crying.

1087
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,160
〕 You're dead.

1088
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:44,040
It's not over yet.

1089
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:03,520
〔Yuko's mother is crying.

1090
02:16:03,521 --> 02:16:04,521
〕 Are you satisfied?

1091
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,300
I want to help you.

1092
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:11,940
〔Yuko's mother is crying.

1093
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:13,340
〕 What are you going to do?

1094
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:32,170
What are you going to do?

1095
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:47,450
Which one?

1096
02:17:17,430 --> 02:17:18,550
I can't hear anything.

1097
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:32,180
I can't hear anything.

1098
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:24,090
私の声はあまりにも小さくなく、 しみじみにしています。

1099
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:28,831
私の声がより小さくなるまで気をつけましょう。
私は非常に熱いです。 私は本当に怪我をしていた。

1100
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:37,830
K.Y.M.Nは私にとってのとても悲しいことです。
私は原因としてそれをやめられない。

1101
02:19:42,390 --> 02:19:56,250
I finally got the monthly salary for the
month and a half of raising my daughter.

1102
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:04,928
I was wondering how she
would react when she heard

1103
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:06,960
that her daughter not
received the monthly salary.

1104
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:10,580
But she loved the word she had received.

1105
02:20:11,130 --> 02:20:12,480
Oh, my God!

1106
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:21,440
Are you all right?

1107
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:16,440
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

1108
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:17,120
I'm so happy.

1109
02:21:17,121 --> 02:21:18,121
I'm so happy.

1110
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:22,340
I'm so happy.

1111
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:23,900
I'm so happy.

1112
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:26,260
I'm so happy.

1113
02:21:26,261 --> 02:21:27,261
Ah!

1114
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:28,900
Ah! Welcome back.

1115
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:35,810


1116
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,160
You look a bit pale.

1117
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:48,860
I had a bad smell of tobacco in the
bar, so I'm going to take a shower.

1118
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:52,340
I'll go to bed first.

1119
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,760
Good night.

1120
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,060
Good night.

1121
02:22:55,061 --> 02:23:20,540
I'm going to watch it on
LINE while waiting for it.

1122
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:21,820
I'm so busy.

1123
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:28,440
What is this video?
