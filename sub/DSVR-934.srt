1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,740
I heard that today's guests are a
couple and three female friends.

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,900
I wonder what will happen.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,381
There are not many places
where three people can massage.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,820
That's right.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,820
I just opened it, but I hope it goes well.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,540
You guys enjoy it, too.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,420
Come on, put more beauty in it.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,360
Do you want more?

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
More?

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,020
You can put more, can't you?

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:53,510
If you put more, it
will be more fun, right?

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,300
I made a reservation.

13
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,140
Yes.

14
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,500
Would you like to have a meal?

15
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,520
Yes, I'm listening. Please wait a moment.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,460
Here she comes.

17
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,460
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,520
This place looks very expensive.

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,550
Is it okay?

20
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,120
But this is the place which
Ruka introduced to me.

21
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,880
It's totally fine.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Really?

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,312
I looked at the website,
and it seems like

24
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,300
the three of us will be
able to take the test.

25
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,820
It seems like we have to renew it.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,300
I see.

27
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,301
It's new.

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I see.

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,140
So, only the new ones
are beautiful? I think so.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640


31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,920
Wow, but it's a high-class place.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
I'm so excited.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,860
It's been a long time since
we took the test, right?

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
How was it? No, no, no.

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,860
No, no, no.

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,020


37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,100
You should sleep after you get home.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
That's right.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,560
Did we go on a trip the
other day? Yes, we did.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,260
It was in Korea,
wasn't it? Yes, it was.

41
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,140


42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,420
It was fun, wasn't
it? Yes, it was.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,020


44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
I want to go again.

45
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,180
The essay at that time was good, too.

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
Yes, it felt good.

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
Yes, it was fun.

48
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm getting more and more excited.

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,420
Let's go together next time.

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,820
If we go together next
time, what will happen to me?

51
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,280
Let's go together again.

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,460
No, no. Don't you feel lonely?

53
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,751
You know I don't have
a boyfriend, don't you?

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Why don't you make one?

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,380
What's that?

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,160
You're flirting there.

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,180
No, no, no.

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
I envy you.

59
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,380
You should give me this baby.

60
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,000
What's that? What do you mean?

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,580
No?

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,380
It's me, isn't it?

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,420
Really?

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
You're a little lost,
aren't you? I'm thinking.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240


66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,900
You're thinking, aren't
you? Think about it.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Stop it.

68
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880


69
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,400
What are you doing?

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,760
I'll do it when I get home.

71
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,060
That's right.

72
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm a little embarrassed.

73
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,936
It's my second year as a member of society.

74
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,040
Even though it's in front of God, stop it.

75
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,041
Don't do that.

76
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,780
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

77
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,260
I don't know when customers will come.

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Please don't do that.

79
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,100
Please don't do that.

80
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
Please don't do that.

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,940
Let's get rid of our tiredness
for the second year in a row.

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,700
Excuse me.

83
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:15,200
Thank you for coming.

84
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:21,160
Thank you for coming today.

85
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,540
We will serve you.

86
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,720
This is a welcome drink herb tea.

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,100
Thank you.

88
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,580
Please drink a lot.

89
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Thank you.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Let's drink.

91
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,460
Please.

92
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Thank you.

93
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,720
It smells good.

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,520
It's good.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Is it good?

96
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,900
Is this lemon? Yes, it is.

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,601
It also contains lemon grass.

98
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
It is very effective for the neck.

99
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Is that so?

100
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,820
We also blend lavender, which
is good for sleep, in our own way.

101
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,900
That's great.

102
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,820
Please drink a lot.

103
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,740
Thank you.

104
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
Please.

105
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Nice to meet you.

106
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,900
Are you her boyfriend?

107
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Which one? Yes, I am.

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,060


109
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,640
He is my ex-boyfriend.

110
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
What? Really?

111
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Are you kidding me? No, I'm not.

112
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
I believe you.

113
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,501
Are you kidding me? Stop it.

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,900


115
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
You three get along well.

116
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,400
We've been friends since we were students.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,240
I see.

118
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,320
I think today's course is perfect for you.

119
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,260
Actually, we are going to have a
fun massage with friends today.

120
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,500
But you may be confused
because you have just started.

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,860
So, we are going to have a
half-price massage. How do you like it?

122
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,940
I saw it on a page.

123
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Please do it.

124
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Thank you.

125
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:12,681
I'm glad you like it.

126
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,140
I'm looking forward to it.

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,860
There are two types of course,
dry course and course using oil.

128
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,100
Is it okay for you
to use oil? It's okay.

129
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,005


130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,240
I think it's better for you.

131
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,180
I can get rid of tiredness.

132
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,100
Please tell me where you are tired.

133
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,720
Can you tell me what you are good at?

134
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,540
I am good at shoulder work.

135
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,000
I am good at shoulder work.

136
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,660
I am good at shoulder work.

137
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:47,760
I am good at shoulder work.

138
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:47,840
I am good at shoulder work.

139
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,360
I am good at shoulder work.

140
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,340
I am good at shoulder work.

141
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,320
I am good at shoulder work.

142
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,740
I am good at shoulder work.

143
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,640
I am good at shoulder work.

144
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,780
I am good at shoulder work.

145
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:05,781
Is it around here?

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,140
There are quite a lot of shoulders.

147
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,040
Then, let's focus on the shoulders.

148
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,320
Here are the shoulders.

149
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,920
Thank you, everyone.

150
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:33,812
Also, in this exhibition, the male audience
will be massaged by the female audience,

151
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:38,260
and the female audience will be massaged
by the male audience. Is that okay?

152
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Is that so?

153
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,180
Is there a reason for that?

154
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,995
In fact, the female audience
tends to prefer a stronger

155
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,140
massage, and the male
audience tends to feel pain.

156
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,620
I see.

157
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,381
It may be because they
like strong massages.

158
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,160
I see.

159
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,180
Interesting.

160
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,800
Are you okay?

161
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,580
Please drink more tea.

162
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
You can relax.

164
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:12,660
Please drink a lot.

165
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,640
Thank you.

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
It will warm your body.

167
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,280
Please drink more.

168
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,281
Please sit down.

169
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,510
I drank it all.

170
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,110
It was delicious.

171
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,030
It was good.

172
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,410
Thank you for the meal.

173
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,670
Thank you for the meal.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,170
The room will be ready
soon, so please wait.

175
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,750
Yes.

176
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,510
Have you changed
your clothes? It's early.

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,530


178
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,670
I'm changing my clothes now.

179
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,430
Aren't the pants too small?

180
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,030
I wonder if it's okay.

181
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,510
Hey, are the men's pants too small?

182
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,460
I wonder if it's really okay.

183
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,720
I've changed my clothes,
so let's take a look.

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,800
Oh, really? Can you take a look?

185
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
The one next to it?

186
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Yes.

187
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,010
It's small, isn't it?

188
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,770
It looks small to me, too.

189
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:49,771
What do you mean? Like this.

190
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,070
Oh, I see.

191
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,470


192
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,730
It's easier for people
who use oil to apply.

193
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,830
I see. That's why it's smaller.

194
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,450
It's a little embarrassing.

195
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:05,590
It's embarrassing.

196
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,130
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

197
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,660
You were watching it, weren't you?

198
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
I don't mind watching it.

199
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,940
By the way, you are quite muscular.

200
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,530
You have a nice body.

201
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm a woman.

202
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,120
How do I look?

203
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,740
I don't look like Rika.

204
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,640
Hey, Sana.

205
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,290
Are you doing
something? No, I'm not.

206
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,021
I'm just chatting.

207
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,320
Chatting?

208
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Yes.

209
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,840
What do you mean
by chatting? Well.

210
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,080
..

211
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,100
If you tease me, I'll
stop being your friend.

212
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,660
You don't have to do that.

213
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm nervous.

214
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,640
But I'm looking forward to it.

215
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,660
After this, let's go to
have a meal together.

216
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,190
Thank you.

217
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,330
Thank you.

218
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,730
Let's get started.

219
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,330
I'll start from your shoulders.

220
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,330
You have a lot of hair.

221
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,130
I don't think there are many
people who have this much hair.

222
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,350
Do you have a lot of work to do?

223
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,810
Oh, you work on the outside.

224
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,470
I see. Then you can use your body a lot.

225
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,270
It's a little far away, so may
I excuse you? Excuse me.

226
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,250
Here we go.

227
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140


228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Are you all right?

229
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,010
This side is easier to operate.

230
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,030
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,430
Are you all right around here?

232
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
You have a lot of hair.

233
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,630
Did you do any sports? I see.

234
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,220


235
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,460
When you were in college?

236
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,850
There are a lot of questions.

237
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,300
What kind of relationship do you have?

238
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,440
A friend in college?

239
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,580
Do you think it's Rika?

240
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:50,741
What do you think,
Kana-chan? Ah, Kana-chan.

241
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,620
That's it.

242
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780


243
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Kana-chan seems to have been
added to make her body warm.

244
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
I'm sure she was looking forward to it.

245
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,160
Did you have a relationship?

246
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Did you have a friend?

247
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,940
I didn't know that.

248
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
Your boyfriend seems to be very popular.

249
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,620
He is definitely popular, isn't he?

250
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,420
If I say such a thing,
Rika-san will scold me.

251
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:42,710
Hey, I'm glad you came. Can you hear me?

252
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,530
Yes, I can hear you.

253
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:56,560
Where are you working? I see.

254
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,880
By the way, you said you came here
with your boyfriend. Do you know who he is?

255
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,280
Yes, I do.

256
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Oh, really?

257
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,240
He is a Samaritan.

258
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,040
Oh, I see.

259
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,420
He is a man who does his best.

260
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,480
I see.

261
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,340
I see.

262
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,980
That's nice.

263
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,700
Can we have a massage together?

264
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,460
I want to see you after a long time.

265
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,780
I wonder if there are many
old people in this crowd.

266
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
What's the matter?

267
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
I'll get some oil.

268
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,400
Excuse me.

269
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,600
I'll use the oil to remove the blood.

270
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,960
It's very hot.

271
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,880
Rika-san, you make a strange sound.

272
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,030
Are you feeling
better? It's hot.

273
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,880


274
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,610
Your friend looks very comfortable.

275
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,370
Can you hear it?

276
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,510
Please raise your hand.

277
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Are you all right?

278
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,460
I'm just massaging your lower back.

279
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,020
Your breath is getting heavier.
What's wrong?

280
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:24,021
Did you hear that?

281
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,860
I think the tip of your
ears are very sensitive.

282
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
You feel good, don't you?

283
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,770
You don't have to look at me so much.

284
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,510
I entrusted you to a person
who is good at massaging.

285
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,770
Are you nervous?

286
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,970
Please do something.

287
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,960
You are using a hot water
bath, so your body will be warm.

288
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,340
Excuse me.

289
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,520
How are you?

290
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm a little hot, too.

291
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,780
Rika-san and her friends
are enjoying the massage.

292
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,090
Are you curious?

293
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,091
Are you okay?

294
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,110
What's wrong? Excuse me.

295
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,110


296
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Are you okay?

297
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,110
It seems that the
massage was a little strong.

298
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,590
Are you okay?

299
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,270
Then I will massage your legs.

300
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,580
How long has it been
since you last saw Rika-san?

301
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,840
Two weeks?

302
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,630
You have a lot of things to
look forward to tonight, don't you?

303
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,610
Rika-san is so small, but
she has a good personality.

304
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,370
She is a very proud girl.

305
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,440
Sit down.

306
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,740
Wow, your legs are full.

307
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,320
You are working hard.

308
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
I want to be firm.

309
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,680
May I be excused? Excuse me.

310
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,190


311
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,710
You don't have to worry
so much about your mother.

312
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,490
More than that, you are
worried about me, aren't you?

313
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,930
I'm drawing on your face.

314
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:14,931
I'm going to massage you.

315
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,680
Are you Rika-san?

316
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:50,960
Rika-san is just getting
a massage, so it's okay.

317
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:58,160
Don't worry too much.
Just focus on my massage.

318
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,010
What's wrong?

319
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,310
Are you surprised?

320
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,710
I can see you from this side,
but not from the other side.

321
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:20,610
I can't see anything, so it's okay.

322
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,790
This is a special massage for you.

323
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,730
You were surprised, weren't you?

324
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,880
How do you feel?

325
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,400
You are massaging your friend.

326
00:23:49,580 --> 00:24:05,300
Did you get scared?

327
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,301
How do you feel?

328
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
You know,

329
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:17,270
when you see such a big boob,

330
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,830
you get nervous,
don't you? Look.

331
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,930


332
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,370
Even though Mika-chan is here,

333
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:39,570
you got nervous because of your friend's
appearance and massage on me, right?

334
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,890
Rika-san's massage is a
hip-up massage for women.

335
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,490
It's okay.

336
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,850
That is also a hip-up massage.

337
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,250
Don't worry.

338
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,830
That is also a massage.

339
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,420
Riko-san, you seem to be in a good mood.

340
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Are you feeling dizzy?

341
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,270
I'll give you a good massage.

342
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,271
Let's do it.

343
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,180
A lot.

344
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,130
She is next to you.

345
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,270
Do you hate her?

346
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,271
Are you okay?

347
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,720
You both drank a lot of tea, so I
guess your blood flow is getting better.

348
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,360
You seem to be able to get a good massage.

349
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
How about here?

350
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,021
Can you hear me?

351
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,880
There are a lot of nerves here.

352
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,140
Excuse me.

353
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,170
I'll do my best.

354
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,950
Rika-san and Saba-san,

355
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,730
This is a massage for women.

356
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,530
You seem to be in a good mood.

357
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,130
Excuse me.

358
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,450
Do you feel good?

359
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,900
Oh, no!

360
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:40,901
It's a virus!

361
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,060
Do you hate this kind of thing?

362
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,360
You don't hate it, do you?

363
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
Why?

364
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,520
Because it's so serious.

365
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,520
It's OK.

366
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:08,400
I'm not the only one next to you.

367
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,410
It's been two weeks since
we last saw each other.

368
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,590
I think you should have sex.

369
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,030
You'll feel better tonight.

370
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,040
Are you okay?

371
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,300
Is it dangerous?

372
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,820
What's dangerous? I'm not alone.

373
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,200
It's okay.

374
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,500


375
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,390
Riko-san, you look very comfortable.

376
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,460
I'm glad you enjoyed my massage.

377
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:32,461
Are you glad to see me?

378
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,840
What's the matter?

379
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,400
Are you lonely because of your friend?

380
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,980
Are you excited to see him?

381
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,480
Or, Morika-san?

382
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
But,

383
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,100
You get excited when
you see him, don't you?

384
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,740
Actually, your friend is aiming
at your boyfriend, isn't she?

385
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,500
I saw you two talking a while ago.

386
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:37,501
Did you see it?

387
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,280
I'm sure the dog is aiming at you.

388
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,300
You want to do it, don't you?

389
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,510
This is a special massage.

390
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,750
Chikabe's wink is so cute, isn't it?

391
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,890
You haven't taken a
shower for a week, have you?

392
00:32:46,340 --> 00:33:01,540
How do you like my big boobies?
Do you like it?

393
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,420
It's bigger than Rika-san, isn't it?

394
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,940
Look, it's so wobbly.

395
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,480
It's hard here again.

396
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,460
Chinchin.

397
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,520
Can't I do more than this?

398
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,900
I can't, can I? Look.

399
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
It feels good.

400
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,960


401
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,620
Are you having a meal because it's so cold?

402
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Or do you feel good
to be teased? It's hot.

403
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,910


404
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:04,350
Is it dangerous only for you?

405
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,890
You are not alone, so it's okay.

406
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,250
Do you feel good?

407
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,710
You don't want to go
to bed directly, do you?

408
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:26,711
Can you see it? Here.

409
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360


410
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,330
Can you see the boobies here?

411
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,090
Sutan-san, you are twitching a lot.

412
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,430
Oh, you got even more
tired after seeing the boobies.

413
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,550
Sutan-san.

414
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,190
Are you all right?

415
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,790
What are you going to do?

416
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,950
You have a lot of hair.

417
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,730
Are you all right?

418
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,210
This is a mirror.

419
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,030
It is effective to do it while
looking at yourself in the mirror.

420
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,010
Ah!

421
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,630
Ah!

422
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,850
Ah!

423
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,690
Mika-san, you're in a lot of trouble.

424
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,930
Can you see? It's all right.

425
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,330


426
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,610
You can't see from the other side.

427
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,070
It's a magic mirror.

428
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,030
Ah!

429
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,950
That's also a surgery.

430
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,550
Fufu.

431
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,230
She seems to be in a good mood.

432
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,480
You can't eat so soon.

433
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,800
She is being teased.

434
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,700
You have grown up again.

435
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,360
You are so beautiful.

436
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:25,380
She is in a very bad mood.

437
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,400
Riko-san is also in a bad mood.

438
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,510
Are you all right?

439
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,150
You are in a bad mood.

440
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:46,151
Why are you so excited?

441
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,010
Why are you so excited?

442
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:11,010
Do you want to play more?

443
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,250
Rika-san, you are so excited.
You look so comfortable.

444
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
You look so happy.

445
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,960
You are so cute.

446
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
Look down.

447
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,340
Why do you look so happy?

448
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,900
You are so cool.

449
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,840
Are you excited to see Rika-san?

450
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,640
Are you excited to see Sana-san?

451
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
Are you excited to see me?

452
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Please be honest with me.

453
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:04,420
You are amazing.

454
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,500
You are full of energy.

455
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,690
How is it?

456
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,470
Do you feel good?

457
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,270
You don't have to do your best.

458
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,330
Look at her.

459
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,690
She looks comfortable.

460
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,530
She is getting bigger and bigger.

461
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:44,531
I'm going to sleep.

462
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,380
I'm sleepy.

463
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,640
It's chilly.

464
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,060
I'm getting sleepy.

465
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,020
Actually,

466
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,540
there was a medicine
in the tea I just made.

467
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,960
Look at Riku's face.

468
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,560
She looks comfortable.

469
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,180
Oh, you can't do it anymore.

470
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,020
Don't look at me.

471
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:34,021
Don't move.

472
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,900
You have a ring on your finger, don't you?

473
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,180
Imagine that you have
a ring on your finger.

474
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,940
Or I'll take it away with my hand.

475
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,960
It's OK.

476
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:55,961
Are you okay?

477
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,680
You are still holding it.

478
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,800
It's all right.

479
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,060
I'm not going to bite you.

480
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,960
Come on, listen.

481
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,440
You are making a lot of noise.

482
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,980
You are so stubborn.

483
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
What are you going to do?

484
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,360
Rika-san has gone.

485
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
What?

486
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,700
Do you think you are
different from your wife?

487
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,100
Hey, you can go by yourself.

488
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,340
You have a strong sense of justice.

489
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:48,341
You are so cute.

490
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,200
You are sleeping so slowly.

491
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,980
You look sleepy.

492
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,620
How do you feel now?

493
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
Do you feel good? Look at me.

494
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,340


495
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,060
How do you feel?

496
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,080
Ufufu, umfufu,

497
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,640
umfufu,

498
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,960
ughh,

499
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,510
amazing!

500
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,480
Ufufu, I will be a
magical monster,

501
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,580
oh?

502
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,220
It feels good when you do it like this.

503
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,220
But you can't do it anymore, can you?

504
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,840
How is it?

505
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,040
Are you really patient?

506
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,080
I'm sure you've got a lot of hair.

507
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,081
I was surprised.

508
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,920
It's easier to see than before, isn't it?

509
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
I was surprised to see you.

510
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,640
You were surprised, too,
weren't you? Don't worry.

511
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,180
I can only see you from here.

512
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,920
Here you are.

513
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,800
You can't stand it, can you?

514
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,860
You've been doing this for a long time.

515
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
For a long time.

516
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
It's OK.

517
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
It's OK.

518
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,480
You may fall asleep
even if I hold you like this.

519
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,360
Hey, girlfriend.

520
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:23,400
You are amazing.
You have been patient for a long time.

521
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,220
But I want to massage your back.

522
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,520
Then I will lick your back.

523
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:35,521
Do you want to play?

524
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,700
Why?

525
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,820
She is waiting for you.

526
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,660
You will be left alone.

527
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,380
Or do you want to play with me?

528
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,480
I've been watching you
for a long time, haven't I?

529
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,300
Ah!

530
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,850
I knew you were having a romance.

531
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,400
I knew you like boobs.

532
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,660
Look at me closely.

533
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:09,120
Look at my hand.

534
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,500
It feels good.

535
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,540
I feel good, too.

536
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,080
Other girls are also pulling my hair.

537
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,720
It's annoying, isn't it?

538
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:56,120
How is your hand?

539
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,780
Do you want to touch it?

540
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,420
Do you want to
touch it? That's good.

541
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880


542
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,940
Look, it's getting warm again.

543
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,720
Try touching it.

544
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,660
It's getting warm.

545
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:16,661
I'm sorry.

546
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm going to make you feel
better, so please look down at me.

547
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Okay?

548
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,060
I don't know why Rika-san
is in such a good mood.

549
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:26,261
Look at your brother's figure.

550
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:07,660
Can you touch here?

551
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,460
Did you do it yourself?

552
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,780
You did it yourself, didn't you?

553
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:41,040
Are you sleeping?

554
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,460
Do you want me to show you your face?

555
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,180
Do you want me to touch you?

556
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,080
I can't stop it anymore.

557
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:21,820
I can't stop it anymore.

558
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,880
It feels good.

559
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,220
I'm going to cry.

560
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,200
I'm going to cry.

561
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
I'm sorry.

562
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,680
I'm so sorry.

563
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,760
I'm going to be a nurse.

564
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,020
I'm sorry that I have to put up with you.

565
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,260
You can't put up with me
anymore, can you? 「I'm so tired.

566
00:52:25,500 --> 00:53:08,600
」 「I'm so tired.

567
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:17,200
」 「I'm getting
bigger and bigger.

568
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:21,300
」 「Brother.

569
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,160
」 「I'm getting
bigger and bigger.

570
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:40,730
」 Don't worry. You won't
hear the sound of a massager.

571
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,170
You'll feel much better.

572
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:45,171
I'm sorry.

573
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,580
Do you feel good?

574
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:09,581
Do you like it?

575
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:23,480
Do you like it?

576
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:38,020
You are amazing.

577
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,540
You are so big.

578
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,240
So big.

579
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:07,040
Rika-san, you can't bear to
go in front of Ada, can you?

580
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,420
You can't bear it, can you?

581
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,400
I can't bear it anymore.

582
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,610
【The sound of a baby crying】

583
00:55:53,590 --> 00:56:08,120
Are you a baby?

584
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,180
【The sound of a baby
crying】 Oh, you are gone.

585
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,860
You are gone.

586
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:27,260
〔Coughing and sneezing〕

587
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,820
What's wrong?

588
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,500
You don't have to bear it.

589
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:55,501
You don't mind, do you?

590
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:11,750
You are so kind.

591
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,490
What's the matter?

592
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:33,640
You are my friend.

593
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,520
I'm going to start eating now.

594
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,600
I'm going to start eating now.

595
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:51,700
Can you hear a lot of happy sounds?

596
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,990
Do you feel like you are
loved by your mom and me?

597
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,910
Do you feel good?

598
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,310
You are making a great noise.

599
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,210
I will make a noise, too.

600
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,770
Do you want me to do something great?

601
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,550
You do, don't you?

602
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,090
Do you want me to do something great?

603
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:09,091
Look!

604
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:16,880
You got something on your face.

605
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,960
You got something on your face.

606
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,700
I'm going to take it off.

607
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,980
Wow!

608
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,090
Oh!

609
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,930
Oh!

610
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,730
Oh!

611
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,890
How do you feel at home?

612
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,490
Oh!

613
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:03,820
You have a cold.

614
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,980
I can't bear it.

615
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,340
Why do you bear it?

616
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,540
Let's bear it, too.

617
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:36,910
You can't sleep, can you?

618
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:37,911
Are you going to sleep?

619
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,150
Wow!

620
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:41,170
You put the water in your mouth.

621
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,350
Are you a sweet girl?

622
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,690
Do you like to drink water?

623
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,350
Do you feel good? I did my best.

624
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,130


625
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,950
Please do your best.

626
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,630
I feel good, too.

627
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,990
I want you to feel good.

628
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:20,090
This is a heart massage.

629
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:41,130
You are moving by yourself.

630
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,370
You are very energetic.

631
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:48,371
It's OK.

632
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,950
Let's do it again.

633
01:04:52,930 --> 01:05:01,200
I can hear your happiness.

634
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,720
I can hear your happiness, too.

635
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,680
I can hear your heart beating.

636
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,520
We can't lose to you.

637
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:54,910
I love you.

638
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,150
I love you so much.

639
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:02,330
I love you.

640
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,270
Wow! It's amazing!

641
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,130
I was saved!

642
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,700
I'm so happy!

643
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:45,550
I'm so happy!

644
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:49,010
I'm so happy!

645
01:06:51,570 --> 01:07:12,950
Can you touch my butt?

646
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,690
Do you want to touch my butt?

647
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,330
You are so cute.

648
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,230
You are so cute.

649
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:45,730
Who are you?

650
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,010
What are you doing?

651
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,160
Let's make our eyes sparkle.

652
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,620
Can you see me?

653
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,650
Please look at me.

654
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:11,860
Please look at me carefully.

655
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:22,070
I feel great.

656
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:15,650
I'm nervous.

657
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,510
Are you tired?

658
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:40,440
How do you feel? I'm here.

659
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,760


660
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,780
How do you feel?

661
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:46,090
I feel like she is next to me.

662
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:44,290
I feel like she is next to me.

663
01:15:52,110 --> 01:16:04,830
I feel like she is next to me.

664
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,560
Please be rather careful.

665
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:46,430
Please recover your consciousness.

666
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:47,431
It feels good.

667
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,860
Please fall into me without hesitation.

668
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,700
Please, please fall into me.

669
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,390
Please fall into me more.

670
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:49,780
Please fall into me more.

671
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,520
Please fall into me more intensely.

672
01:19:33,790 --> 01:20:00,970
I hope you will feel better
when you catch up with me.

673
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,760
I feel so good.

674
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,520
Please be patient.

675
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,740
I've come this far.

676
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,240
Let's feel better.

677
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,401
Let's get to know each other.

678
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,600
This is a massage that
can only be started in a hotel.

679
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,360
Come closer.

680
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:55,350
If you feel so great,

681
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,490
let's have a meal together.

682
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,430
It feels so good.

683
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,850
I'll go first.

684
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:24,090
It's so intense.

685
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:33,970
What's going on? Sano-san.

686
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,280


687
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,340
Sano-san, you are very tired.

688
01:21:57,341 --> 01:21:58,341
What are you doing?

689
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:04,720
You are being pushed inside.

690
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,180
You are being pushed inside, aren't you?

691
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,020
You want more, don't you?

692
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:24,040
You want more, don't you?

693
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,580
I want you to feel better.

694
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,300
Okuma-chan.

695
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,620
I stopped breathing.

696
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,820
Maybe... Rika-san...

697
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,960
Rika-san's voice is coming out.

698
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,640
Hey, isn't it good that
her voice is coming out?

699
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:09,060
I've been holding it in for a
long time, but it's limitless, isn't it?

700
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:16,860
Please put a lot of
Nishikondometoxin in me.

701
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,760
Please put it out.

702
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Wow!

703
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,560
Wow!

704
01:23:27,561 --> 01:23:31,620
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

705
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,420
Oh, you came earlier than me.

706
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,940
How was it?

707
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:23,560
You felt good, didn't you?

708
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,980
Your face is not red at all.

709
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,140
It was really good, wasn't it?

710
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,720
I really liked it, but...

711
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,380
If you don't mind...

712
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,500
When Rika is busy...

713
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,760
Would you like to come with me?

714
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,940
I'll keep it a secret from Rika.

715
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,980
You won't come, will you?

716
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

717
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:04,660
What were you talking about?

718
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,760
I was talking about how comfortable it was.

719
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,220
Massage?

720
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,520
How was it?

721
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:16,780
It was very comfortable.

722
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:24,360
My shoulders and body became lighter.

723
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,780
My whole body became refreshed.

724
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:30,700
I was talking about coming again.

725
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,980
Yes, I do. I want to come here again.

726
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,920
It's hot.

727
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,760
Yes, it is.

728
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,760
Excuse me.

729
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,940
Thank you for coming today.

730
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,540
Thank you.

731
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,300
How was it?

732
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,480
Yes, it was good.

733
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,560
Thank you.

734
01:27:02,561 --> 01:27:05,681
Thank you very much. Kare-san, how did
you feel when you were in charge of me?

735
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,280
Did you feel good?

736
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,280
Thank you very much.

737
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,700
How about you two? I'm fine.

738
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,120


739
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,300
How about you? Are you okay?

740
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,040
Yes.

741
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:27,980
I'm fine, too.

742
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,140
Thank you.

743
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:29,560
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

744
01:27:29,561 --> 01:27:32,000
We are looking forward to seeing you again.

745
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,600
Please come and see us again,
whether you are alone or with your friends.

746
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,780
Thank you very much.

747
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:45,920
Thank you very much for today.

748
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,180
Thank you very much.
