1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What kind of person is she?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Did you hear any information?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No, I didn't hear much.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No, I didn't hear anything.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But I heard she is a young couple.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, I see.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a little fun.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What kind of person is she?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I hope she is a good person.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why do you doubt so much?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's the most important thing.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It would be nice if we could have fun together.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Welcome.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Please sit down.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please put away your luggage.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Thank you.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Nice to meet you.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Nice to meet you.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My name is Natsuki, and I'm the daughter-in-law of Mr. Otomo and Mr. Kimura.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm Watanabe.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry. I'm not good at this.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm so bored right now. Are you all right?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's been about a year since we've been together, so we've been getting along well since we've been together for a long time.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How long have you been married?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is it still the first year?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Shinko-san!

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nice!

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's the most fun time.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How about you guys?

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's the third year.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's the fourth year.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's been a long time.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's the most fun time, isn't it?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't think so.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We are seniors, so we don't know much about the share house.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We don't know anything.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We don't know much about our house.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Leave it to us.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Have you ever been to a share house like this?

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's my first time.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I feel like I share everything.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I may not get used to it at first.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I want you to say it at all.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm a female ghost.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to talk fast.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Everyone in our share house has a husband and wife.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There is no strict rule.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
For example, there is no sound source.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you don't know, you can ask me anything.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Feel free to ask me anything.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Is your husband busy?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's right. It's a business trip, isn't it?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think I've been here a lot.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
On the contrary, it's better to go together with everyone.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right. I'm relieved.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I think it would be nice to have a wife in the morning.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't worry.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you very much.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you have a business trip, it's better to have a share house than to buy a house.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was wondering if I could do it.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you okay?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm fine.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But it's nice to have one more person.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's true.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's a bit of a hassle.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a bit of a hassle.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Isn't it hard to make four people?

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I agree.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's better to do it like this.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Do you all cook?

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Of course.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you cook?

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's eat vegetables.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Vegetables?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My wife doesn't cook much.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is that so?

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't know.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We didn't do anything.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We didn't.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We didn't.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's the opposite.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's okay.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We're doing it.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We really have to do it like this.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's okay.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm worried.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What about seasoning?

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Seasoning?

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Something salty or soy sauce.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is it okay to use salt?

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Salt?

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm going to leave my luggage in the room for a bit.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good morning.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Welcome back.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Welcome back.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's wrong?

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I lost.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why did you come?

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No, I just wanted to say something.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you doing?

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why?

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is this the last one?

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Nami-san, you should stop patting.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Because I've never heard that I won today.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You can't say that you won.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, that's right.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I won today.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, you really won?

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's unfair.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think you should win next time.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sure I'll win next time.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's do it together.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is that so?

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I lost.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sure I'll win next time.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sure I'll win next time.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sure I'll win next time.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sure I'll win next time.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mr. Watanabe seems to have won today.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Did you win?

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Did you use it or not?

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I used it to make my own sound.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I see.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's talk for a while.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's talk for a while.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You really used it.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you use it?

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was hit by a shiitake mushroom.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Next day

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is your wife's, isn't it?

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, this is mine.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Thank you.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Please fold it properly.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What? It's properly folded.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it?

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No, it's fine.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I heard that it's a method that doesn't fit the wrinkles.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I saw it on TV the other day.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You believed it.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I didn't know it at all.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's okay now.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't get it wrong.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're wearing a lot of underwear these days.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Really?

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Me too.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wait a minute.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't wear underwear.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Compared to when we first started, we've gotten much better at folding, haven't we?

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's it.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll put it in the box.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Welcome back.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, you're here.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have to hurry up and get ready.

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Welcome back.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have to get ready.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
From today?

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have to go out from now on.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have to get ready.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You have to get ready again.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm lonely.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's hard.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think so too.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It happens a lot.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It might be a long night.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Which one?

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have to hurry.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's okay.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Leave it to me.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll take care of it.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Have a nice day.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Have a nice day.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a very important thing.

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I know.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Shinichi doesn't have a business trip.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't think so.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The children are very busy.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is it a business trip?

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a business trip.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a long way from here.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, I see.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But you know,

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
we've got a new husband and wife,

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so I thought we could share

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
what we've been up to

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
on the weekends.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was thinking of sharing

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
what we've been up to.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I wonder if he'll come back

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
on the weekends.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I wonder when he'll be back.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There is a possibility that it will be a good business trip.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What will you do if you don't come back?

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Only your wife.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't say it.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Didn't Tatsuki say it?

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I didn't say it.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Even if someone suddenly said it, I didn't say it.

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I thought you two had already talked about it.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I didn't say it.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was surprised when you suddenly said that.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I thought it was the atmosphere.

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I thought you were going to say that.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, did you say that?

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I didn't.

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You didn't say that.

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you used to it?

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm fine.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What?

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, it's a pity.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, if everyone is together,

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
next week or next week.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Next week,

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
if the timing is good.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like this.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, it's easy.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's easy, isn't it?

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think we missed the right timing.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's true.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think there's something wrong.

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's better not to put it on.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I agree.

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Can you clean this up?

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Can I ask you a favor?

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not bent.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You guys are going to close it.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's going to be clean.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Leave it to me.

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's clean now.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't roll over.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I thought you were going to roll over.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry. I'll leave it to you.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, no.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you ready?

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm ready.

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's about time for the plane to arrive.

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's so sudden.

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's right, I'm feeling a little lonely.

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I feel lonely again.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We'll make up again.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
See you later.

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Thank you.

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's go.

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I feel lonely.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There are always a lot of people like that.

272
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Suddenly?

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How many times a month do you go on a business trip?

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Every week?

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's amazing

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But it's hard, isn't it?

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Every weekend you go on business trips

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But do you take a day off before going on a business trip?

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm pretty busy now

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Since I moved to a new department

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm busy

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When I was young, I had a lot of business trips.

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There was a business trip course.

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, that's right.

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's right, that's right.

287
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't want to go on a business trip like a child.

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm jealous.

289
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm jealous.

290
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
When I was young, I went on a business trip to China.

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's a good girl.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please don't do it anymore.

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The water is overflowing.

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm going to take a step back.

295
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Please don't do it anymore.

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If something happens,

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm really worried.

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Please don't do it anymore.

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm lonely.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I thought it would take about three days.

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Three days is quite a lot, but

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I think this week will be a little longer.

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm looking forward to it.

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a party-like atmosphere, isn't it?

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's not a welcome party, but I wanted you to know the feeling of this place.

306
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry, I'll ask you again.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,400
Well, let's do it when everyone is here.

308
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
We can do it at the same time.

309
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Yes, that's right.

310
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
What?

311
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
You ate it, didn't you?

312
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I just came here a few days ago, so I couldn't keep up with you.

313
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I see.

314
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
It's a little...

315
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
What?

316
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,400
When I came here with my friends, it was quiet, wasn't it?

317
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
I knew it.

318
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Or were you doing it with me?

319
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I didn't hear it.

320
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
You didn't hear it?

321
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
No.

322
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Maybe it's just the beginning.

323
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
You're right.

324
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
You're right.

325
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Are you full?

326
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I'm waiting for you.

327
00:16:50,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm getting wet right away.

328
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
What should I do?

329
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,400
What should I do?

330
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm still embarrassed.

331
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I want to play with you.

332
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,580
No, I'm happy to play with you.

333
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
He's already grown up.

334
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
I'm going to do it.

335
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
I'm embarrassed.

336
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
I avoided it.

337
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
No, you didn't.

338
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Are you nervous?

339
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,740
I won't throw it away.

340
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Are you sure?

341
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Yes, I'm sure.

342
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Does it feel good?

343
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Is it good?

344
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Oh, it's good.

345
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
It was hard.

346
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
It's not good.

347
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
I thought it was still good.

348
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Oh, I see. I'll do it properly.

349
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
I'll open it.

350
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Oh, it feels good.

351
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Oh, that's dangerous.

352
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Oh, that's dangerous.

353
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Oh, that's dangerous.

354
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
Oh, that's dangerous.

355
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
Oh, no.

356
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Oh, it feels good.

357
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Oh, it's hot.

358
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Oh, it feels good.

359
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Oh, it's hot.

360
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,740
You said you were weak.

361
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,740
It's so good.

362
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Please continue.

363
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh, no.

364
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
That's right.

365
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
No.

366
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Oh, no.

367
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,740
Oh, I'm going.

368
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
My stomach hurts.

369
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
Oh, no.

370
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,240
It hurts.

371
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
It hurts.

372
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Did you drink it?

373
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
I did.

374
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,740
I didn't expect you to come out here.

375
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
It's too early.

377
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Are you still fine?

379
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
I'm fine.

380
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Let me see.

381
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
I think you were talking about this.

382
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,740
What? I haven't heard about this yet.

383
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,740
You were talking about something.

384
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
You're hitting me.

385
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
No way.

386
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,740
I like this part, too.

387
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,740
I like this part, too.

388
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Really?

389
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,740
I like your bangs, too.

390
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
I didn't mean to say that.

391
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Oh, it comes out naturally.

392
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
From the top of the pouch?

393
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
From the top of the pouch?

394
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,740
You want me to do it directly, right?

395
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
Well, then...

396
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Well, isn't it better if you do it the way you like it?

397
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Oh...

398
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
What should I do, then?

399
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
What's wrong?

402
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
I can't do it.

403
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
Wait.

404
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm going to say that right away.

405
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
What?

406
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,740
Did you really go?

407
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
Wow, amazing.

408
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
I'm embarrassed.

409
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740
Are you embarrassed?

410
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
I don't like it.

411
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
Give me more.

412
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
You want more?

413
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Yes.

414
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
Then give me your butt.

415
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
My butt?

416
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
I love your butt.

417
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Really?

418
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
You like it too?

419
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Yes.

420
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
I see.

421
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,740
You like it too, don't you?

422
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
It's hot.

423
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
It's very slimy.

424
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
There's a lot of it coming out.

425
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,740
I can't do it anymore.

426
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Amazing.

427
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,740
You like it here, don't you?

428
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Wait, I want to sleep again.

429
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
What should I do?

430
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,740
She's a genius, isn't she?

431
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,740
She's getting better day by day.

432
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,740
But it feels good to be the wife of Mr. Matanabe.

433
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Hey, I want to put it in.

434
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Can you put it in for me?

435
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Yeah.

436
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,740
Let's do it.

437
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,740
Actually, I thought you were licking me.

438
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
You should have told me earlier.

439
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,740
I'm hungry.

440
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll give you some water.

441
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,740
How do you feel?

442
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
I feel good.

443
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Oh, that's great.

444
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,740
You feel good today, don't you?

445
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Do you feel good?

446
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
I don't feel good.

447
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,740
If you lie down like this, it will be tight.

448
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
That's right.

449
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
Can I lie down?

450
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
I'm tired.

451
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
You're fast.

452
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
You did a good job.

453
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,740
You did a good job.

454
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Did you put in a lot?

455
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,740
It came out a lot.

456
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Is it good?

457
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Is it good?

458
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
It feels good.

459
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Put it in.

460
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
Put it in.

461
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Oh, no.

462
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,740
It feels good inside.

463
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,740
After all, when you put it in in a row, is it different from the feeling you put in?

464
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,740
It's different.

465
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,740
It's the same for some people.

466
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,740
But it feels good for others.

467
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
I'm sorry.

468
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
I told you not to touch it.

469
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,740
It doesn't fit.

470
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
It's the same as before.

471
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
It doesn't fit at all.

472
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
That's amazing.

473
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740
It feels good when you clean it up.

474
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,740
I don't want to talk to you.

475
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
If you want to go out, please go out.

476
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,740
Is that all right?

477
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Please go out.

478
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Mr. Wakame's wife is quite a gentleman, isn't she?

479
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,740
That's right.

480
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,740
Ah, it feels good.

481
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Oh, it's cold.

482
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Oh, it's cold.

483
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
It's hot.

484
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Oh, it feels good.

485
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Oh, why does it feel so good?

486
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,740
Did you sleep well?

487
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Did you put a lot of water in it?

488
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,740
Did you put a lot of water in it?

489
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Which one did you put more water in?

490
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Which one did you put more water in?

491
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
It's a good match.

492
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
It's a good match.

493
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
Isn't it a little less?

494
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
It's not like that.

495
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,740
It's not like that?

496
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,740
I sweated a little, so I took a shower.

497
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,740
Do you want to take a bath?

498
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
I think it's a good idea.

499
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Do you feel good?

500
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Yes, I feel good.

501
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,740
I'm going to take a bath.

502
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Hey, hey.

503
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,740
It's good.

504
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,740
It's the best to be quiet.

505
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,740
You were so good at it.

506
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
I'm so happy.

507
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,740
I know it.

508
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
What?

509
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,740
It feels good.

510
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,740
Oh no!

511
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Oh no!

512
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Oh no!

513
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,740
Oh no!

514
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,740
Oh no!

515
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
I'm going to fall over...

516
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
Oh no!

517
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
No?

518
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
I'm not falling over!

519
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
Well, it's not too bad to have a heart like that.

520
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
Oh no!

521
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Oh no!

522
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,740
Oh no!

523
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,740
Oh no!

524
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Wait a minute.

525
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,740
Amazing.

526
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
It's so painful.

527
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,740
It's so hot today, isn't it?

528
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,740
No way.

529
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
What is this?

530
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,740
Wait a minute.

531
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,740
I'm going to burn.

532
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
It's going to close.

533
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
Wait a minute.

534
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
Oh, it's painful.

535
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
I'm in a bad mood.

536
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Show me your face when I take it out.

537
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
What kind of face are you making?

538
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
What should I do?

539
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Did you take it out already?

540
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
I took it out.

541
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Next.

542
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm sorry.

543
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
You are sleeping.

544
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
I don't like it.

545
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
You should be patient.

546
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
I'm not confident.

547
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Why?

548
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I'm looking forward to it for a long time.

549
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I'll be patient.

550
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
I'm not confident.

551
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Can I hold you?

552
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Yes, you can.

553
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
This feels good.

554
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
I can't breathe.

555
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
Let's do it right away.

556
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I think I'm in a good mood today.

557
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Oh, it's hot.

558
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Oh, it's hot.

559
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm going to take a picture of you.

560
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
You have a lot of blood on your face.

561
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
I have a lot of blood on my face.

562
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
I like this

563
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
It hurts

564
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I love it so much

565
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
It feels so good

566
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
No...

567
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Wait!

568
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Ugh!

569
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Ugh!

570
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
I feel sick!

571
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Ugh!

572
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Ugh!

573
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Your face is great!

574
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Ugh!

575
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
I can't do this!

576
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Ugh!

577
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
I can't do this anymore!

578
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
I feel sick!

579
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
No!

580
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Ouch!

581
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Ouch!

582
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Ouch!

583
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Ouch!

584
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Ouch!

585
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Ouch!

586
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Oh, it still hurts.

587
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Why does it hurt so much?

588
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
It's just that it feels good.

589
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
It feels good.

590
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Eh?

591
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
You have more hair, don't you?

592
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Eh?

593
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
But it felt good.

594
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
It felt good.

595
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Really.

596
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Well, then.

597
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You still have more hair.

598
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Ah!

599
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Eh?

600
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
You've already had more.

601
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
No, no, no.

602
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You can still do it.

603
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
It was good.

604
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Your hair is so good.

605
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I'm not good at it.

606
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
I'm good at it.

607
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
I've touched it.

608
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Really?

609
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Which one?

610
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
This one.

611
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
It's over now.

612
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
It's over.

613
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
I'm going to touch it.

614
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
I'm going to touch it all the time.

615
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Why are you laughing so much?

616
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,480
I usually do it.

617
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,480
But it's interesting, isn't it?

618
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,480
It's completely different from drinking a cup of coffee.

619
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Is it different?

620
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,480
The two of you are wonderful.

621
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,480
I'm sorry.

622
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,480
You know Chikkun is weak, don't you?

623
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I know.

624
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
You're getting angry.

625
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm getting angry.

626
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
You're happy, aren't you?

627
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
You're happy, aren't you?

628
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
You hate me.

629
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Oh, really?

630
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
You're worrying too much.

631
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Look.

632
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Even if you say that, my husband is...

633
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
You're worrying too much.

634
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,480
I want to touch you somehow.

635
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
We're both men, aren't we?

636
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
You can't do it?

637
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Can you do it again?

638
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
What?

639
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Can you do it again?

640
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
What?

641
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Are you still fine?

642
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I'm fine.

643
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Hey, you're hitting me.

644
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
I'm hitting you too.

645
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
You're hitting me a lot.

646
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
That's right.

647
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
You're hitting me a lot.

648
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
You're not angry, are you?

649
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
What?

650
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
You're hitting me a lot.

652
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Did you talk to her?

653
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Not yet.

654
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Oh, you haven't talked to her yet?

655
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
No, I haven't.

656
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Oh, I see.

657
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,480
I don't know.

658
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,480
I wonder if I'll be able to talk to her one day.

659
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I don't know.

660
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
What should I do? I should tell her.

661
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
You should tell her in advance.

662
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,480
If I don't tell her, she'll feel sorry for me.

663
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,480
Well, it's true that she feels sorry for her friends.

664
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
What should I do?

665
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
The timing to come back is like that, isn't it?

666
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Yeah.

667
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Then, can you talk to your wife?

668
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,480
I want to talk to her first.

669
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Ah, but...

670
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I don't want to talk to you.

671
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Oh, sorry, sorry.

672
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
My fingers are burning all the time.

673
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Then, let's talk when we eat.

674
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Yeah.

675
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Then, let's go.

676
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Yeah.

677
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Cheers!

678
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
Cheers!

679
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Cheers!

680
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I wanted to drink it.

681
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Cheers!

682
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,480
It looks good but I'll give it some more sleep.

683
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Ah, it's delicious.

684
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
I don't have a husband, though.

685
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
It's a girls' party.

686
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
It's nice sometimes.

687
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,480
I enjoy that kind of thing.

688
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
I'm not alone, so I can drink more.

689
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
I can talk all the time.

690
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,480
If you drink too much, you'll get angry.

691
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
I used to drink a lot.

692
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,480
That's right.

693
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
How have you been recently?

694
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
I've gotten used to it.

695
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,480
I've gotten used to it.

696
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,480
I've gotten used to it.

697
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,480
You're not with me anymore.

698
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
You're not with me anymore.

699
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Are you lonely?

700
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,480
I'm lonely.

701
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480
It's been a year.

702
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,480
I'm lonely.

703
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
When we were in the same room,

704
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,480
I was alone.

705
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,480
You're alone now?

706
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,480
I see.

707
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Yeah.

708
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
But you know,

709
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
sometimes you can have fun

710
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,480
because you're her husband, right?

711
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Yeah.

712
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480
I haven't been

713
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480
staying at home

714
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
that much lately.

715
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
I've seen it many times.

716
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,480
We haven't seen it either.

717
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,480
It's like that.

718
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
In the end, it may not be the most familiar to the husband.

719
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I agree.

720
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,480
It's like a little hard to get in.

721
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480
But it's not like that at all.

722
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,480
I don't know anyone.

723
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,480
I'm glad.

724
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,480
If you're too busy,

725
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,480
It's kind of difficult to be with you all the time.

726
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Certainly.

727
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,420
And it makes you pitiful views...

728
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,580
No, I want to be with her a little longer.

729
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,320
I want to be spoiled.

730
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,300
�본루 wanna be spoiled?

731
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,380
Is it going to be a contact between soft skin and soft skin?

732
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,180
It's 많이 decaying, isn't it?

733
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,520
What are you doing?

734
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,520
I'm not tired at all.

735
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,520
I'm tired even when I come back.

736
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,520
I feel like I'm tired.

737
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Do you have a day like that?

738
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
Do you take a video?

739
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,520
I don't think so.

740
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,520
I haven't taken a video since I came here.

741
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,520
I haven't taken a video since I came here.

742
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,520
You don't have to tell me.

743
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
I'm not going to tell you.

744
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
I'm not going to tell you.

745
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,520
I'm not going to tell you.

746
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
I'm not going to tell you.

747
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,520
I'm going to get tired from the beginning.

748
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
I see.

749
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,520
I'm not sure.

750
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
I'm not sure.

751
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,520
It's been a year, right?

752
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Yes.

753
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,520
I'm not sure.

754
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
I want you to change your job.

755
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,520
That's my true intention.

756
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,520
I think I have

757
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,520
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

758
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,520
I don't know what to do.

759
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
That's not good.

760
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
We've been living together for a long time.

761
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
That's right.

762
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,520
If you're here, you can work.

763
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,520
Is that possible?

764
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,520
What are you two doing?

765
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
I don't know what to do.

766
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
I don't think it's hard at all.

767
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
I feel like I'm doing it.

768
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
Everyone is having fun.

769
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
That's right.

770
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
I'm not stressed at all.

771
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
I'm jealous.

772
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520
Is there anything you want to do?

773
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
There is.

774
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
Yeah, that's right.

775
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
There's no one who doesn't have one.

776
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
What are you going to do?

777
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Are you going to put it on for me?

778
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,520
I want to.

779
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
You want to?

780
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Yes, I want to do it.

781
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,520
This is a share house, right?

782
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
So we can share a lot of things.

783
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,520
It's a rule that you can share everything.

784
00:48:39,520 --> 00:49:01,520
We don't support each other, but in that sense, we share a lot of things, and if we lack something, we can compensate for it, so we can share it with our husbands.

785
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
Eh? Husband?

786
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
Husband

787
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,520
What do you mean?

788
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Well, I can be with my husband, but I can be with my wife too

789
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
I can be with Kimura too

790
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
I can be with this

791
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:31,520
That's why the four of us are living well together.

792
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:41,520
I'm glad that you came here.

793
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,520
We've been living together for a long time.

794
00:49:45,520 --> 00:50:01,520
It was the first time we did it together on the New Year's Day, but we didn't get to do it together, so we were alone for a long time.

795
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:10,520
I wish we could get to know each other better.

796
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,520
What do you think?

797
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
I still can't feel it.

798
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
I can't feel it at all.

799
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,520
That's right.

800
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,520
I can't imagine it.

801
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,520
But

802
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,520
My husband is like that,

803
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,520
I think he's going to hit the jackpot today, right?

804
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,520
But

805
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Hit the jackpot, lose,

806
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
It's a quick recovery.

807
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,520
Because it's like that.

808
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,520
So

809
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,520
In many ways, she is fast in recovering.

810
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Yeah, in many ways.

811
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,520
She is fast in recovery.

812
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
She has a lot of changes.

813
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,520
Yeah, yeah.

814
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,520
My husband is like that.

815
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
Yeah, he's got a lot of patience.

816
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,520
He just lets me do it.

817
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,520
I'm not like my husband at all.

818
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,520
If you're okay with it.

819
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
I'm not like that.

820
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,520
It's lonely, isn't it?

821
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,520
You can't be alone.

822
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
You can't do that.

823
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
You have to share.

824
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
Share house.

825
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,520
I don't think I've ever experienced it before.

826
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,520
I think it's fun.

827
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
Are you nervous?

828
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,520
Are you okay?

829
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
Let's have a drink.

830
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,520
I'll be back soon.

831
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,520
Where did you go?

832
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
I don't know.

833
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Oh, welcome back.

834
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,520
Welcome back.

835
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
It started to rain.

836
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,520
I see.

837
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
We're taking a nice walk.

838
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,520
It's better than the story.

839
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,520
What?

840
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,520
It's perfect.

841
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
What?

842
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Actually...

843
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
Did you drink?

844
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,520
We had a girls' party.

845
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,520
We talked about it.

846
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Oh, really?

847
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,520
I'll do my best.

848
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,520
I'm back.

849
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,520
What?

850
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Right away.

851
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,520
That's right.

852
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
I'll definitely use this.

853
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,520
What color do you want?

854
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
What color do you want?

855
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
Pink is better.

856
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Do you want to make it pink?

857
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,520
This is a rule.

858
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,520
I'll definitely use it.

859
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,520
Thank you.

860
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,520
It's a little embarrassing for us, isn't it?

861
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,520
Thank you very much.

862
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Thank you very much.

863
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,520
It's embarrassing.

864
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
What is it?

865
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,520
Do it properly.

866
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
It's okay.

867
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
Show me the man.

868
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,520
See you.

869
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,520
Be kind.

870
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
I don't understand.

871
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
He left.

872
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Kotomo-san, are you sure you don't mind?

873
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,520
Yes.

874
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Well, if you say yes, I won't refuse.

875
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,520
This is what our share house looks like.

876
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,520
You're lonely, aren't you?

877
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
You're married for the first time in a year.

878
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,520
What do you like about her?

879
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,520
Please tell me if you have something you like.

880
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
I want to be attacked a lot.

881
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
Do you like being attacked?

882
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
It's embarrassing.

883
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,520
It's embarrassing.

884
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,520
We're the only ones here.

885
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:57,520
Natsuki and Nata-Nabe, please be careful.

886
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
I'm going to open the door for you.

887
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:09,520
I haven't been teaching recently.

888
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,520
That's right.

889
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Isn't it closed here?

890
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,520
The boobs are big and beautiful.

891
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,520
How do you like being kissed?

892
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,520
It's very easy to feel.

893
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:47,520
You don't have to hold back your voice at all, it's okay.

894
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,520
It's okay.

895
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,520
Is it okay to hold it so strongly?

896
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,520
It's true.

897
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Is it shaking?

898
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:48,520
I feel like I'm about to puke.

899
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
Is this it?

900
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
I'm about to puke.

901
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,520
I'm sorry.

902
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
I'm sorry.

903
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,520
It's just started.

904
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,520
Stand up.

905
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
Let's take this off.

906
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
I'm sorry.

907
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
I'm sorry.

908
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
Here.

909
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
Are you okay?

910
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,520
Here

911
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,520
Give me your hand

912
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,520
I was surprised

913
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Please sit down

914
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,520
There are a lot of holes in the buttocks and gums.

915
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,520
I want to do this when I'm being watched.

916
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,520
If I get licked...

917
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,520
It hurts!

918
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,520
It hurts!

919
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,520
It hurts!

920
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,520
It hurts!

921
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,520
I knew it!

922
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,520
You're so into it!

923
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
You're so into it!

924
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:50,520
This is the first time I've ever seen such a beautiful view in my life.

925
01:00:50,520 --> 01:01:00,520
This is the first time I've ever seen such a beautiful view in my life.

926
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,520
After I changed my wife and started to have sex with her,

927
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,520
we didn't have sex at all.

928
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,520
Thank you.

929
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:52,520
Oh, it hurts.

930
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,520
You're amazing.

931
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,520
I'm very good.

932
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,520
Really?

933
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,520
Yes.

934
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,520
Here.

935
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
Is it okay?

936
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,520
Yes, it's okay.

937
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:40,520
Oh, it feels good.

938
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,520
Haven't you done anything like this since you got married?

939
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:41,520
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in a bad mood.

940
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,520
Please sit down.

941
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,520
Get on the mat

942
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,520
Get on the mat?

943
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:49,520
Natsuki and Tanabe are very good at making tea.

944
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,520
Tomo-san, you haven't lost yet.

945
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,520
Feels good.

946
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,520
I'm sorry.

947
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
Does it feel good?

948
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,520
I'm glad.

949
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,520
I wonder.

950
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,520
Wait.

951
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,520
I'm going to take a bath.

952
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,520
I like it.

953
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
It's like my husband is a mannequin.

954
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,520
What's with that hand?

955
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,520
It was good.

956
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,520
Now everyone can do it.

957
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,520
I'm going to do it well.

958
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
I want to put it in.

959
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,520
What?

960
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,520
I want to put it in.

961
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,520
You want to put it in?

962
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,520
How do you feel?

963
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Can I ride it?

964
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,520
Oh, that's good.

965
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,520
May I come in?

966
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,520
I'm sorry.

967
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,520
You look calm, but you're very aggressive.

968
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,520
It's been a long time.

969
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,520
I'm so sorry.

970
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,520
I'm sorry.

971
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,520
I'm sorry.

972
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
I'm so sorry.

973
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,520
She's trying to hold it in.

974
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,260
That feels good.

975
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,560
You can't hold it in.

976
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,800
I can't.

977
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,760
You can't?

978
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,800
I can't hold it in.

979
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,800
I'm just going to leave you alone.

980
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,800
You can't hold it in.

981
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,800
You can't hold it in.

982
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
Let's go!

983
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Let's go!

984
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,800
Let's go.

985
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,800
Let's go.

986
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
I'm scared.

987
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,800
I'm scared.

988
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
I'm scared.

989
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,800
I'm surprised.

990
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,800
I feel like I'm being dragged by a woman.

991
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,800
I feel like I'm being dragged by a woman.

992
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,800
She hasn't stopped yet.

993
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,800
It feels good.

994
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

995
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
I want to do it, too.

996
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
Oh, really?

997
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Oh, I see.

998
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
Oh, I see.

999
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,800
This one is also very cute.

1000
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
Oh, I see.

1001
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,800
Hey, let's share it.

1002
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,800
Hey, let's share it.

1003
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
Hey, let's share it.

1004
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
Then, what should we do?

1005
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,800
I wonder if he will eat it.

1006
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
Then, what should we do?

1007
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
There are only two men.

1008
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,800
Then, let's lie down.

1009
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,800
Then, let's lie down.

1010
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,800
Then, let's lie down.

1011
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,800
You can do it!

1012
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,800
If you do this, can't everyone lick it?

1013
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,800
I think I can lick it.

1014
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,800
Right?

1015
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,800
Right?

1016
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Wow, it's so flat.

1017
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
How do you feel?

1018
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
How do you feel?

1019
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
Not yet.

1020
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
You're still holding it in?

1021
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
I'm holding it in.

1022
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
It feels so good.

1023
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
Wow.

1024
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,800
Umm...

1025
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
Huh?

1026
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
Umm...

1027
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,800
Oh, it feels good.

1028
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
Oh...

1029
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Oh...

1030
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
It feels good.

1031
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Oh...

1032
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Oh...

1033
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
Hmm...

1034
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
Hmm?

1035
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Oh...

1036
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Hmm...

1037
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
Eh?

1038
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
It's delicious!

1039
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,800
It's delicious, so you can lick it.

1040
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,800
I'm a little wet.

1041
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,800
How do you feel?

1042
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,800
Are you good at licking?

1043
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,300
It's getting stronger.

1044
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,100
She's still moving.

1045
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:22,100
I can't stand it anymore.

1046
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:27,100
I can't stand it anymore.

1047
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:03,100
How is my husband's kiss?

1048
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,100
It's too big.

1049
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,100
I'm sorry.

1050
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,100
It's too big.

1051
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,100
Oh, it's hot.

1052
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,100
Here, here, here.

1053
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,100
Do you want a kiss?

1054
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,100
No matter how you lick it, it's good for your health.

1055
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,100
Oh, no.

1056
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,100
Let's do it again.

1057
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,100
It's good.

1058
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,100
It's okay to put it in the middle, isn't it?

1059
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,100
Because it's the most important part.

1060
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,100
I don't know which one to lick.

1061
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,100
You can lick both.

1062
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,100
You can lick it.

1063
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,100
What is it?

1064
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,100
Oh, I'm scared.

1065
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,100
Who is it?

1066
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,100
What? Do you want me to pet you?

1067
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,100
Hey!

1068
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,100
You can't eat it.

1069
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,100
It looks delicious.

1070
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,100
You're spilling it all over the place.

1071
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,100
It's been spicy for a while.

1072
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,100
You can't eat it.

1073
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,100
It's just a little bit.

1074
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,100
Just a little bit?

1075
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,100
Add all of this.

1076
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,100
That's it.

1077
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,100
That's what I like.

1078
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,100
Delicious!

1079
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,100
It's the first time.

1080
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,100
You're attacking us.

1081
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,100
What are you talking about?

1082
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,100
I want you to play with the three of us.

1083
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,100
Of course.

1084
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,100
Come on.

1085
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,100
They are trying to run away.

1086
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:01,100
You are rubbing the bottom of the sofa.

1087
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,100
How hard were you?

1088
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,100
You have a good view.

1089
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,100
What are you doing?

1090
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,100
What are you doing?

1091
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,100
What are you doing?

1092
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,100
It feels good.

1093
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,100
What are you doing?

1094
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,100
I'm sorry.

1095
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,100
I'm just licking you.

1096
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,100
I'm sorry.

1097
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,100
I'm sorry.

1098
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,100
I can't do it anymore

1099
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,100
It feels so good

1100
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,100
Oh, it's hot!

1101
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Oh, it feels good!

1102
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,600
Oh, it's cold!

1103
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
I'm sorry.

1104
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
I'm sorry.

1105
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
I'm being punished.

1106
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,600
I'm sorry.

1107
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,600
I'm being punished.

1108
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,600
Turn the other way.

1109
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Turn the other way.

1110
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,600
I'm so sorry.

1111
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,600
I'm so sorry.

1112
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
I'm so sorry.

1113
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
I'm sorry.

1114
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
I'm sorry.

1115
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,600
I'm sorry.

1116
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,600
I'm sorry.

1117
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,600
I'm sorry.

1118
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Why are you making that sound?

1119
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
What's wrong with you?

1120
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,600
My legs...

1121
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,600
Oh, come on.

1122
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,600
Oh, I'm scared.

1123
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Oh, come on.

1124
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,600
I'm sorry.

1125
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,600
I love you.

1126
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,600
I love you.

1127
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,600
I love you.

1128
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,600
Are you tired?

1129
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,600
It's hard.

1130
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,600
It's really hard.

1131
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,600
Are you OK?

1132
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,600
But it looks hard.

1133
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,600
It's harder than Tamae-san.

1134
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,600
It's harder than Tamae-san.

1135
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,600
I'm going to say it.

1136
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,600
It's cute.

1137
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,600
Kotomo-san, do you feel good?

1138
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
Yes, I feel good.

1139
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,600
Which one is the best?

1140
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,600
This is the best!

1141
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,160
I want to put it in my mouth

1142
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:23,160
No, you didn't put it in your mouth a while ago

1143
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,160
I want to put it in again.

1144
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,160
Let's put it in a little more.

1145
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,160
Then wait a minute.

1146
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,160
Don't do that.

1147
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
Can you put it on?

1148
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,160
Thank you very much.

1149
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,160
Can you see it?

1150
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,160
Oh, it's stuck.

1151
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,160
Hey, I'm going to put it in here.

1152
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,160
I'm going to put it in.

1153
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,160
I'll make sure you see it today.

1154
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,160
I'm sleepy, so I'm going to put it in until tomorrow.

1155
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,160
Can I put it in?

1156
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,160
Of course.

1157
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,160
It's coming straight.

1158
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,160
Show me.

1159
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,160
Oh, it's amazing.

1160
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,160
I don't like it.

1161
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,160
You're different from my boyfriend, aren't you?

1162
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,160
You're going to fall asleep here.

1163
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,160
I'm okay.

1164
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,160
Is it because of your desire?

1165
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,160
Maybe.

1166
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,160
It's okay.

1167
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,600
Wow, oh no...

1168
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,320
It's really...

1169
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,040
He is really frightened.

1170
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,960
This is a situation for both of them.

1171
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Are you feeling OK?

1172
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,860
Wow.

1173
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,860
What are you doing?

1174
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,860
Do you want a hug?

1175
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,860
Let's stay still.

1176
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,860
It feels hot.

1177
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,860
I want to go to the bathroom.

1178
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,860
I understand.

1179
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,860
I understand.

1180
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:27,860
Then, I will change the place.

1181
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:29,860
I will change the place.

1182
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,860
What should I do?

1183
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,860
I will change the place.

1184
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:36,860
I will change the place.

1185
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,860
Really?

1186
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:40,860
I want to change the place.

1187
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,860
Oh, it's hot.

1188
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,860
Hey, it's a little too sudden.

1189
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,860
It's a little too sudden.

1190
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:04,860
It's a little too sudden.

1191
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:09,860
It feels so good.

1192
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,860
Oh no, I can't do it like that.

1193
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,860
It's not great today.

1194
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,860
It's going in, it's going in

1195
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,860
What the hell wild

1196
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,880
No no I think I'll go

1197
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,880
it's wonderful

1198
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,880
You should have asked me to do it.

1199
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,880
I want to tell Motohara-san again.

1200
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,880
Do you want to exchange it again?

1201
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,880
Let's exchange it.

1202
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,880
That's right.

1203
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:58,880
You want to be in it too, don't you?

1204
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,880
You're so cute, aren't you?

1205
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,880
You're so cute, aren't you?

1206
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,880
I can't open it.

1207
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,880
I can't open it.

1208
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,880
I can't open it.

1209
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,880
It's overflowing.

1210
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
It's overflowing.

1211
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
Over there.

1212
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,880
It feels good.

1213
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,880
It's overflowing.

1214
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,880
It's overflowing.

1215
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,880
It's overflowing.

1216
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,880
What are you doing?

1217
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,880
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared

1218
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
Are you okay?

1219
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,880
I'm sorry!

1220
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,880
I was so happy!

1221
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,880
It was so fun!

1222
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,880
So sorry.

1223
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,880
I'm so sorry.

1224
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
I'm so sorry.

1225
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,880
My nose is runny.

1226
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,880
I'm sorry.

1227
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,880
I'm sorry again.

1228
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,880
I'm sorry.

1229
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,880
painful

1230
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,880
painful

1231
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,880
painful

1232
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,880
painful

1233
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,880
painful

1234
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,880
painful

1235
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,880
painful

1236
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,880
painful

1237
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,880
painful

1238
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,880
I'm so scared.

1239
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,880
I'm so sorry.

1240
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,880
I'm so scared.

1241
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,880
I'm so scared.

1242
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,880
I'm so tired.

1243
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,880
I'm so tired.

1244
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:34,880
You still want to do it, don't you?

1245
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,880
Yes, I want to do it.

1246
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,880
Do you want to do it?

1247
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,880
I want to have more fun.

1248
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
What is this?

1249
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,320
It's empty.

1250
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,880
You used too much.

1251
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,080
You didn't buy it, did you?

1252
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,440
No, I didn't buy it.

1253
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,760
I forgot to buy it.

1254
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,640
I don't think it's going to disappear at such a high speed.

1255
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:05,520
I wonder if it's going to be like that when you put it together.

1256
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,080
What should I do?

1257
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,080
Do you want to do it raw?

1258
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,840
Do you want to do it raw?

1259
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,840
Let's go to the other side.

1260
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,840
Let's go to the other side.

1261
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,840
What are you going to do?

1262
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,840
Here we go.

1263
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,840
Here we go.

1264
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,840
Don't do that.

1265
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,840
Don't do that.

1266
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:51,840
I feel so good.

1267
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
I'm so tired.

1268
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,840
Why?

1269
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,840
Why does it feel so good?

1270
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,840
Can you see?

1271
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,840
Ah, I can't see anything.

1272
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,840
Ah, I can't see anything.

1273
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,840
Ah, I can't see anything.

1274
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,840
Ah, I can't see anything.

1275
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1276
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,840
Eh, you seem like you're looking at something very closely.

1277
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,840
It's good, right?

1278
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,840
Ah, it's painful!

1279
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,840
Ah, it's painful!

1280
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,840
It's painful!

1281
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,840
It's really painful!

1282
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
Ah, it's so painful!

1283
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
Please stop!

1284
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
Ouch!

1285
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

1286
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:17,840
What?

1287
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,840
You were making a lot of noise.

1288
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,840
What did I do?

1289
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
I'm sorry...

1290
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,840
I'm sorry...

1291
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
I'm sorry...

1292
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,840
Please stop...

1293
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
sorry...

1294
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
I'm sorry...

1295
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,840
I'm sorry...

1296
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,840
I feel good...

1297
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
You're right...

1298
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,840
You're going so fast...

1299
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
You're going too fast...

1300
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,840
I'm sorry...

1301
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
So sorry...

1302
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
It hurts!

1303
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,840
I can't breathe.

1304
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,840
Oh, no.

1305
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,840
You look like you're going to cry.

1306
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
I'm going to take it out.

1307
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
Oh, my God.

1308
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
Oh, my God.

1309
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,840
Where is it?

1310
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,840
There's a lot of it.

1311
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
Oh, my God.

1312
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
Oh, my God.

1313
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,840
It's coming off.

1314
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,840
Did you get it dirty?

1315
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,840
Can I clean it up again?

1316
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,840
I'm sorry.

1317
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,840
I'm sorry. You have a lot of hair.

1318
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,840
I'm sorry.

1319
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,840
Can I cry?

1320
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,840
I envy you.

1321
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,840
Are you jealous?

1322
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,840
I envy you.

1323
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,840
I'm behind you.

1324
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,840
Let's go.

1325
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,840
I'm sorry.

1326
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,840
What?

1327
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,840
I'm sorry.

1328
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,840
I'm sorry.

1329
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
I'm sorry.

1330
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
I'm sorry.

1331
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,840
I'm sorry.

1332
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,840
Here we go!

1333
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,840
Oh, it feels good.

1334
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,840
Oh, it feels good.

1335
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,840
I'm going to go.

1336
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,840
I'm going to go.

1337
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,840
I'm going to go.

1338
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:50,840
Oh, it feels good.

1339
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,840
My heart is beating fast.

1340
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,840
Isn't it the first time?

1341
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,840
That's right.

1342
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,840
Are you all right?

1343
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,440
I want to see it, I want to see it.

1344
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:12,440
Oh, it's coming out.

1345
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:16,440
Wow, there's a lot of it.

1346
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:21,440
Wow, I haven't been able to take it out yet.

1347
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,440
It's cute.

1348
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,440
Are you okay?

1349
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,440
Did you feel good?

1350
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:33,440
I'm glad.

1351
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,440
It's not enough yet.

1352
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
It's not enough yet.

1353
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,440
Do you want to do more?

1354
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,440
It's not enough yet.

1355
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,440
It's not enough yet.

1356
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,440
It's not enough yet.

1357
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,440
It's not enough yet.

1358
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,440
It feels good.

1359
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,440
I'm sorry.

1360
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:03,440
You were playing with the ball a while ago.

1361
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:07,440
I was playing with the ball here too.

1362
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,440
That's also possible.

1363
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,440
Thank you.

1364
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,440
I'm sorry.

1365
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,440
I'm sorry.

1366
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,440
I'm about to die!

1367
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,440
It hurts!

1368
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,440
It hurts!

1369
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,440
Wait a minute!

1370
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,440
Show me!

1371
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,440
It's coming out!

1372
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,440
Amazing!

1373
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,440
It's coming out!

1374
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,440
Yeah.

1375
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,440
If you get drunk with a cup again, you'll be like this.

1376
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,440
It's a memorial.

1377
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,440
Yeah, that's right.

1378
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:26,440
But what if the baby comes?

1379
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,440
Well, at that time, at that time.

1380
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,440
At that time?

1381
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,440
We'll cooperate.

1382
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,440
Yeah, yeah.

1383
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,440
We can cooperate.

1384
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1385
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,440
What?

1386
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,440
It was really great.

1387
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:45,440
I'm so happy for you guys.

1388
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,440
Let's meet again.

1389
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:51,440
I want to meet everyone.

1390
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:03,440
I hope I can get home early.

1391
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,440
I'm so happy.

1392
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,440
I'm home.

1393
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,440
You're back.

1394
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:14,440
Good job.

1395
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,440
You're ready to go to bed.

1396
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,440
I haven't slept yet.

1397
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:20,440
Really?

1398
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,440
Today,

1399
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:26,440
I was scolded by my boss.

1400
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,440
Were you scolded?

1401
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,440
Well, it's a mess.

1402
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,440
Hey, what's that?

1403
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,440
Look at this.

1404
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,440
When did you buy this?

1405
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,440
The other day.

1406
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:50,440
Show me more.

1407
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,440
It's really good.

1408
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,440
Take the back.

1409
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:04,440
The back?

1410
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,440
What's going on?

1411
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,440
Are you feeling better?

1412
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:21,440
I forgot that you were angry at me.

1413
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,440
That's not good.

1414
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,440
Don't do that.

1415
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,440
That's not good.

1416
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,440
Do you want to eat?

1417
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,440
I want to eat.

1418
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:58,440
I was going to take a bath, but I thought it would be okay to take a bath later, so I decided to take a bath.

1419
01:51:58,440 --> 01:51:59,440
What?

1420
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,440
No?

1421
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,440
No.

1422
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:06,440
When I see you dressed like that, I can't stop thinking about you.

1423
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,440
I'm excited.

1424
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,440
Do you like me?

1425
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,440
What is it?

1426
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,440
It's delicious.

1427
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,440
Is it delicious?

1428
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,440
What is it?

1429
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,440
You're so cute.

1430
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,440
Hey.

1431
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:29,440
It looks like Mr. Otomo is back.

1432
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,440
Oh, Mr. Otomo.

1433
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,440
How's business?

1434
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,440
Oh, sorry.

1435
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,440
Sorry.

1436
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,440
Wait a minute.

1437
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:45,440
How is my school?

1438
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:55,440
I want you to take a look.

1439
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:58,440
Please enter.

1440
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,440
Please enter without holding back.

1441
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,440
Can I see this side too?

1442
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,440
You scared me.

1443
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,440
It's okay.

1444
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,440
Come here.

1445
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,440
It's okay.

1446
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,440
You don't have to worry.

1447
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,440
As expected.

1448
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,440
Look, isn't it so beautiful?

1449
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,440
I'm surprised.

1450
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,440
You're making such a loud voice.

1451
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,440
You're excited because your father is watching, aren't you?

1452
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,440
I didn't mean to bother you.

1453
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,440
You don't mind if I bother you, do you?

1454
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,440
Not at all.

1455
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,440
Don't worry about it at all.

1456
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,440
Oh, could it be...

1457
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:58,440
It's not boobs.

1458
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,440
Oh, is it this way?

1459
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,440
I want to see it.

1460
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,440
Hey, Kinra-san.

1461
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,440
As expected.

1462
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,440
Why is that?

1463
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,440
Huh?

1464
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,440
Hey, Natsuki.

1465
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:18,440
What?

1466
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:21,440
Use your right hand to pick up a big one.

1467
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,440
Is that okay?

1468
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,440
It's transparent.

1469
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,440
I'm sorry.

1470
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,440
You're mean.

1471
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,440
I'm going to buy clothes.

1472
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:36,440
I want you to see it.

1473
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:40,440
I want you to see it.

1474
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,440
Let's be told so.

1475
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,440
What do you think of my wife's clothes?

1476
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:49,440
Even if you ask me how I feel, I want to hear your impressions.

1477
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:54,440
I think it's very beautiful.

1478
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,440
As expected, it's beautiful.

1479
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:00,440
I'm happy.

1480
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:02,440
I wonder if I should buy a more amazing one next time.

1481
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:05,440
What? A more amazing one?

1482
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,440
I'll buy an open one.

1483
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,440
That's a good idea.

1484
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,440
Who is it?

1485
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:13,440
Who is it?

1486
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,440
It's a little damp.

1487
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:21,440
I'm so excited.

1488
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,440
Is it because your father is watching?

1489
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,440
Did you fall asleep?

1490
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:28,440
Yes.

1491
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:32,440
If you react like this...

1492
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:34,440
Is this comfortable?

1493
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,440
There is a place that Otomo-san didn't show you.

1494
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,440
What?

1495
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,440
Buttocks, buttocks.

1496
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,440
That's just what you want to see.

1497
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,440
Come on, come on, come on.

1498
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:20,440
Amazing, isn't it?

1499
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,440
There is a button here.

1500
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,440
Yes.

1501
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:30,440
It opens.

1502
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:32,440
Let's take it off later and have Oman-kun see it.

1503
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,440
Oh, I see.

1504
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:36,440
As expected.

1505
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:37,440
As expected?

1506
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,440
As expected, what is it?

1507
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,440
I don't touch it.

1508
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,440
That's not it.

1509
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,440
Do you want to touch it?

1510
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,440
Wait a minute.

1511
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,440
It's okay.

1512
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,440
Look.

1513
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,440
Please touch it.

1514
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,440
My hands are full of sweat.

1515
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,440
Really?

1516
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,440
I'm nervous.

1517
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,440
Let's ask your father to touch your buttocks.

1518
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:28,440
I like to be licked on my buttocks in this outfit.

1519
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:02,440
I shared a room with your wife.

1520
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:08,440
Yes, me, Atanabe, and your wife.

1521
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:12,440
I felt sorry for your wife.

1522
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,440
I opened the girls' room.

1523
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:18,440
I was lonely.

1524
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:23,440
This is a share house where couples live.

1525
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:30,940
That's why she shares her husband and wife with each other.

1526
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:35,140
Well, it's just a little bit edgy, isn't it?

1527
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:37,820
That's right.

1528
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:39,440
If you put it simply,

1529
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:43,440
Atsuma's wife looked like she was having a lot of fun, didn't she?

1530
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,440
It looks like she's cleaning up.

1531
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,740
It's very intense.

1532
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:47,640
It's very intense.

1533
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:49,140
She's swinging her hips.

1534
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,640
She's my wife.

1535
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:52,640
It was very aggressive.

1536
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,640
It was very aggressive.

1537
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:58,640
I was asked to put it in, but I also asked for it.

1538
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:00,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1539
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:04,640
Oh, then I can't do it.

1540
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,640
That's what I mean.

1541
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:11,640
I understand.

1542
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:18,640
I don't think you're going to get an oxen from here.

1543
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:25,640
Please don't mind it at all and touch it.

1544
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:34,640
Is that okay?

1545
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:39,640
What are you doing?

1546
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:41,640
What are you doing?

1547
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:43,640
Are you hiding something?

1548
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:47,640
No, I'm not.

1549
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:50,640
You live under the same roof, don't you?

1550
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,640
You don't need to hide anything.

1551
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:55,640
No, I'm not.

1552
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,640
What are you hiding?

1553
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:01,640
Wait a minute.

1554
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:03,640
It's okay.

1555
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:06,640
I don't want you to be so stiff.

1556
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,640
Look at that.

1557
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,640
It's big.

1558
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:15,640
I knew it.

1559
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:22,640
You thought it was good to see us, didn't you?

1560
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:26,640
You were worried, weren't you?

1561
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:28,640
Natsuki is so smart.

1562
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:31,640
She loves to lick the chimp.

1563
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:36,640
She likes it and she's good at it.

1564
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,640
Wow, amazing.

1565
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:44,640
You want to lick it quickly, right?

1566
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,640
Please, please.

1567
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:49,640
Otomo-san.

1568
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:52,640
Please let Otomo-san lick the chimp.

1569
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,640
No, wait a minute.

1570
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:58,640
If you don't say no, it's fine, isn't it?

1571
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,640
Oh, that's right.

1572
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:05,640
Look, look.

1573
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,640
Otomo-san, stand up, stand up.

1574
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,640
What? What?

1575
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,640
Stand up, stand up.

1576
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:10,640
It's like standing on two feet.

1577
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,640
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1578
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:15,640
Look, take that hand.

1579
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:19,640
Amazing.

1580
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:22,640
Then, look at my boobs.

1581
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:28,640
Oh, it's so big.

1582
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:33,640
I want you to touch me with your wet hands.

1583
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:04,640
It's good.

1584
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,640
You're good at this, aren't you?

1585
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:15,640
It's a little...

1586
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:25,640
Are you sure you're okay?

1587
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,640
Oh, it's totally fine.

1588
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:39,640
Natsuki is happy.

1589
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:45,640
You're happy, aren't you?

1590
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:47,640
It's so good, man.

1591
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:08,640
I love you so much.

1592
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,640
It's dirty.

1593
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:42,640
What is this?

1594
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:45,640
I want you to touch it.

1595
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:49,640
I'm the only one who hasn't been shared.

1596
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:51,640
That's right.

1597
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,640
This is a button, isn't it?

1598
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:01,640
Yes.

1599
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:04,640
Please take this off.

1600
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:08,640
You don't have to take it off.

1601
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:42,640
Otomo-san, you are much more gentle than I thought.

1602
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:46,640
You forgot about Mowataki, didn't you?

1603
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:50,640
I got carried away.

1604
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:56,640
Natsuki likes to be teased or licked with her fingers.

1605
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:58,640
I like both.

1606
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,640
Can you do it with your finger?

1607
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:20,640
It feels good, doesn't it?

1608
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:23,640
Oh, my God.

1609
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:37,640
It's all thanks to your husband that you're so healthy.

1610
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:40,640
That's right.

1611
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:43,640
You're so wet here.

1612
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:46,640
Look at this.

1613
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,640
It's so warm.

1614
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,640
Are you licking it?

1615
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,640
Yes.

1616
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,640
Is it good?

1617
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:58,640
Can I lick it?

1618
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:00,640
Please, please, please

1619
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,640
How is it?

1620
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:20,640
It's really hard

1621
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:25,640
I have a lot of things to do except for my wife

1622
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:27,640
Is it good?

1623
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,640
It's delicious.

1624
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:31,640
It's delicious.

1625
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:39,640
It feels good.

1626
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,640
It feels good.

1627
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:53,640
I feel so good.

1628
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:57,640
Oh my god.

1629
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:00,640
I felt like I was going to die.

1630
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:08,640
I should have gone earlier.

1631
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,640
I should have gone earlier.

1632
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:13,640
I should have gone earlier.

1633
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:18,640
You want to go, don't you?

1634
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:21,640
I can't do it anymore.

1635
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:23,140
I can't do it anymore.

1636
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:31,640
I can't do it anymore.

1637
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:34,640
kawaiる

1638
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:39,640
kawai gaat

1639
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:48,640
kawaii

1640
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,640
kawai generalized

1641
02:09:56,640 --> 02:10:00,640
Please make me like you a lot.

1642
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:05,640
You ate it.

1643
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:11,640
You are amazing today.

1644
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,640
You are always wet.

1645
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:17,640
Wow!

1646
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:19,400
Amazing!

1647
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,740
You're getting wet more than usual.

1648
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:31,140
I'm going to put my finger in.

1649
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:33,640
Can I put it in?

1650
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:35,640
Can I put it in?

1651
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:36,640
Ah...

1652
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:38,940
Come out.

1653
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,640
Ah...

1654
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:41,640
Ah...

1655
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,640
Ah...

1656
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:45,140
Ah...

1657
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:47,140
Ah...

1658
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:48,640
Ah...

1659
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:51,140
Ah...

1660
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:52,140
It feels good.

1661
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:53,140
It feels good.

1662
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:54,140
Ah...

1663
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:55,140
Ah, that was good.

1664
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,140
I feel good.

1665
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:57,140
You're good.

1666
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:58,140
Ah...

1667
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,140
Ah...

1668
02:10:59,140 --> 02:11:00,140
Ah...

1669
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,140
Ah...

1670
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:02,140
Ah...

1671
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:03,140
Ah...

1672
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:04,140
Ah...

1673
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:05,140
Ah, amazing.

1674
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:07,140
This is amazing...

1675
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:15,140
I shouldn't have done that...

1676
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:19,140
It feels so good...

1677
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:25,140
It's hot...

1678
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:27,140
It's hot...

1679
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:29,140
Oh, it's painful.

1680
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:36,140
Oh, it's painful.

1681
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:52,140
It hurts.

1682
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:54,140
I'm pinching you.

1683
02:11:58,140 --> 02:12:00,140
You're amazing.

1684
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:05,140
Don't you want to lick Otomo's chin again?

1685
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:07,140
I want to lick a lot.

1686
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:12,140
What are you planning?

1687
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:14,140
I want to lick you.

1688
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:18,140
You don't need this anymore, do you?

1689
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:23,140
You can lick your father's chimp as it is.

1690
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:24,140
I'm sorry.

1691
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:31,140
You can lick your father's dick.

1692
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:03,140
Oh, my God.

1693
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:06,140
It's so fluffy.

1694
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:11,140
I didn't know you were hiding this.

1695
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:21,140
Can I play with you?

1696
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:23,140
I'm dizzy

1697
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:52,560
Oh...

1698
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:53,820
Oh...

1699
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:54,820
Oh...

1700
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:56,020
Oh my god...

1701
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:57,900
I'm so sorry, I feel bad...

1702
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:59,340
Oh my god...

1703
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:01,340
Oh...

1704
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:05,680
I wonder if I can sleep like this...

1705
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,680
Oh...

1706
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:08,020
I think I can't...

1707
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:09,020
Oh...

1708
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:10,020
Oh...

1709
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:11,020
Oh...

1710
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,020
Oh...

1711
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:13,020
Oh...

1712
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,020
Oh...

1713
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:15,020
I feel bad...

1714
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:16,020
Oh...

1715
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:17,020
Oh...

1716
02:15:17,020 --> 02:15:18,020
Oh...

1717
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:19,020
Oh...

1718
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,020
Oh...

1719
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:52,020
Are you okay?

1720
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:54,020
I was busy.

1721
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:58,020
Were you saving it for your wife?

1722
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:00,020
Well...

1723
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:02,020
I'm sorry.

1724
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:04,020
I might have stolen it earlier.

1725
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:08,020
She seems to be enjoying it.

1726
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:10,020
I feel good.

1727
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:16,020
I'm scared.

1728
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:19,020
Oh, it's so good.

1729
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:34,020
You seem to be very happy.

1730
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:40,020
It's so big.

1731
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:44,020
I think it's going to fall off.

1732
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:47,020
Of course.

1733
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:50,020
I've been waiting all day today.

1734
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:52,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1735
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:54,020
What?

1736
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:56,020
Hmm?

1737
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:58,020
Yeah!

1738
02:16:58,020 --> 02:17:00,020
And...

1739
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:02,020
See?

1740
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:04,020
It's okay.

1741
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:06,020
I'm wearing a rubber band.

1742
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:09,020
Recently, in our share house...

1743
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:12,020
It's a rule that there's no rubber.

1744
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:16,020
I think it doesn't matter what it is.

1745
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:20,020
We're all good friends.

1746
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:33,020
It's my first time.

1747
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:35,020
I'm happy.

1748
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:38,020
Are you excited about Hajime chin chin?

1749
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:39,020
Yes, I am.

1750
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:40,020
Oh, I see.

1751
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:41,020
You are so small.

1752
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:42,020
Here we go.

1753
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:56,020
Oh, it's hot.

1754
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:57,020
Oh, no.

1755
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:00,020
It's hot.

1756
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:01,020
It's hot.

1757
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:05,020
I'm glad you're happy to be able to move your body.

1758
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:08,020
He touched your boobs, licked them, and kissed you.

1759
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:10,020
Are you okay?

1760
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:46,020
Oh, it feels so good.

1761
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:48,020
It feels so good.

1762
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:58,020
I had a heart attack when you came in.

1763
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:06,020
I love you.

1764
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:07,020
Really?

1765
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:09,020
Ah, I don't feel so good

1766
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:15,020
Ah, no

1767
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:18,020
Ah, I feel so good

1768
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,020
Ah, so low, so low

1769
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:33,020
I feel so good, right?

1770
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:38,020
I want to make you feel better.

1771
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:41,020
I want to make you feel better.

1772
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:51,020
Come here.

1773
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:59,020
You make people who are tired move, don't you?

1774
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:18,020
Does it feel good?

1775
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:28,020
It's shaking a lot.

1776
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:32,020
It's shaking a lot just looking at it, isn't it?

1777
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:36,340
It fell off.

1778
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:50,200
I feel so good

1779
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:54,240
I'm about to faint

1780
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:56,580
OK OK

1781
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:58,580
It's been a long time. Did you hear that?

1782
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:00,580
I love you so much.

1783
02:22:02,580 --> 02:22:06,580
I'm glad you entered the western house.

1784
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:08,580
Yes.

1785
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:10,580
I'm about to go.

1786
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:13,580
I can't do anything.

1787
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:15,580
I'm scared.

1788
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:21,460
No way, she's completely wiggling

1789
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:29,000
Huh?

1790
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:32,900
What are you mumbling about?

1791
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:33,780
Then I'll

1792
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:35,960
put a pitcher in

1793
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:38,960
Do you want me to put it in?

1794
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:49,960
Oh, it's okay.

1795
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,960
It's a fish.

1796
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,960
Oh, it's amazing.

1797
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:01,960
It feels good.

1798
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:04,760
Ah, I'm feeling really hot!

1799
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:07,760
Ah, no! It hurts!

1800
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:09,760
Ah, it's hot!

1801
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,360
Ah!

1802
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,560
Ah...

1803
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:13,360
Ah...

1804
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:14,560
Ah...

1805
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:15,560
Ah...

1806
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:16,760
Ah...

1807
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:17,760
Ah...

1808
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:18,960
Ah...

1809
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:20,160
Ah...

1810
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:21,760
Ah...

1811
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:22,760
Ah...

1812
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:23,960
Ah...

1813
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:25,760
Ah, that's...

1814
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,760
Ah, that angle...

1815
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:29,560
Ah...

1816
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:30,160
Ah...

1817
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:31,360
Ah...

1818
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:33,360
Oh, it feels good.

1819
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:41,360
Oh, it's rubbing.

1820
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:44,360
It's rubbing.

1821
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:47,360
Oh, it feels good.

1822
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:53,360
Oh, no.

1823
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:55,360
You'll be a good girl.

1824
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:59,360
Oh, no.

1825
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,360
I'm a little jealous.

1826
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:06,360
But I love you the most.

1827
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:13,360
Oh, it hurts.

1828
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:14,360
Ouch!

1829
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:23,480
Oh, you sound great.

1830
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:54,480
What?

1831
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,480
Oh, I'm not feeling well.

1832
02:25:57,480 --> 02:25:58,480
Oh, more.

1833
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:00,480
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1834
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:01,480
Ah! Ah!

1835
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:03,480
I'm starting to feel sick.

1836
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:05,480
Oh, no. I'm going to laugh.

1837
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:08,480
Oh, no. I'm going to start to feel sick, too.

1838
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:09,480
Ah!

1839
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:10,480
Ah!

1840
02:26:11,480 --> 02:26:13,480
Ah! Ah!

1841
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:15,480
Ah!

1842
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:17,480
Ah!

1843
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:18,480
Ah!

1844
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:19,480
Ah!

1845
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:20,480
Ah!

1846
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:22,480
I'm scared.

1847
02:26:30,980 --> 02:26:31,980
What?

1848
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:34,980
You just let it out?

1849
02:26:34,980 --> 02:26:37,980
I just let it out.

1850
02:26:37,980 --> 02:26:38,980
I'm sorry.

1851
02:26:42,980 --> 02:26:44,980
I can't do it anymore.

1852
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:45,980
I'm sorry.

1853
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:47,980
Huh? But it's okay.

1854
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:54,980
Oh, I see.

1855
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:57,980
Did you fall asleep?

1856
02:26:58,980 --> 02:27:02,980
Well, when I saw it, I got excited too.

1857
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:06,980
Look, look, look. I'm going to stick out my buttocks.

1858
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:10,980
But you haven't put it in yet, have you?

1859
02:27:10,980 --> 02:27:12,980
Yes, that's right.

1860
02:27:19,980 --> 02:27:21,980
Is this your father's spirit?

1861
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:24,980
Did it overflow?

1862
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:28,980
Wow, it feels good.

1863
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:35,980
Oh, my God.

1864
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:40,980
Use both hands and open your hips.

1865
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:52,980
You like this, don't you?

1866
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:54,980
I love it.

1867
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:57,980
Why?

1868
02:27:57,980 --> 02:27:59,980
I can't believe it.

1869
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:01,980
It's not my fault.

1870
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:03,980
I'm sorry.

1871
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:05,980
I don't know what to do.

1872
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:06,980
I see.

1873
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:08,980
I'm sorry.

1874
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:10,980
You're a good boy.

1875
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:12,980
I'm sorry.

1876
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:14,980
I'm sorry.

1877
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:16,980
I'm sorry.

1878
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:18,980
I'm sorry.

1879
02:28:18,980 --> 02:28:20,980
I'm sorry.

1880
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:22,980
I'm sorry.

1881
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:24,980
I'm sorry.

1882
02:28:24,980 --> 02:28:26,980
I'm sorry.

1883
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:59,980
Go, go, go!

1884
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:06,980
It's been a while since I felt so good.

1885
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:08,980
Hold on!

1886
02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:40,980
I can't do it anymore!

1887
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:49,980
That's a loud voice.

1888
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:52,980
I can't do it anymore.

1889
02:30:52,980 --> 02:30:58,980
The person who's sleeping is probably already sleeping.

1890
02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:00,980
I can't do it anymore.

1891
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,980
I can't do it anymore.

1892
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:05,980
I can't do it anymore.

1893
02:31:05,980 --> 02:31:07,980
You can't do it anymore?

1894
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:09,980
There's nothing we can do about it.

1895
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:11,980
In that case...

1896
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,980
Come on.

1897
02:31:13,980 --> 02:31:15,980
Ah...

1898
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:17,980
Ah...

1899
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:19,980
Ah...

1900
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,980
Ah...

1901
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:23,980
Ah...

1902
02:31:25,980 --> 02:31:27,980
Ah...

1903
02:31:27,980 --> 02:31:29,980
Ah...

1904
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:31,980
Ah...

1905
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:35,980
Ah...

1906
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:07,980
I want to kiss you, mom.

1907
02:32:14,980 --> 02:32:15,980
Oh, no.

1908
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:17,980
I love you.

1909
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:18,980
Can I take this out?

1910
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:20,980
I'll take it out.

1911
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:24,980
Wait a minute.

1912
02:32:24,980 --> 02:32:26,980
Go, go, go.

1913
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:27,980
Ah!

1914
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:31,980
Ah! Wait! Ah!

1915
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:33,980
Ah!

1916
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:34,980
Ah!

1917
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:37,980
It's okay. It's all okay.

1918
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:05,980
Ah...

1919
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:07,480
Ah...

1920
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:08,980
I...

1921
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:10,980
I'm going to sleep one more time.

1922
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:12,980
Are you sure?

1923
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:13,980
Yes.

1924
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:17,980
Ah...

1925
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:19,480
Ah...

1926
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:20,980
Hmm...

1927
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:22,980
Ah...

1928
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:24,980
Ah...

1929
02:33:26,980 --> 02:33:27,980
Ah...

1930
02:33:27,980 --> 02:33:28,980
Ah...

1931
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:29,980
Ah...

1932
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:32,980
You're like your mother-in-law.

1933
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:34,980
I'm sorry.

1934
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:41,980
I feel terrible.

1935
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:49,980
I'm sorry.

1936
02:33:49,980 --> 02:34:07,920
Do your best!

1937
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,580
Nice!

1938
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:11,580
I'm so tired.

1939
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:15,580
I'm so tired.

1940
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:18,580
I'm so tired.

1941
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:33,580
Did I get a lot of stuff again?

1942
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:37,580
I've been standing here for so long.

1943
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:39,580
It's so hard to breathe.

1944
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:43,580
Wait.

1945
02:34:47,580 --> 02:34:49,580
I can't do this.

1946
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:51,580
Oh no!

1947
02:34:51,580 --> 02:34:53,580
Oh no!

1948
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:55,580
Oh no!

1949
02:34:55,580 --> 02:34:57,580
It hurts!

1950
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:59,580
Ah!

1951
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:01,580
Ah!

1952
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:03,580
Go go go!

1953
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:05,580
Ah!

1954
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:07,580
Ah!

1955
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:09,580
Ah!

1956
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:11,580
Ah!

1957
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:13,580
Ah!

1958
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:15,580
I'm so tired!

1959
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:17,580
I'm not good today.

1960
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:24,580
If you do something like that, I'll go right away, right?

1961
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:26,580
Hmm

1962
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:28,580
Huh

1963
02:35:28,580 --> 02:35:30,580
Ah Ah

1964
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:32,580
Ah

1965
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:34,580
Zzz

1966
02:35:34,580 --> 02:35:36,580
Hmm

1967
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:38,580
Zzz

1968
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:42,580
Typing

1969
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:44,580
Typing

1970
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:46,580
Typing

1971
02:35:46,580 --> 02:35:48,580
Typing

1972
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:50,580
Typing

1973
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:52,580
Typing

1974
02:36:22,580 --> 02:36:23,580
I feel good.

1975
02:36:26,580 --> 02:36:27,580
From behind.

1976
02:36:27,580 --> 02:36:28,580
From behind?

1977
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:30,580
You don't want to put it in?

1978
02:36:35,580 --> 02:36:37,580
It's amazing.

1979
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:40,580
You're so aggressive.

1980
02:36:40,580 --> 02:36:42,580
I'm so happy.

1981
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:44,580
I'm so happy.

1982
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:46,580
I'm so happy.

1983
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:48,580
I'm so happy.

1984
02:36:48,580 --> 02:36:50,580
I'm so happy.

1985
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:53,920
It feels so good.

1986
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:01,400
It's incredible.

1987
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:20,820
There, it feels good.

1988
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:29,720
There, it feels good.

1989
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:30,720
Ah!

1990
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:31,720
Ah, right.

1991
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:34,720
That girl is so full of energy.

1992
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:35,720
Ah...

1993
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,720
Ah...

1994
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:38,720
Ah...

1995
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:42,720
I have no chance of getting out of here...

1996
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:43,720
Ah...

1997
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:44,720
I have...

1998
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:45,720
Ah!

1999
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:49,720
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

2000
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:53,720
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ah!

2003
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:01,720
Ah! Ah!

2004
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:09,720
Ah...

2005
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:12,720
Ah!

2006
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:15,720
Ah! Ah!

2007
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:19,720
Don't play with me.

2008
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:21,720
Oh, no!

2009
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:25,720
Oh, no!

2010
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:27,720
I'm so tired!

2011
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:29,720
I'm so tired!

2012
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:49,720
I'm so tired!

2013
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:22,980
Ah...

2014
02:41:22,980 --> 02:41:25,760
Ah...

2015
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:25,960
Ah...

2016
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:26,000
Ah...

2017
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:26,060
Ah...

2018
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:28,640
Ah...

2019
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:29,120
shorter

2020
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:30,060
Ah...

2021
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:34,120
Ah...

2022
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:36,400
Ah ah ah ah왔

2023
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:37,620
Oh ah

2024
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:42,860
Oh no

2025
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:44,240
Oh yeah

2026
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,420
Ah, okay

2027
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:48,720
Ah ah ah

2028
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,460
Ah! Yes!

2029
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:50,620
Ah! Ah! Ah!

2030
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:51,780
Ah ah ah!

02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:53,040
Ah! Ah!

2032
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:53,540
Go.

2033
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:54,380
Ahh...

2034
02:41:54,380 --> 02:41:55,400
It feels so good.

2035
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:57,340
Ah, ah!

2036
02:41:57,340 --> 02:41:59,020
I love it so much!

2037
02:41:59,020 --> 02:42:00,800
심

2038
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:02,640
Um, um!

2039
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:04,480
Go.

2040
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:05,620
Ahh!

2041
02:42:05,620 --> 02:42:06,100
Ah!

2042
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:06,900
Ah!

2043
02:42:07,900 --> 02:42:09,280
Oh my god!

2044
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,500
Ahh, ah!

2045
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,180
Uh! Ah!

2046
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:14,960
So much ice cream!

2047
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:15,460
Go!

2048
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:16,540
Ah

2049
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:17,120
Ahhh

2050
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:17,920
Ah

2051
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:18,240
Ah!

2052
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:20,240
It hurts!

2053
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:54,240
That was too much.

2054
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:00,240
I'm going to die.

2055
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:01,240
You were nervous?

2056
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:04,240
I died because I was too nervous.

2057
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:07,240
I still want to give it to you.

2058
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:14,240
I'm tired.

2059
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:18,240
You're amazing.

2060
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:23,240
Oh, my husband is flying away.

2061
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:25,240
He's flying away.

2062
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:35,240
Look at this.

2063
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:37,240
Oh, my God.

2064
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:45,240
It's amazing.

2065
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:50,240
I'm telling you that I'm dead, but I'm still shaking my back like this.

2066
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:52,240
I can't do it anymore.

2067
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:01,240
I can't do it anymore.

2068
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,240
There are so many mosquitoes.

2069
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:35,240
Ahhhh!

2070
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:37,240
Nooo!

2071
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:39,240
Ahhhh!

2072
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:41,240
Nooo!

2073
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:43,240
Ahhhh!

2074
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:45,240
Ahhhh!

2075
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:47,240
Ahhhh!

2076
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:49,240
Ahhhh!

2077
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:51,240
I'm done.

2078
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:53,240
Everyone in the sharehouse will wake up.

2079
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:55,240
I'm sorry.

2080
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:57,240
Because

2081
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:59,240
I'm so

2082
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:01,240
tired of

2083
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:09,240
It's all because of you guys.

2084
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:11,240
It's all my fault.

2085
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:17,240
It feels good.

2086
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:23,240
I love you, Jin-chan.

2087
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:25,240
You love me?

2088
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:26,240
I love you

2089
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:32,240
Where are you?

2090
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:33,240
There's a dog

2091
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:37,240
You're scratching the door

2092
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:39,240
I can't do it

2093
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:46,240
It hurts

2094
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:47,240
Oh, no.

2095
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:55,240
Oh, no.

2096
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:05,240
Oh, no.

2097
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:07,240
I don't like this.

2098
02:47:37,240 --> 02:48:02,020
Yes, that's it, that's it.

2099
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:06,800
Look at that, it's blown up.

2100
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:08,800
It's over here.

2101
02:48:15,800 --> 02:48:17,800
You're too much.

2102
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:26,800
I can't do it.

2103
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:28,800
I can't do it anymore.

2104
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:29,800
What?

2105
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:30,800
I can't do it anymore.

2106
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:31,800
You can't do it anymore?

2107
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:33,800
I can't do it anymore.

2108
02:48:33,800 --> 02:48:37,600
But you have to say thank you to your friend.

2109
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:39,800
That's right.

2110
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:44,800
Natsuki, wake up.

2111
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:47,800
Thank you for your friend.

2112
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:51,800
Thank you too.

2113
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:53,800
It's amazing.

2114
02:48:53,800 --> 02:48:55,800
No, it's nothing.

2115
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:59,800
Next time, let's all cheer together.

2116
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:02,800
Natsuki, please.

2117
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:13,800
Next time, we'll share the room with Mr. and Mrs. Naotomo, and Mr. and Mrs. Watanabe.

2118
02:49:15,800 --> 02:49:18,800
It's gonna be fun!

2119
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:22,800
We'll all be in the same room.

2120
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:24,800
Share house.

2121
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:28,800
I'm so happy.

2122
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:31,800
Of course, I'm looking forward to it.

2123
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:34,800
You might not be able to sleep because you're looking forward to it.

2124
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:35,800
That's true.

2125
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:37,800
You're going to do it again, aren't you?

2126
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:39,800
That might be a good idea.

2127
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:43,480
Thank you. That's all for today.
