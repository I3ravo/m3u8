1
1.33 --> 5.33
 Hey, why are you staring at me?

2
14.58 --> 79.78
 Is that not for me?

3
80.78 --> 84.35
 Give it to me.

4
92.08 --> 93.08
 It's delicious.

5
94.08 --> 97.08
 It's not fair to keep it to yourself.

6
97.08 --> 107.24
 What are you looking at?

7
146.30 --> 147.30
 It's yours.

8
147.30 --> 148.30
 It's yours.

9
149.30 --> 249.18
 So this is what you're looking at.

10
249.18 --> 254.22
 You want me to help you.

11
254.22 --> 259.07
 I've never seen you like this before.

12
260.07 --> 263.07
 But I didn't know there was such a cute girl.

13
264.07 --> 268.75
 On your own?

14
271.75 --> 273.75
 I didn't know that.

15
276.90 --> 278.90
 I don't get it.

16
278.90 --> 287.90
 What are you trying to do?

17
292.13 --> 293.13
 What?

18
302.35 --> 304.35
 So this is what you're like.

19
309.22 --> 367.66
 You're cute.

20
368.66 --> 370.66
 So don't look at me without my permission.

21
371.66 --> 372.66
 It's obvious.

22
470.10 --> 472.10
 Why are you staring at me?

23
472.10 --> 479.28
 I can't help it.

24
479.28 --> 480.28
 You're scary.

25
480.28 --> 486.83
 I can't calm down because it's not my house.

26
487.83 --> 488.83
 It's fine.

27
490.83 --> 492.83
 You know I'm scary.

28
499.88 --> 500.88
 Don't look at me.

29
502.88 --> 503.88
 I'm going to sleep.

30
504.88 --> 505.88
 Good night.

31
506.88 --> 535.16
 By the way, do you have a girlfriend?

32
538.88 --> 539.88
 I knew it.

33
539.88 --> 540.88
 No way.

34
540.88 --> 551.13
 Never mind.

35
551.13 --> 553.13
 You don't want to be with me.

36
553.13 --> 567.41
 By the way, I've noticed something.

37
572.22 --> 573.22
 Are you standing up?

38
576.66 --> 577.66
 Why?

39
582.27 --> 583.27
 Oh my gosh.

40
584.27 --> 585.27
 Let me see.

41
587.78 --> 588.78
 You're really standing up.

42
592.54 --> 593.54
 Why?

43
601.29 --> 602.29
 It's fine.

44
605.11 --> 606.11
 You don't need to lose weight.

45
613.99 --> 617.99
 I'm not interested in you.

46
619.99 --> 623.99
 I don't want to touch you at all.

47
629.57 --> 631.57
 I can't sleep.

48
637.08 --> 640.52
 I feel dizzy.

49
644.05 --> 647.05
 I don't mean you.

50
647.05 --> 651.05
 But I feel dizzy because of you.

51
652.05 --> 656.06
 I don't want to lose weight.

52
657.06 --> 664.57
 Lend me your bed until my dizziness is gone.

53
666.57 --> 667.57
 Okay?

54
668.57 --> 670.57
 You don't hate it, do you?

55
671.57 --> 681.59
 It's your fault that I showed you a strange video.

56
684.61 --> 685.61
 Take responsibility.

57
701.74 --> 705.74
 You wanted to do that.

58
710.68 --> 711.68
 Help me.

59
712.68 --> 720.88
 You're getting bigger.

60
730.66 --> 732.66
 Why are you standing up?

61
738.30 --> 739.30
 I'm surprised.

62
750.70 --> 751.70
 You can't sleep, can you?

63
753.70 --> 754.70
 You're getting hot, aren't you?

64
764.13 --> 765.13
 It's fine.

65
765.13 --> 766.13
 Why do you hate it?

66
767.13 --> 768.13
 Are you embarrassed?

67
770.13 --> 772.13
 I don't think so.

68
785.04 --> 787.04
 I've seen you when you were a kid.

69
790.42 --> 793.42
 You were bigger than I thought.

70
799.57 --> 800.57
 You've grown up.

71
813.63 --> 815.63
 It's very hot here.

72
841.56 --> 843.56
 Touch me.

73
853.42 --> 854.42
 You wanted to touch me, didn't you?

74
856.42 --> 857.42
 You're like this.

75
869.40 --> 871.40
 Why are you hesitating?

76
872.40 --> 880.45
 You don't have to be tough.

77
881.45 --> 882.45
 Touch me.

78
897.05 --> 899.05
 How do you feel?

79
926.13 --> 927.13
 Is it hard to touch?

80
929.13 --> 930.13
 I can't help it.

81
961.30 --> 964.30
 You've never touched me, have you?

82
965.30 --> 966.30
 You're not a virgin.

83
967.30 --> 980.09
 You're older than me.

84
981.09 --> 982.09
 Show me your good points.

85
1014.24 --> 1016.24
 Isn't it easier to touch now?

86
1046.78 --> 1048.78
 You know how to feel, don't you?

87
1051.09 --> 1052.09
 Touch me.

88
1052.09 --> 1080.42
 It's harder than before.

89
1098.80 --> 1099.80
 You're noisy.

90
1099.80 --> 1100.80
 Are you okay with me?

91
1114.18 --> 1115.18
 I'll take it off.

92
1135.74 --> 1144.06
 I'm going to get on top of you.

93
1144.06 --> 1145.06
 I'll touch you, too.

94
1152.18 --> 1153.18
 I like your nipples.

95
1164.90 --> 1167.90
 Men's nipples feel good, too.

96
1172.23 --> 1173.23
 Is that so?

97
1185.66 --> 1200.64
 Does it feel good?

98
1200.64 --> 1202.64
 Are you happy to do this?

99
1203.64 --> 1225.41
 You're a virgin.

100
1231.56 --> 1235.56
 You're always thinking about that, aren't you?

101
1242.61 --> 1243.61
 What's that face?

102
1249.67 --> 1250.67
 I see.

103
1251.67 --> 1252.67
 You want me to kiss you, don't you?

104
1258.44 --> 1259.44
 I can't help it.

105
1287.93 --> 1289.93
 I don't like you.

106
1290.93 --> 1291.93
 Don't get me wrong.

107
1316.19 --> 1317.19
 I'm getting hot.

108
1339.66 --> 1342.66
 I'm getting hot, too.

109
1343.66 --> 1347.36
 Take responsibility and do something.

110
1351.06 --> 1354.06
 You've been watching me all this time, haven't you?

111
1361.04 --> 1364.54
 Take responsibility.

112
1386.26 --> 1387.26
 Are you sleepy?

113
1393.61 --> 1395.61
 I told you I was sleepy.

114
1401.70 --> 1403.70
 We're all the same.

115
1410.04 --> 1412.04
 You don't have to say anything like that.

116
1413.04 --> 1468.92
 Touch me.

117
1468.92 --> 1470.92
 You're standing up, too.

118
1481.94 --> 1483.94
 You're doing this.

119
1491.50 --> 1492.50
 I hate you.

120
1493.50 --> 1504.94
 You're still growing up.

121
1526.52 --> 1530.52
 You've grown up a lot.

122
1532.83 --> 1533.83
 You're like an adult.

123
1539.90 --> 1540.90
 I like you, too.

124
1573.94 --> 1575.94
 You're excited, too.

125
1582.86 --> 1583.86
 I'm sorry.

126
1584.86 --> 1595.40
 I didn't tell you to take it off.

127
1600.99 --> 1601.99
 Hey.

128
1602.99 --> 1604.99
 Your fingers are in there.

129
1617.42 --> 1625.85
 I'm used to touching you.

130
1642.30 --> 1644.30
 You're moving like that.

131
1647.30 --> 1651.13
 Does it feel good?

132
1654.91 --> 1655.91
 I see.

133
1681.55 --> 1683.55
 I didn't mean to do it.

134
1684.55 --> 1691.55
 But if you want to do it, I'll do it for you.

135
1704.30 --> 1705.30
 What?

136
1706.30 --> 1707.30
 You know that, don't you?

137
1713.78 --> 1714.78
 Are you going to stop?

138
1719.52 --> 1720.52
 Can I?

139
1721.52 --> 1722.52
 Can I really do it?

140
1722.52 --> 1753.95
 What's with that face?

141
1760.98 --> 1785.94
 I can't help it.

142
1786.94 --> 1788.94
 I'm just doing it for you.

143
1802.58 --> 1830.74
 I want to do it for you, too.

144
1831.74 --> 1843.90
 You can't do this without her, can you?

145
1844.90 --> 1849.01
 You watched the movie, didn't you?

146
1851.01 --> 1861.21
 I'm doing it for you because I feel sorry for you.

147
1896.94 --> 1899.94
 You're bigger than me.

148
1904.60 --> 1937.93
 That's what you look like.

149
2066.30 --> 2068.30
 I can't stop it.

150
2070.99 --> 2071.99
 It's your fault.

151
2078.34 --> 2079.34
 Take responsibility.

152
2080.34 --> 2081.34
 Not just me.

153
2082.34 --> 2084.34
 You're shaking, too.

154
2106.87 --> 2120.06
 Yes.

155
2135.42 --> 2136.42
 Follow me from behind.

156
2138.42 --> 2139.42
 You've done it before, haven't you?

157
2144.34 --> 2146.34
 I've done it for you so far.

158
2147.34 --> 2150.71
 Please listen to my last wish.

159
2241.52 --> 2259.51
 What?

160
2261.51 --> 2262.51
 Do you want to do it, too?

161
2305.67 --> 2306.67
 Wait.

162
2354.40 --> 2359.72
 I can't do it.

163
2516.53 --> 2521.48
 It felt really good, didn't it?

164
2523.48 --> 2528.48
 I've always liked you.

165
2529.48 --> 2533.26
 I'm sorry.

166
2534.26 --> 2537.26
 I've been cold to you until now.

167
2538.26 --> 2539.26
 I've said a lot of things.

168
2546.50 --> 2548.50
 But I'm happy to be like this.

169
2549.50 --> 2557.22
 This is definitely a secret.

170
2558.22 --> 2563.10
 Good night.

171
2580.19 --> 2582.19
 I don't understand the class at all.

172
2583.19 --> 2584.19
 I don't understand it, either.

173
2585.19 --> 2586.19
 I don't want to do the final test.

174
2587.19 --> 2589.19
 Let's play together.

175
2590.19 --> 2591.19
 Let's play soccer.

176
2593.19 --> 2599.02
 Hey.

177
2600.02 --> 2603.02
 Do you have any friends?

178
2609.45 --> 2610.45
 I want to talk to you.

179
2611.45 --> 2612.45
 Come here.

180
2616.94 --> 2618.94
 I said come here.

181
2619.94 --> 2633.10
 No one will come here.

182
2634.10 --> 2637.38
 Hey.

183
2638.38 --> 2640.38
 You didn't tell anyone about yesterday, did you?

184
2641.38 --> 2644.71
 Really?

185
2645.71 --> 2647.71
 You don't have a boyfriend, do you?

186
2652.02 --> 2653.02
 But...

187
2654.02 --> 2656.02
 If you find out, I'll be in trouble.

188
2657.02 --> 2659.02
 I'll be in trouble.

189
2661.34 --> 2662.34
 Just in case...

190
2666.74 --> 2669.74
 I've been thinking about something good.

191
2678.62 --> 2682.62
 I have to keep my mouth shut.

192
2689.55 --> 2691.55
 I said just in case.

193
2699.94 --> 2701.94
 I'll be in trouble if I find out.

194
2702.94 --> 2712.14
 I don't know why you don't tell me.

195
2734.86 --> 2736.86
 You don't hate me at all, do you?

196
2737.86 --> 2742.90
 What are you talking about?

197
2757.03 --> 2758.03
 Shut up.

198
2760.03 --> 2763.03
 If you make a lot of noise, someone will come.

199
2766.50 --> 2767.50
 I have to keep my mouth shut.

200
2789.52 --> 2792.52
 I'm worried about you.

201
2796.92 --> 2815.68
 Hey.

202
2816.68 --> 2819.68
 How long have you been standing like this?

203
2827.94 --> 2828.94
 You're a pervert.

204
2840.47 --> 2841.47
 Do you feel good?

205
2862.77 --> 2863.77
 This feels good, too.

206
2864.77 --> 2871.43
 That's great.

207
2872.43 --> 2873.43
 You're always standing still.

208
2874.43 --> 2915.89
 You like this, don't you?

209
2918.33 --> 2920.33
 It's easy to understand.

210
2934.33 --> 2936.33
 What? Are you excited to see my butt?

211
2937.33 --> 2945.50
 You can be more excited.

212
2945.50 --> 2946.50
 Be excited.

213
2966.10 --> 2968.10
 I'm clumsy.

214
2970.10 --> 2981.82
 How do you feel?

215
2982.82 --> 2983.82
 You're always standing still.

216
2999.26 --> 3001.26
 You've been staring at my butt.

217
3005.10 --> 3010.10
 If you like my butt so much, I'll rub it for you.

218
3011.10 --> 3012.10
 Come here.

219
3027.56 --> 3028.56
 You like my butt, don't you?

220
3028.56 --> 3029.56
 You like my butt, don't you?

221
3033.92 --> 3034.92
 That's good.

222
3046.06 --> 3048.06
 Have you ever done something like this?

223
3052.76 --> 3053.76
 You haven't?

224
3054.76 --> 3056.76
 Then, it's my first time.

225
3088.45 --> 3089.45
 That's good.

226
3090.45 --> 3091.45
 Rub it as much as you like.

227
3145.31 --> 3146.31
 That's great.

228
3166.93 --> 3171.03
 You've got a lot.

229
3171.03 --> 3172.03
 You've got a lot.

230
3175.03 --> 3179.03
 This is a secret between us.

231
3226.10 --> 3252.48
 What?

232
3253.48 --> 3255.48
 You were afraid to take a bath alone.

233
3260.22 --> 3262.22
 It's because you're embarrassed.

234
3263.22 --> 3265.22
 Don't stare at me.

235
3269.97 --> 3273.97
 I told you I was afraid to take a bath alone.

236
3274.97 --> 3275.97
 You really don't understand.

237
3276.97 --> 3278.97
 Just take it off.

238
3279.97 --> 3283.18
 It feels good, doesn't it?

239
3287.19 --> 3288.19
 It feels good.

240
3290.19 --> 3291.19
 Look at this.

241
3293.19 --> 3294.19
 It's so transparent.

242
3296.19 --> 3297.19
 Isn't it great?

243
3309.45 --> 3311.45
 What have you been holding back?

244
3315.49 --> 3316.49
 You've been holding it back all the time.

245
3320.34 --> 3321.34
 I can see it.

246
3322.34 --> 3328.80
 Are you standing up?

247
3333.54 --> 3335.54
 What's that look?

248
3338.54 --> 3340.54
 Do you like tap water?

249
3342.54 --> 3343.54
 It's perfect for you.

250
3354.82 --> 3356.82
 I'll give you a bath with tap water.

251
3413.93 --> 3433.26
 How do you feel?

252
3438.39 --> 3439.39
 Because you took a bath with me.

253
3459.82 --> 3460.82
 You like water so much.

254
3462.82 --> 3464.82
 You're wearing this today.

255
3467.64 --> 3468.64
 I'm just wearing it because I'm embarrassed.

256
3469.64 --> 3494.61
 I've been waiting for this.

257
3514.18 --> 3516.18
 You like this, don't you?

258
3517.18 --> 3536.77
 I've been waiting for this.

259
3537.77 --> 3563.89
 I've been getting dizzy.

260
3565.89 --> 3566.89
 Touch mine.

261
3568.89 --> 3571.33
 It's nice, isn't it?

262
3571.33 --> 3620.62
 Do you like it?

263
3621.62 --> 3622.62
 I'll touch you from behind.

264
3634.15 --> 3635.15
 Touch me.

265
3646.63 --> 3648.63
 You can touch me directly.

266
3652.99 --> 3653.99
 You want to touch me, don't you?

267
3710.73 --> 3711.73
 Put your fingers in it.

268
3741.29 --> 3742.29
 You can touch me more.

269
3743.29 --> 3752.62
 I'll do it harder.

270
3893.33 --> 3894.33
 Next, I'll do it from behind.

271
4002.73 --> 4003.73
 I'll give you a bath.

272
4048.06 --> 4049.06
 I'll give you a bath.

273
4051.06 --> 4052.06
 I'll continue outside.

274
4080.86 --> 4081.86
 Can you see me?

275
4087.82 --> 4088.82
 I feel good.

276
4100.76 --> 4101.76
 I feel good.

277
4118.65 --> 4127.62
 I feel good.

278
4143.67 --> 4144.67
 I'm sweating.

279
4146.67 --> 4147.67
 I'm sweating a lot.

280
4153.07 --> 4155.51
 More.

281
4175.87 --> 4180.49
 I'm sweating a lot.

282
4224.76 --> 4225.76
 Can you see me?

283
4228.26 --> 4229.26
 I feel good.

284
4259.85 --> 4260.85
 You like my swimsuit, don't you?

285
4262.85 --> 4263.85
 I like it.

286
4330.93 --> 4357.30
 It's cold.

287
4388.80 --> 4389.80
 I feel good.

288
4413.95 --> 4414.95
 I feel good.

289
4432.82 --> 4433.82
 I'm sweating a lot.

290
4439.14 --> 4471.08
 Can you see me?

291
4471.08 --> 4472.08
 I'm sweating a lot.

292
4478.68 --> 4479.68
 I'm sweating a lot.

293
4508.62 --> 4512.62
 Let's take a bath together again tomorrow.

294
4514.62 --> 4515.62
 Brother.

295
4531.50 --> 4534.50
 You're so kind.

296
4539.35 --> 4546.66
 I love you.

297
4546.66 --> 4552.66
 When I grow up, I'll marry someone like you.

298
4557.16 --> 4558.16
 Are you happy?

299
4561.16 --> 4567.16
 By the way, you felt good today, didn't you?

300
4569.16 --> 4572.16
 I was very excited.

301
4573.16 --> 4582.90
 Your troubled face was very cute.

302
4683.28 --> 4684.28
 You're good at this.

303
4687.28 --> 4688.28
 I didn't learn it.

304
4695.23 --> 4696.23
 I didn't learn it.

305
4698.23 --> 4699.23
 I think I'm good at it.

306
4708.23 --> 4709.23
 I haven't learned it yet.

307
4739.23 --> 4741.23
 Do you understand?

308
4741.23 --> 4743.23
 Go around.

309
4743.23 --> 4748.98
 Go around.

310
4748.98 --> 4750.98
 Minus 18 degrees.

311
4750.98 --> 4753.98
 It's going to go to 0 here.

312
4753.98 --> 4755.98
 I can't go here.

313
4755.98 --> 4757.98
 It's going to go to x.

314
4757.98 --> 4760.98
 Will this be in the next test?

315
4760.98 --> 4762.98
 It will.

316
4762.98 --> 4764.98
 It's important.

317
4764.98 --> 4768.98
 It's also in the UG.

318
4768.98 --> 4771.98
 I don't know if it will be in the next test.

319
4771.98 --> 4776.06
 Is it in the next test?

320
4776.06 --> 4778.06
 It's in the next test.

321
4790.06 --> 4792.06
 It's very flat.

322
4796.06 --> 4798.06
 I don't know.

323
4804.06 --> 4811.06
 I don't use this formula, but it's important to use your head.

324
4813.06 --> 4815.06
 You can calculate it.

325
4815.06 --> 4818.06
 It's the power to think about it.

326
4818.06 --> 4820.06
 Next.

327
4820.06 --> 4823.06
 24x14-81.

328
4823.06 --> 4825.06
 Expand it.

329
4825.06 --> 4834.83
 Expand?

330
4875.70 --> 4877.70
 Does it come out here?

331
4877.70 --> 4879.70
 It's a little different.

332
4879.70 --> 4884.70
 If you remember this, you'll get 100 points for the next test.

333
4888.70 --> 4890.70
 How many points should I get?

334
4890.70 --> 4897.12
 You got it in the end.

335
4897.12 --> 4899.12
 You were excited.

336
4899.12 --> 4907.21
 This is fun.

337
4988.45 --> 4994.66
 This is the last day of my life.

338
4994.66 --> 4996.66
 It's early.

339
4996.66 --> 5002.46
 You're back.

340
5002.46 --> 5006.46
 I'm sorry I can't live with you.

341
5006.46 --> 5008.46
 I'm getting better.

342
5012.99 --> 5014.99
 What?

343
5014.99 --> 5016.99
 Are you lonely?

344
5016.99 --> 5025.42
 I'll draw it on your face.

345
5025.42 --> 5028.42
 It's really easy to understand.

346
5031.42 --> 5033.42
 I can't help it.

347
5033.42 --> 5038.86
 I'll do it for you at the end.

348
5098.90 --> 5110.47
 You're so lonely.

349
5110.47 --> 5113.47
 We can't live together from tomorrow.

350
5113.47 --> 5122.97
 I can't help it.

351
5122.97 --> 5137.26
 I know how you feel.

352
5180.42 --> 5211.44
 You're really surprised.

353
5211.44 --> 5218.59
 You're not embarrassed.

354
5235.32 --> 5279.08
 What's wrong?

355
5279.08 --> 5288.54
 Hey.

356
5288.54 --> 5290.54
 Touch me.

357
5290.54 --> 5323.67
 Can I touch you from your clothes?

358
5323.67 --> 5344.74
 I can't help it.

359
5357.62 --> 5372.46
 Don't touch me.

360
5372.46 --> 5377.22
 Touch me directly.

361
5377.22 --> 5382.83
 You let me take it off.

362
5461.26 --> 5465.26
 You know how I feel.

363
5480.01 --> 5484.01
 Touch me where I feel good.

364
5496.43 --> 5507.08
 You like it, don't you?

365
5520.67 --> 5522.67
 Let me take it off.

366
5522.67 --> 5550.54
 You're still clumsy.

367
5610.18 --> 5628.73
 What's wrong?

368
5628.73 --> 5630.73
 You're used to it, aren't you?

369
5630.73 --> 5678.34
 Don't look at me so closely.

370
5678.34 --> 5680.34
 What's wrong?

371
5699.86 --> 5703.50
 Touch me.

372
5705.50 --> 5713.86
 I can't help it.

373
5727.39 --> 5729.39
 I can't help it.

374
5745.59 --> 5748.59
 You touched me too hard.

375
5775.50 --> 5779.50
 You touched me so hard.

376
5783.54 --> 5788.06
 Look at me.

377
5789.06 --> 5795.81
 It's all your fault.

378
5795.81 --> 5803.34
 What should I do?

379
5854.02 --> 5856.02
 I love you.

380
5871.36 --> 5873.36
 I love you.

381
5877.36 --> 5879.36
 I love you.

382
5918.72 --> 5921.72
 I want to lick you again.

383
5933.19 --> 5959.61
 Lick me.

384
5973.41 --> 6009.68
 I'm getting bigger.

385
6009.68 --> 6033.79
 Can you see me?

386
6048.93 --> 6051.93
 I'm getting bigger.

387
6063.26 --> 6069.04
 You want to lick me, don't you?

388
6069.04 --> 6071.04
 It's the last day.

389
6071.04 --> 6098.14
 You can lick me.

390
6103.90 --> 6110.92
 Look at me.

391
6112.92 --> 6118.79
 Do you feel good?

392
6124.87 --> 6130.81
 Do you feel good?

393
6131.81 --> 6133.81
 I feel good.

394
6148.54 --> 6171.22
 I didn't say anything.

395
6173.92 --> 6175.92
 I don't feel good.

396
6177.92 --> 6179.92
 Why do you ask me that?

397
6190.27 --> 6194.16
 Look at me.

398
6195.16 --> 6211.57
 I didn't say anything.

399
6229.14 --> 6231.14
 You're getting bigger.

400
6236.90 --> 6239.90
 Do you feel good?

401
6239.90 --> 6244.36
 Do you feel good?

402
6252.30 --> 6256.30
 You're really good.

403
6276.80 --> 6281.33
 Touch me.

404
6295.77 --> 6297.77
 Do you feel good?

405
6331.05 --> 6333.05
 I didn't say anything.

406
6409.14 --> 6412.14
 You're getting bigger.

407
6474.62 --> 6476.62
 You're getting bigger.

408
6490.71 --> 6496.71
 I love you as much as I love you.

409
6497.71 --> 6499.71
 I love you.

410
6499.71 --> 6505.90
 I love you.

411
6541.52 --> 6562.43
 You're getting bigger.

412
6593.55 --> 6595.55
 You're getting bigger.

413
6630.26 --> 6632.26
 You're amazing.

414
6662.86 --> 6664.86
 You're amazing.

415
6679.84 --> 6684.37
 You're amazing.

416
6697.30 --> 6699.30
 I love you.

417
6800.43 --> 6802.43
 You're amazing.

418
6823.22 --> 6825.22
 I love you as much as I love you.

419
6832.90 --> 6837.81
 I love you.

420
6840.81 --> 6850.01
 I love you.

421
6850.01 --> 6852.01
 I love you.

422
6866.07 --> 6868.07
 I don't want to do anything at the end.

423
6945.88 --> 6947.88
 Are you going to go?

424
6951.88 --> 6955.88
 You can go out wherever you want.

425
6959.88 --> 6980.25
 You can go out wherever you want.

426
7054.76 --> 7060.76
 I'm sorry if I came to see you again.

427
7066.84 --> 7074.22
 I've always wanted to be with you since I was a kid.

428
7076.22 --> 7078.22
 I'm sorry.
