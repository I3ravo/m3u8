1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:08,140
It was delicious, wasn't it?

2
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:09,976
Yes, it was really delicious.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,900
Can I join you? Yes, you can.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,060
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,240
Really? I joined you the other day, too.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,720
It's OK.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,380
By the way, do you have time after this?

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,071
Yes, if I make it in
time for the last train.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,960
Oh, then let's go to my favorite bar.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:27,980
Bar?

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,680
Yes.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I've never been there.

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,480
Really?

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:30,960
Yes.

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,540
Let's go.

16
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:31,760
Let's go.

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
This way.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,540
The entrance is very suspicious.

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,020
No, it's normal.

20
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
Is it a bar? It's not a bar.

21
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340


22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,240
I got a call from a bar.

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,100
It was crowded.

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,440
So I changed my mind.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I see.

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,860
Let's go in.

27
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,040
It's not suspicious.

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,540
It's like a grocery store.

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,290
LOL

30
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,910
What's wrong with you?

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,450
Are you drunk?

32
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,230
Are you OK?

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,510
I'm looking forward to it.

34
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,350
Good job.

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,350
Good job.

36
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,351
Are you drunk?

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,090
Are you drunk? I was drunk.

38
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:26,790


39
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,110
Oh, really?

40
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,410
Oh, really?

41
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,730
Oh, really?

42
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,330
You can drink there.

43
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,770
You can drink there.

44
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:32,930
What's that? We're friends.

45
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,790


46
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,110
Let's drink together.

47
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,450
It's fun to drink together, isn't it?

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,530
Are you guys drinking?

49
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,370
Of course we are.

50
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,510
Isn't it not enough?

51
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,310
Can I drink all of it?

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,090
Cheers!

53
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,730
Do you want to drink something?

54
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,910
What do you want to drink?

55
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,670
Do you want to drink
URAHAI? I'll bring it.

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,770


57
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,230
Where did you find this?

58
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,610
Cheers!

59
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,670
Cheers!

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,670
You guys are nervous.

61
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,650
You guys are nervous.

62
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,170
I'll make you relax with a funny gag.

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,410
3,2,1

64
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:37,411
I did it!

65
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,810
I did it!

66
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,270
You're laughing.

67
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,640
You're not drinking enough.

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Why?

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,600
Why?

70
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:51,700
Why?

71
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,000
Why?

72
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,001
You are drinking a lot.

73
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,780
You are always looking at me.

74
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
What do you mean?

75
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,980
You are always looking at me.

76
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,860
You are not good enough.

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Stop it.

78
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,920
I think I drank a lot.

79
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,060
You are like a takoyaki.

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
It will get cold.

81
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,140
I'm going to go.

82
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:13,381
I have to go to the last train.

83
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,740
You have to go to the last train?

84
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Really?

85
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,580
I'm going to the last train.

86
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,100
I see.

87
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,760
Let's drink a lot at the end.

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,980
I'm pretty drunk today.

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Let's have a drink.

90
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
There is a very delicious drink.

91
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
I'll make it.

92
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,540
Wait a minute.

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,240
Let's have a drink.

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,220
A very delicious drink?

95
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,780
Are you going to make
that drink? Let's do it.

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,560
It's a special drink.

97
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's do it.

98
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,080
Wait a minute.

99
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,280
Welcome.

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
It's very delicious.

101
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,620
What's wrong with you?

102
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,920
It's very delicious.

103
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,360
It's very delicious.

104
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
He is good at it.

105
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,700
His drinking skill is really good.

106
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Really.

107
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,280
He is good at it.

108
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,380
He is good at it too.

109
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,381
He is good at it.

110
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,580
What does it mean?

111
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,950
Why do you throw it away?

112
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,970
Why do you throw it away?

113
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,970
Why do you throw
it away? He is scary.

114
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,051
What's wrong with you today?

115
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,570
I'm really looking forward to it.

116
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,490
Thank you for waiting.

117
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,270
Look at the color.

118
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,710
Isn't the color cute?

119
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,590
This is the usual one.

120
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,910
This is a gimmick.

121
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,530
This is a really good
one made by Shun, who likes sake.

122
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,370
I was thinking of developing a product.

123
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,590
Let's have a drink to celebrate the first
anniversary of Chiharu-chan's debut.

124
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,890
To meet Chiharu-chan,

125
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,170
Cheers!

126
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,350
Chiharu, drink it all.

127
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:14,930
Drink it all!

128
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,118
At first, it might be
a strong attack, but once

129
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,030
you get used to it,
you'll be able to drink it.

130
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,270
Is the camera okay over there?
Is it rolling?

131
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,030
Yeah, it's rolling perfectly.

132
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,430
Okay.

133
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,570
I've already drunk too much.

134
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,390
It's not okay.

135
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,770
You look like you're not satisfied.

136
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,490
You are so cute.

137
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,090
What's wrong? Did you get drunk?

138
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,230
You got drunk, didn't you?

139
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,931
Are you okay? Are you conscious?

140
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,730
I want to go home.

141
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,130
Do you want to go home?

142
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,970
Can you see it?

143
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,670
Do you want to go home?

144
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,170
Why?

145
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,690
Welcome home!

146
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,250
Why?

147
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,790
Why is there a cat here?

148
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,830
What's wrong?

149
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,590
Chaco, why?

150
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,270
Why?

151
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,230
There is a cat here, too.

152
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:33,910
Here, too.

153
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,290
Here is a new cat.

154
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,250
Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:41,170
It's a new cat.

156
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,990
Yes.

157
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:51,490
Let's taste it properly
and see if you can open your mouth.

158
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,520
Pass, pass, pass.

159
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
She is eating very well.

160
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,721
She is still hungry.

161
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
She is eating well.

162
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,340
She is eating well.

163
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,980
She is eating very well.

164
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
She is eating very well.

165
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,500
She is moving her tongue.

166
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,860
Is she moving?

167
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,480
Yes.

168
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,860
She is licking her tongue.

169
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,100
She is a bitch.

170
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,360
Is she a bitch? She is a bitch.

171
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,800


172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Is she so cute?

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Is she a bitch?

174
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,280
Did she do it
on purpose? Good girl.

175
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
This way.

176
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,840
No, no, no.

177
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,620
No, it's not like that.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,040
Are you going to take a bath?

179
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:33,110
It feels really good.

180
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:46,380
I'm going to go to the back of the room.

181
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,060
Did you want to go home by last train?
Or did you want to go to the lab with me?

182
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,196
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

183
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,460
Which one do you want to go to?

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,700
I think everyone is looking forward to it.

185
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,500
I think so, too.

186
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,060
It's better to play with everyone.

187
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,060
It may not be a play.

188
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
I think so, too.

189
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,080
Let's drink it carefully to the end.

190
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,980
Slowly Oh, it feels good.

191
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm going to put a towel on his neck.

192
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
He is in pain.

193
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,240
He is in pain.

194
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
He is in pain.

195
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
He is in pain.

196
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,140
Open your mouth You
are about to throw up

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,520
Open your mouth and move

198
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:22,060
Now, let's go to the
back Do you feel good?

199
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,610
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

200
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:36,611
You're so wet.

201
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,330
Come here.

202
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,330
Come here.

203
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,140
You're so rough.

204
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:01,780
You are eating everything.

205
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,280
Can I sit here?

206
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,820
You can sit here.

207
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,700
Let's make you grown up.

208
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,680
Now Hiragao is getting ugly.

209
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
What a waste.

210
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,000
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

211
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm going to put him in the box.

212
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,990
Wow, you are so cute.

213
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:03,991
Good boy.

214
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,910
Here, here.

215
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,990
Good boy.

216
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,650
Is it a execution ground?

217
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,730
You are gonna puke.

218
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
Good boy.

219
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910
Good boy.

220
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,770
You can't run away, can you?

221
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,390
It doesn't matter if
you don't die, does it? Let's have fun.

222
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,590


223
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,630
How are you?

224
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,631
How are you?

225
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,430
Pon-kichi, this way.

226
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,990
Pon-kichi, this way.

227
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,210
Let me take your tongue out.

228
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,950
You are a good boy, Pon-kichi.

229
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,290
You are a good boy.

230
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,430
Open your mouth.

231
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,270
Do you eat this? Yes, I do.

232
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,030


233
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,810
Do you eat this?

234
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,950
Open your mouth.

235
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,750
Give me a lot of food.

236
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,110
Don't spill it.

237
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,450
You can't.

238
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,770
Yummy.

239
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Open your mouth.

240
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,910
I'm going to give you a treat.

241
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:47,630
Don't spit it out.
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

242
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,150
You have a bad breath, so you have
to be careful.

243
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,750
Open your eyes.

244
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,810
You are a good boy.

245
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,580
You are too nervous.

246
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,560
Go, go.

247
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,020
Love-chan, do you think you can go?

248
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,920
You did it, you did it.

249
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,220
Is it OK? I'll hold you.

250
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,920


251
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,260
You'll feel good.

252
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,020
Go, go, go.

253
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Look.

254
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,180
Look, you can go further.

255
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Look.

256
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Oh, no.

257
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
You have a sore throat.

258
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,040
I will lift your chin.

259
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,880
And this side.

260
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,980
It was so good.

261
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
You are getting better.

262
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,650
Please put your head down.

263
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,280
Head?

264
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,680
Please put your head down.

265
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,220
Please open your mouth.

266
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Please open your mouth.

267
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes, yes.

268
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,170
You are breathing well.

269
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,100
How do you feel?

270
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,240
How do you feel? Tell me.

271
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,510


272
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,600
I don't know if you are drunk or not.

273
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,960
Oh, you feel good.

274
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,740
You are drinking a lot.

275
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,960
Oh, you feel good.

276
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,320
Don't let go.

277
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm going to let you out of the cage.

278
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,700
I'm going to let you go.

279
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:45,840
Let go of me.

280
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:18,330
You've got so much.

281
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,930
I've put out a lot.

282
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,290
You've put out a lot.

283
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,850
Awesome.

284
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,410
Awesome.

285
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,730
Awesome.

286
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,310
Awesome.

287
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,590
Cheers.

288
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,210
Cheers.

289
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,750
Cheers.

290
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,490
It seems like Jiharu can't do it.

291
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Jiharu, let's drink.

292
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,620
It's hot, isn't it?

293
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
It's hot, isn't it? It's hot.

294
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440


295
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,920
Are you OK?

296
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm taking it off for you.

297
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,900
Is this a string? I'm sorry.

298
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm sorry.

299
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
It's okay.

300
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,920


301
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,020
I'm going to give you a drink.

302
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,580
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
It's okay.

304
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:36,680
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,540
I like this.

309
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
You know this.

310
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
You're so dirty, you son of a bitch!

311
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,580
Don't get cocky!

312
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,440
You're so dirty.

313
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
I'm going to go wash up.

314
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,450
You're all sweaty.

315
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,270
We have to drink again.

316
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,650
Yeah, we have to.

317
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,010
Open your mouth.

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,850
We have to reset it.

319
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,110
I'm going to give you a massage.

320
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,360
Do you feel good
now? Let's have fun.

321
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,600


322
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:02,360
You don't want to take it off, do you?

323
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
It's so much fun.

324
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm going to throw it away.

325
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,340
This one?

326
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm going to throw it away.

327
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
It's hot, isn't it?

328
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,140
Your buttocks are big.

329
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,900
Big buttocks.

330
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Your buttocks are erotic.

331
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,760
Your buttocks are erotic.

332
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,020
I'll massage your buttocks.

333
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll massage your buttocks.

334
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,760
What's the matter?

335
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,160
It's been a month.

336
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,250
Give me your tongue.

337
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,610
I'll kiss you.

338
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,190
I'll be popular.

339
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,670
I'm more popular than you.

340
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,050
It's more fun if we do
it together, isn't it?

341
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,450
Do you feel good?

342
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,700
Do you want me to take your boobs off?

343
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,950
What do you mean by that?

344
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,870
I mean the back of your head.

345
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,210
What are you talking about?

346
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,630
Cheers!

347
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:06,690
Cheers!

348
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,810
You have a lot of pus.

349
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,670
What's wrong?

350
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,030
You have a lot of pus.

351
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,230
Cheers!

352
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,830
You have a lot of pus.

You have a lot of pus.

354
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,150
You have a lot of pus.

355
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,191
You are getting sensitive.

356
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,390
Do you feel good?

357
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,990
Do you like it?

358
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,610
You're getting stronger.

359
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
You're becoming stiff.

360
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,910
Open your mouth.

361
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:46,490
I'm sure you'll be fine.

362
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,870
Yeah, I'm sure.

363
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,670
I'm sure.

364
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:50,671
You're gonna be fine.

365
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,490
Hold her tight.

366
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,850
Is it comfortable?

367
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,010
It's uncomfortable.

368
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,410
It's comfortable, isn't it?

369
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,730
I want to go home.

370
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,270
I don't think so.

371
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,530
This is our house.
You can stay here whenever you want.

372
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
We won't let you go out.

373
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
We won't let you go out.

374
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,410
We won't let you go out.

375
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,890
I don't have a guide.

376
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,590
I don't have a guide.

377
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,450
Listen to me in English.

378
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:44,451
It's dangerous.

379
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,550
Look at his butt.

380
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,750
He's going to the back.

381
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,850
He's looking this way.

382
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,230
Don't spit it out again.

383
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,750
It feels good, doesn't it?

384
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,530
Put your tongue out.

385
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,770
Put your tongue out more.

386
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,330
It feels good, doesn't it?

387
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,590
You are enjoying it, aren't you?

You have a good face.

390
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,990
You are grumbling.

391
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,730
You are doing your best.

Good.

399
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,430

00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,430
Hold her legs.

401
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,730

403
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,050
She is trying to spread
her legs by herself.

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
Be gentle.

519
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,430
Already?

520
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,990
What? You are fast.

521
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,130
Be gentle.

522
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,670
Good boy.

523
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,370


524
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,980
You can change the position.

525
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,360
When she got old, she was so scared
of people that she could hardly move.

526
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,840
She was scared of
people and couldn't go outside.

527
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,276
She was scared of
people and couldn't go outside.

528
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,480
She was so
scared that she couldn't go outside.

529
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:20,481
Look at me.

530
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,800
Look at my shoulder.

531
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,160
Look at me.

532
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:37,300
You can kiss me.

533
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,350
Be careful.

534
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,960
It's dangerous.

535
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Kiss me.

536
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,610
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

537
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,630
Are you OK?

538
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,030
I was surprised.

539
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,370
You were surprised? I'm sorry.

540
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,550
I'm sorry for everyone.

541
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,430
You were too drunk.

542
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,950
I didn't know you were so drunk.

543
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:13,951
What are you doing?

544
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,010
Nanao, why are you so shy?

545
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,050
You look so scared.

546
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,881
I can see your love-sabre.

547
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,350
Look at Nanao.

548
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,390
Show me.

549
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:53,960
Let's go, let's go.

550
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:03,040
Can you move up a little?

551
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,300
Move up? I'm tired.

552
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,580
Let me raise your shoulders.

553
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,760
Let's do it.

554
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,900
Ready, go.

555
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:17,800
Go up.

556
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Go.

557
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,910
Oh, you are shaking.

558
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,956
Your back
is shaking when you are in the bed.

559
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
Oh, my.

560
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,840
You are holding her.

561
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,220
Yes, I am.

562
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:32,221
Let her move.

563
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Up and down.

564
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,990
Oh, my.

565
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,140
Oh, my.

566
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,740
You are going to fall down.

567
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:40,741
Let's go.

568
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
I'm going up.

569
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,740
Get up, please.

570
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,600
Shizu-chan, you don't
want to go forward? She's groaning.

571
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480


572
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,730
Does she feel
good? She likes it.

573
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,031
I think it's about time.

574
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,630
It's dangerous.

575
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,570
Come here.

576
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,310
You must be tired.

577
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,940
You have a big waist.

578
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,440
It's time to go.

579
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,360
Take it off.

580
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,760
Slowly.

581
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,840
Give it to him slowly.

582
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
You want to put it in?

583
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:09,320
You're gonna take
it, aren't you? Yes, I am.

584
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:10,561
I'm gonna take it.

585
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,860
Give it back to him.

586
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,740
You always do something.

587
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,161
He has a lot of influence on him.

588
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,260
He is always like this.

589
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,740
He is always like this.

590
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,740
He is always like this.

591
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,900
He is always like this.

592
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:32,060
He is always like this.

593
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:32,080
He is always like this.

594
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:32,200
He is always like this.

595
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,201
He is always like this.

596
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,240
He is always like this.

597
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,740
He is always like this.

598
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:43,741
Wow, you are strong.

599
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Are you sad?

600
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
Open your mouth.

601
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,990
Wow, you are strong.

602
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:01,820
You have a strong mouth.

603
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,941
I'm going to close my mouth.

604
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,320
He closes his mouth a lot.

605
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,220
I'm surprised.

606
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,740
What's going on?

607
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,140
What's going on?

608
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
He was about to bite you.

609
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,220
You don't like it, do you?

610
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,890
Finally, you're going to win.

611
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:04,630
Get up.

612
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:07,370
Don't make me do it.

613
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,410
I'm not a tooth.

614
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:09,430
I'm not a tooth.

615
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,110
I'm not a tooth.

616
00:43:11,111 --> 00:43:12,010
I'm not a tooth.

617
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:14,230
Good night.

618
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,050
Isn't it great? Good night.

619
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,670
Good night.

620
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,430
He reacts so well.

621
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,011
He reacts so well when
I put him in the bag.

622
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,690
When I went to the back, I was surprised.

623
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,660
You wanted to have sex, didn't you?

624
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,300
It's better to have a lot of sex.

625
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
It's the best.

626
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,240
It's good, isn't it?

627
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:45,570
Mikan and Tamae are now at the same age.

628
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,590
Oh, it's disgusting.

629
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:55,530
Help me.

630
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,750
Thank you for helping me.

631
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,470
Thank you.

632
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,190
Oh, that's right.

633
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,650
You are amazing.

634
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,830
It's the right answer to enter this circle.

635
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,820
Are you having fun?

636
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
You are having fun.

637
00:45:52,010 --> 00:46:00,080
Do you want to kiss me so much?

638
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
You are so pure.

639
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,020
You are so pure.

640
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:11,840
It's good to hold hands like this.

641
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,200
It's good to hold hands like this.

642
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,700
You are so lonely.

643
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,780
You are so pure.

644
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,900
It's good to hold hands like this.

645
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:28,500
Give me a hand.

646
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,200
Give me a hand.

647
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:36,980
Give me a kiss.

648
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:44,460
Nao, what's wrong?
Give me a kiss.

649
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,940


650
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,700
You say, no, no, no!

651
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:58,440
Is it a matrimonial?

652
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,720
It's not a matrimonial.

653
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Show me a real kiss.

654
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:07,840
This is a real kiss.

655
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,280
I'll show you a real kiss.

656
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,300
I'll show you love.

657
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:22,360
This is how you kiss.

658
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,200
The cat reacted to the kiss on the lips.

659
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,820
Stop it!

660
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,040
It hurts, doesn't it? I'm sorry.

661
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,041


662
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,580
I'm trying to get the cat out of the cage.

663
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:30,280
I'm trying to get the cat out of the cage.

664
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,556
So you're going to
have sex for the rest of your life?

665
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,580
No!

666
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,860
Huh?

667
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:58,620
It's fine, right?

668
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,830
It's good, right?

669
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:11,010
What are you doing?

670
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:25,810
It's delicious, isn't it?

671
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:29,025
It's bitter, isn't it?

672
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,670
It's bitter, isn't it?

673
00:49:53,370 --> 00:50:15,440
It's bitter, isn't it?

674
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,760
Did you go to the vet?

675
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:28,260
Here is your medicine.

676
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:34,640
Let's go to the vet.

677
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,100
You drank the medicine.

678
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,350
You drank the medicine.

679
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,280
What are you
doing? Don't push me.

680
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,260
I don't like you.

681
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,780
Don't push me.

682
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:19,590
I'll put you on my back.

683
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,330
Don't help me.

684
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,550
I hope they get along well.

685
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,860
She is so cute.

686
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:30,220
She is so cute.

687
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,900
She is so cute.

688
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,480
She is so cute.

689
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,700
She is so cute.

690
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,400
It was really comfortable.

691
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:30,110
What is it?

692
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,590
I have no vocabulary.

693
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,950
It's the best to do it in Sour.

694
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,030
It's really the best.

695
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,430
That's right.

696
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,250
Don't say it.

697
00:53:41,205 --> 00:53:44,350
I'm going to take a picture.

698
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:45,830
Like always.

699
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,530
Let's take a picture.

700
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:47,270
I'm going to take a picture.

701
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:48,050
Let's take a picture.

702
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,090
Please take a picture.

703
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,650
This is a commemorative photo.

704
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,770
Let's make a peace sign.

705
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,630
Put your index finger
and middle finger like this.

706
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,970
Smile.

707
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,130
I have to smile.

708
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,690
Smile.

709
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:08,830
Peace.

710
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,390
Young, young.

711
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:11,990
Young.

712
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:12,991
He is Hai.

713
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,190
They are good friends.

714
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,990
Let's take a picture together.

715
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,930
He is Wakai.

716
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,910
He is Wakai.

717
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,570
He is Machiharu.

718
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,750
They have reconciled.

719
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,790
Good for you.

720
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,270
Don't lose him.

721
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,870
Take care of him.

722
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,520
After that, I was used as
a bait in the videos and photos they took.

723
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,480
Not only my parents, but also my friends.

724
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,940
I couldn't
talk to them about what I was doing.

725
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,520
I spent my days feeling fear and anxiety.

726
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,600
Mitsuha-san! Mitsuha-san!

727
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,060
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

728
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:12,940
Please stop it!

729
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,020
No, no, it's not like that.

730
00:55:15,485 --> 00:55:17,180
Mitsuha-san, I'm not your enemy.

731
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:22,420
It's not my fault. I couldn't
stop them because I was afraid of them.

732
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,180
Shun-kun and Kyu-kun
were so scary that I couldn't do anything.

733
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:31,380
That's why I was so nervous. I'm so sorry.

734
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:39,300
They seduce girls like Misa-san every day.

735
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,460
It's the worst.

736
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,140
It's the worst, right?

737
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,620
That's why I want you
to deliver the victim.

738
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,620
But...

739
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,560
But?

740
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:01,640
I think it's hard for
you to say that in such a bright mood.

741
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:06,980
But I can't bear
to see a girl in such a bad condition.

742
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Please.

743
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,120
Um...

744
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,700
If they come, I'll be in trouble.

745
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
I'll go.

746
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,500
Take care of the damage.

747
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,400
Please.

748
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
See you.

749
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,610
You!

750
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,770
What are you hiding?

751
00:56:59,405 --> 00:57:01,285
What are you going
to do with such a lifesaver? Hey, you.

752
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,950


753
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,721
What are you
going to do if we lose our friendship?

754
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,870
Our fun campus life will be ruined.

755
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,250
Hey.

756
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:17,450
Don't do anything weird.

757
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,430
I have a video of you moving around.

758
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,770
If you tell
anyone, I'll spread it in the dormitory.

759
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:34,140
Don't do anything that doesn't make sense.

760
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,440
You should drink this.

761
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,700
Drink it.

762
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,540
Drink it.

763
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,460
Hurry up.

764
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Drink it.

765
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,320
Drink it.

766
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Drink it.

767
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,240
Please.

768
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,590
Don't you drink it? It's boring. Hurry up.

769
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:57,690
Drink it.

770
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:58,970
Drink it.

771
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:13,710
You can drink more.

772
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,600
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

773
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,920
It feels good to drink
a lot, doesn't it? It's good.

774
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,750


775
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,310
I think I'm back to my old self.

776
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,370
Let me touch you.

777
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,750
Look at me.

778
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,030
Let me touch you.

779
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,750
I'm a big boy.

780
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,050
Let me touch you.

781
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,770
Do you feel good? I know you do.

782
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:52,710
It's getting
hot, isn't it? Yeah.

783
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:56,980


784
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,520
My body is getting really hot.

785
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,151
It's hot here too,
isn't it? Let him sleep.

786
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,340
Let him sleep.

787
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,300


788
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,860
It's a little hot.

789
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,570
That's right.

790
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,630
Come on, come on.

791
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,050
Come on, touch it, touch it, touch it.

792
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,570
Touch it.

793
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,810
How is it? That's right.

794
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:28,910


795
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:30,210
How's your hand?

796
00:59:30,211 --> 00:59:31,211
How is it? It's hard.

797
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,910


798
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
How about the
right paw? Here, here.

799
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,970


800
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:42,971
I will let you take a bath.

801
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Take a bath.

802
00:59:51,065 --> 01:00:01,160
Oh, good.

803
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,000
Good boy.

804
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,260
Good boy.

805
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,580
Let me lick you more gently.

806
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,340
Good boy.

807
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:13,780
Good boy.

808
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,320
Do you feel good?

809
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,780
Oh, you feel good.

810
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,510
Nao-chan,

811
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,360
Are you trying to let this girl go?

812
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,380
You are a bad boy.

813
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You are a bad boy.

814
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,120
How do you feel?

815
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,920
How do you feel?

816
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
Big.

817
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:29,700
Big?

818
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,880
Let me give you a treat.

819
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,260
Let me give you a treat.

820
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,220
Let me give you a treat.

821
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,340
You can do it by yourself.

822
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:36,420
You do it well.

823
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,860
You can do
it well, right? I see.

824
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,920


825
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,340
You are so good.

826
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,280
You are getting better.

827
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,100
You are getting better.

828
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,360
You are becoming a great man.

829
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,560
You are a good husband.

830
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,360
You are so good.

831
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,340
You are so good.

832
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:02,341
You are eating very well.

833
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,891
You have been doing
this since you were a baby, haven't you?

834
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,780
You are very good at it.

835
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,880
How is it? Is it good?

836
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,520
You are not energetic enough.

837
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,920
You should stick your tongue out.

838
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,780
You should stick your tongue out.

839
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,220
Here you are.

840
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:53,660
You can eat up to the back.

841
01:01:54,395 --> 01:01:56,380
You like the back, don't you?

842
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,740
You can eat up to the back.

843
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:06,000
Don't hit me.

844
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:32,950
Rin chan, come here.

845
01:02:34,705 --> 01:02:35,780
Rin chan, come here.

846
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,940
Rin chan, come here.

847
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,540
You can see the other
person's face clearly.

848
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,240
You have a very good expression.

849
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,580
Open your eyes.

850
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
Look at your eyes.

851
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,760
You have a lot of swelling.

852
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,140
What are you doing?

853
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,100
You are not good at this.

854
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,580
Do you understand?

855
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,780
Why
are you so grumpy? Say something.

856
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:30,830
Stop it.

857
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,261
We are having fun.

858
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,720
Do you feel good?

859
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:38,260
You feel good, don't you?

860
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,540
You feel good, don't you?

861
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,945
You feel good because
you were scared just now, don't you?

862
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,620
I'll do it by hand.

863
01:03:50,621 --> 01:03:51,701
I'll show you how to do it.

864
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:11,040
Show me how to do it.

865
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,140
Show me how to do it.

866
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,540
Show me.

867
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:18,990
Yes, yes.

868
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,170
Use your tongue.

869
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,790
Yes.

870
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,570
Lick it.

871
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,010
Lick, lick, lick.

872
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,180
Use your tongue.

873
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,440
Make more sound.

874
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,720
Yes.

875
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,480
Yes, that's good.

876
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,760
That's a good sound.

877
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:47,761
It's okay.

878
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,420
I'll give you some more.

879
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,870
Hey, Nano-kun.

880
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,390
Look at my erotic ferret.

881
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,710
Look at it.

882
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:14,290
Look at it.

883
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:15,530
Say it.

884
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,410
Look at my dirty hair.

885
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,370
You did a good job.

886
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:23,670
I'll give you a reward.

887
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,950
Do it by yourself.

888
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,390
Do it by yourself.

889
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,930
Hold his waist.

890
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,070
Hold his waist.

891
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,210
Yes.

892
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,300
Hold his waist.

893
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,750
Look at his dirty hair.

894
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:42,930
I'll lick it from the bottom.

895
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,411
You are looking at the other person's face.

896
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,470
Yes, that's right.

897
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:21,690
Yes, that's right.

898
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,901
Do you want me to massage your back?

899
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,850
Yes, that's right.

900
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,310
You have a lot of hair on this side, too.

901
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:35,970
You have a lot of hair on this side, too.

902
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,450
You have a lot of hair on your back.

903
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:44,950
I'm sorry.

904
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,371
You should hold your chin properly.

905
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:53,170
Yes, yes, yes.

906
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:55,610
Show me your favorite woman.

907
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:58,670
Your favorite person.

908
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,090
Nana, are you watching?

909
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,610
Nana, are you
watching? No, I'm not.

910
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,850


911
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,950
No?

912
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:08,570
You're not?

913
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,830
Show me your chin.

914
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,550
Wow, it's so sweet.

915
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,670
Swallow the bullet.

916
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,871
Swallow the bullet
and put it from the bottom to the top.

917
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Swallow.

918
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:27,420
Boom.

919
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
That's right.

920
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:31,905
Swallow a lot of bullets.

921
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,300
While moving your waist.

922
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,020
Swallow a lot of bullets.

923
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,840
While moving your waist.

924
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,140
Hey, you became erotic.

925
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,680
You have a funny face.

926
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,420
OK, lick your butthole.

927
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,220
Turn around.

928
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
Your butthole.

929
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,320
You can do it, can't you?

930
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,100
You can lick your butthole, can't you?

931
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,020
Lick your butthole.

932
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:12,440
Make it clean.

933
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:14,060
Let's take a look at your back.

934
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,560
You have a wide back.

935
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:25,340
Wow, you have a wide back.

936
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,600
Here is your head.

937
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,640
He is licking your back.

938
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,040
You can see it clearly.

939
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,440
You have to lick your belly, Bara-chan.

940
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,700
Pull your belly button, Bella-chan.

941
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,200
Pull your belly button like a tail.

942
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,880
Yes, like this.

943
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,560
Yes, that's good.

944
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,040
You are so gentle today.

945
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:07,216
You lick your belly
button from your butt to your butthole.

946
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,520
You can do it,
right? Yes, you can.

947
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,440


948
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,460
You are a good boy.

949
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,540
You are a good boy.

950
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,011
You have a very erotic expression.

951
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,600
You are the best.

952
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,540
You know it.

953
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,240
You like erotic things, don't you?

954
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,160
Don't you? That's right.

955
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,720
Look at me.

956
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,540
Look at me.

957
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,441
Look at me, Bardo.

958
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,440
You want to be licked.

959
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,860
I'll lick you.

960
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:48,460
It hurts.

961
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,950
You lick everyone's buttocks.

962
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,410
You are a pervert.

963
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:59,910
You are strange.

964
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:09,870
You are gross.

965
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,980
Nanao, you have a bad breath.

966
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,200
You have a bad breath.

967
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:26,201
Make more noise.

968
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,540
Nanao, you have a bad breath.

969
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:34,920
I don't have a bad breath.

970
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Nanao, take a bath.

971
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,941
If you don't take a
bath, I'll leave you here.

972
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:40,860
Wait a minute.

973
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,160
Nanao, you have a bad breath.

974
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
Really?

975
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,400
Everyone, touch Nanao.

976
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:48,240
Touch my dick.

977
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,880
You are serious.

978
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,940
You are so serious.

979
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,280
You are so serious.

980
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,490
You are a pervert.

981
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,740
Do it.

982
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,820
You are so nice.

983
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
You are a liar.

984
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,920
Wow, Tenko, you're so honest.

985
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,900
No, I'm not.

986
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,220
Drink some water.

987
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,200
What? Wait a minute.

988
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,660
What's that
voice? It's pathetic.

989
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:29,860


990
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,140
Are you a totem
pole? Go to sleep.

991
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,900
If you do that.

992
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,900
..

993
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,940
I'm sorry.

994
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,360
Oh, wait a minute.

995
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Oh, my God.

996
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,351
As you saw
earlier, I'm going to lick you from here.

997
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,660
Wait a minute.

998
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,080
I'm going to lick you a lot.

999
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:57,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1000
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:01,160
Oh, my God.

1001
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,200
From the bottom to the top.

1002
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,020
I'm going to make you drool.

1003
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:10,810
I'm going to lick you a little bit.

1004
01:12:10,811 --> 01:12:11,971
Why don't you drink
it first? No, no, no.

1005
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:13,650


1006
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:15,170
That's the back of the head.

1007
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,130
That's not good.

1008
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,350
Do you feel good?

1009
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:21,330
I don't feel good.

1010
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,186
I don't feel good.
What are you talking about?

1011
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:25,210
Why are you so grumpy?

1012
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,750
I'll give it to you.

1013
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,250
I'll give it to you while
looking at your nose.

1014
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,010
It's annoying, right? Oh, I see.

1015
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,630


1016
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:42,270
Do you like it
there? No, I don't.

1017
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,010


1018
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,370
You're pathetic.

1019
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,030
Why do you look like that?

1020
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,390
It's fine, isn't it?

1021
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,930
Do it more violently.

1022
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:54,290
What?

1023
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:54,830
Do it more violently.

1024
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,250
Do it more softly.

1025
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,630
No, I don't.

1026
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,690
I'm done.

1027
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:04,870
You're so stingy.

1028
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:06,990
No, I'm not.

1029
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:07,430
I'm not.

1030
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:08,830
Oh no! Let me do it.

1031
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,270
Let me do it.

1032
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,210
No, no, no.

1033
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,810
No, no.

1034
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,086
I'm not sure if you can do it.

1035
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,430
If you can do it, please tell me.

1036
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,210
No, no, no.

1037
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,850
No, no, no.

1038
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:31,350
No, no, no.

1039
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:33,150
No, no, no.

1040
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:34,090
No, no, no.

1041
01:13:34,091 --> 01:13:35,190
No, no, no.

1042
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:36,910
No, no, no.

1043
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:07,910
You are a good boy.

1044
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:14,290
It's fun to be licked
by a lot of Kenpo, isn't it?

1045
01:14:15,265 --> 01:14:18,470
You have a happy face, don't you?

1046
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,270
You have found it well, Kiyo-chan.

1047
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:31,030
It's a company with
my skirt, isn't it? It's the best.

1048
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,130


1049
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,090
You are getting better and better.

1050
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:39,970
How are you doing?

1051
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:46,250
Look at the person who is licking.

1052
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,331
Look at the person who is licking.

1053
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,970
Does it feel good?
Yes, yes, yes.

1054
01:14:56,285 --> 01:14:57,590
Ask him.

1055
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:00,910
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

1056
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,380


1057
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:10,631
Please put a lot of food in your mouth.

1058
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:23,190
Do you want a treat?

1059
01:15:26,185 --> 01:15:27,306
You want a treat, don't
you? It looks good.

1060
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:32,290


1061
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,861
You are feeling good, right?

1062
01:15:44,955 --> 01:15:49,950
You are feeling good, right?

1063
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:53,070
You are feeling good, right?

1064
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,290
Oh, it feels good

1065
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,070
Oh, it feels good.

1066
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,750
Oh, you are going to go.

1067
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:19,970
Oh, you are going to go.

1068
01:16:19,971 --> 01:16:20,971
You are amazing.

1069
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,270
Utsu-san, you can't go home today, can you?

1070
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,590
Take care of him.

1071
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,430
Oh, it feels good.

1072
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,230
I'll clean you up.

1073
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,650
Thank you.

1074
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:40,735
You look fashionable.

1075
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,250
Next.

1076
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:49,170
It suits you.

1077
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,680
Look at me.

1078
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:09,960
Lean on me.

1079
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:11,200
Stay close to me.

1080
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,890
Give me your hand.

1081
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,450
Give me your hand.

1082
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,910
You don't have to say it.

1083
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,140
Give me your hand.

1084
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,680
Give me your hand.

1085
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:21,440
Give me your hand.

1086
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:23,540
You have a bad breath.

1087
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,580
You have a bad breath.

1088
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,260
You have to stop breathing.

1089
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,220
You have to clean your body.

1090
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:52,110
You have a lot of mental problems.

1091
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,670
You have a bad breath.

1092
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,830
You look good in this.

1093
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,470
You're a smelly woman.

1094
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,430
I'm going to beat you up.

1095
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,950
Do you want to take a picture?

1096
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,090
Let's take a picture.

1097
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:32,470
Let's get together.

1098
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:35,110
Let's take a picture.

1099
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,530
Sit down.

1100
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,570
You're a big fan, aren't you?

1101
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:39,650
Let's take a picture.

1102
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,870
Look at the camera.

1103
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,990
Stand up.

1104
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,610
Smile.

1105
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:59,550
Smile.

1106
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:00,350
Smile.

1107
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:02,210
Smile.

1108
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:10,700
Since that
day, I was imprisoned by these men.

1109
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:14,960
Almost every day,
I was forced to prostitute.

1110
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:23,680
Love has been escalating day by day, and
my own body and heart have been worn out.

1111
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:15,960
Bye bye, Yari Yari!

1112
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,900
Cheers!

1113
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,290
That's a good drink, Emi-san.

1114
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:32,650
Do you want more?

1115
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:33,730
Cheers!

1116
01:21:33,731 --> 01:21:34,731
Cheers!

1117
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:43,390
It's a good drink.

1118
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,200
It's good.

1119
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,330
Haru-chan,
you've been around for a long time.

1120
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:57,870
Maybe you've fallen in love with her.

1121
01:21:58,930 --> 01:21:59,930
Maybe so.

1122
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,670
You've been drinking alone lately.

1123
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,310
Right? Oh, right.

1124
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:04,070
Hey, Tano.

1125
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:05,630


1126
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:07,970
Be my friend today.

1127
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:09,890
I see.

1128
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,050
You haven't asked me out yet, have you?

1129
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,990
Don't be a friend, not an acquaintance.

1130
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:17,730
That's right.
You want to be a friend, don't you?

1131
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,370
That's not what I'm saying.

1132
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:21,510
Can't you listen to
me? Like this.

1133
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:23,590
Like this.

1134
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:28,290


1135
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,821
If you don't be
a friend, you'll be taken by Gyu-chan.

1136
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,830
Are you sure? I'll take you.

1137
01:22:36,831 --> 01:22:37,831
He is a very good boy.

1138
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,070
You want to get
a cat's nail as a present, don't you?

1139
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:49,250
You are always like this.

1140
01:22:51,255 --> 01:23:03,230
You are so cute.

1141
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:12,940
You are so cute.

1142
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,340
You are wet.

1143
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,420
You too.

1144
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,060
You too.

1145
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,100
You are all wet.

1146
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,760
Kiku-chan, you are going to take it all.

1147
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,420
I'll do it for you.

1148
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:51,520
Chihara will lead you.

1149
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:01,580
You're already drooling.

1150
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,820
I'll show you.

1151
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:10,700
You want to do it, don't you?

1152
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:11,820
You're using your body.

1153
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,070
You want to do it, don't you?

1154
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:25,460
Please give my mother a kiss.

1155
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,980
How do you want to be kissed?

1156
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,041
How do you want to be petted?

1157
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,080
Do you want to be petted hard?

1158
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:49,320
Do you want to be petted hard?

1159
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,700
I'll pet you more.

1160
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,791
You don't want to be petted hard, do you?

1161
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,860
Do you want to be petted hard?

1162
01:25:02,895 --> 01:25:04,660
Does it feel good?

1163
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,760
Does it feel good?

1164
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:15,740
You have a bad breath.

1165
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,440
You have a nosebleed.

1166
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:40,200
You have a breast in front of you.

1167
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:43,980
Look! Here it is.

1168
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,580
It's a boob.

1169
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,420


1170
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,980
What are you going to do?

1171
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,300
If you don't
come, you'll be eaten by Gyo-chan.

1172
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,960
Look!

1173
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,580
What are you going to do?

1174
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,700
What are you gonna do?

1175
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,520
What are you gonna do?

1176
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:06,940
You wanna be attacked, right?

1177
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,900
You wanna be attacked, right?

1178
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,140
Yes.

1179
01:26:09,315 --> 01:26:11,040
I'm going to give you a kiss.

1180
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,560
You're getting a lot of kisses.

1181
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,160
Let's have sex.

1182
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:24,910
I'll give you a kiss.

1183
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,760
Don't push me.

1184
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:28,120
Finally, you are here.

1185
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:38,700
Look at me.

1186
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,460
Do you feel good?

1187
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,680
Yes.

1188
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:53,050
Good boy.

1189
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:00,570
How do you feel? It feels good.

1190
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,430
It feels good.

1191
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,690
That's good.

1192
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:06,691
It feels good.

1193
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:07,730


1194
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,330
You're going to fall.

1195
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:17,590
You're going to fall.

1196
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,050
Drink water.

1197
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,730
Drink water.

1198
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:23,990
Give me a kiss.

1199
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,870
It feels good, doesn't it?

1200
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:30,270
I can't do anything, so I'll do my best.

1201
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:39,870
I'll take off Nanao's clothes.

1202
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:47,400
I'll do my best.

1203
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,760
I'll do my best.

1204
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:11,760
You have a good sense of smell.

1205
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,340
I'll rub your belly.

1206
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:20,240
You rub your belly, don't you?

1207
01:28:21,595 --> 01:28:23,000
You are aggressive.

1208
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,400
Does it feel good?

1209
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,480
You are rubbing your belly.

1210
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,290
Let's go to bed.

1211
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:57,590
Oh, you went to bed.

1212
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:59,470
You are weird.

1213
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:01,310
You have a lot of hair.

1214
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,400
Do you feel good?

1215
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,460
Do you feel good?

1216
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,720
How do you feel? I don't know.

1217
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,860


1218
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:48,220
What are you doing?

1219
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:53,580
You have grown up.

1220
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,820
You have grown up.

1221
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:04,080
You are so fluffy.

1222
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,220
You are so fluffy.

1223
01:30:05,221 --> 01:30:06,520
Do you feel good? I feel good.

1224
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,420
You are feeling good?

1225
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,600
You are feeling good?

1226
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,780
Here?

1227
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,580
Do you want here?

1228
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,700
Do you want here?

1229
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:25,080
You want me to touch you, don't you?

1230
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:26,361
You are moving your waist a lot.

1231
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,220
You have become very skinny.

1232
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,600
What do you want me to do?

1233
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,060
Do you want me to touch you?

1234
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,440
You are moving a lot.

1235
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,520
You are moving a
lot, aren't you? Ok, look at me.

1236
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:48,680


1237
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,600
Where do you want to go?

1238
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,280
Spread your legs.

1239
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:00,730
Nana, hold her legs.

1240
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,080
Don't squirm.

1241
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,820
Hold her legs.

1242
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:13,980
What do you want to do?

1243
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:16,060
Do you want me to touch you?

1244
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,960
Where?

1245
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,100
Here?

1246
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:21,020
I'm going to tuck you in.

1247
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,060
Please do.

1248
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:27,880
What do you want me to do?

1249
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:28,921
What do you want me to do?

1250
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:32,760
I want you to touch me directly.

1251
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,280
Directly?

1252
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:35,820
Where do you want
me to touch you? Here.

1253
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,320


1254
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,796
I don't know where
you want me to touch you.

1255
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,240
Where is here?

1256
01:31:44,095 --> 01:31:44,880
What is here?

1257
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,020
Cleatress

1258
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,880
Cleatress is good, isn't it?

1259
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,940
Your cleatress is wet, isn't it?

1260
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:56,160
Do like this

1261
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,600
Here

1262
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,160
You have a hard time

1263
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:05,340
Do you feel good?

1264
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,600
Yes

1265
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:11,860
What are you doing?

1266
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:18,300
Open your mouth.

1267
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:22,320
Show me your chest.

1268
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,960
Here.

1269
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:31,740
This is your favorite place.

1270
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:56,770
You've gone.

1271
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,090
Wait, wait, I haven't put anything in it.

1272
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:12,950
Oh, good.

1273
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,660
You've put something in it.

1274
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,320
You've put two in it.

1275
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,860
Do you feel ticklish here?

1276
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,260
Does it feel good?

1277
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,800
What do you want me to do?

1278
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:36,660
What do you want me to do?

1279
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:39,951
What do you want
me to do? You are wet.

1280
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:58,650


1281
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:00,820
Clean your body.

1282
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:14,560
Clean my body.

1283
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:15,561
Let's clean your face.

1284
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,660
You've got a lot on your face, Kiyo-chan.

1285
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:30,080
What do you want?

1286
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,020
Do you feel good?

1287
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,220
Do you like it?

1288
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,180
Do you like it?

1289
01:34:38,181 --> 01:34:39,181
Do you like it?

1290
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:42,040
It's good, isn't it?

1291
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:44,600
What are you doing, Nanako?

1292
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,500
You've been staring at it.

1293
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,800
No, I haven't.

1294
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,420
You haven't, have you?

1295
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,220
You've been staring at it.

1296
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,120
Do you want more?

1297
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,120
Do you want more? Do you feel good?

1298
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:07,960
You can eat more by yourself.

1299
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,440
You can surprise yourself.

1300
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:14,640
Do you feel good?

1301
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:16,780
Do you want more?

1302
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:24,700
How about your throat?

1303
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,960
Do you feel good?

1304
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,980
Do you want more?

1305
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,300
Do you want more?

1306
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,780
OK.

1307
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,720
Look at me.

1308
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:45,010
Bring me a drink.

1309
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:52,500
Open your mouth.

1310
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,020
Drink.

1311
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,500
Good boy.

1312
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:03,800
You are drinking tea
together? No, I am not.

1313
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:06,240
I am not.

1314
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,841
You are drinking tea together.

1315
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,640
You are drinking tea together.

1316
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:13,641
OK, open your mouth.

1317
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,880
You have a lot of saliva.

1318
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,960
You have a lot of saliva.

1319
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,280
You have a lot of saliva.

1320
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,920
I'm going to put it down.

1321
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:38,200
You want it, don't you?

1322
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,520
I'm going to put it down.

1323
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:47,900
You're the first one to eat it.

1324
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,980
Does it feel good?

1325
01:36:52,230 --> 01:36:56,140
She is the
most likely to eat in the children's cave.

1326
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,540
She pushed the baby.

1327
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:03,910
She is going to the baby.

1328
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:12,010
Did you go?

1329
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,180
Do you feel good?

1330
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,680
You feel good, don't you?

1331
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:20,660
Let's get together.

1332
01:37:20,835 --> 01:38:07,680
If you have any
questions, please leave a comment.

1333
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,400
Don't open your mouth.

1334
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:14,780
You like to bite, don't
you? You bite, too.

1335
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,700


1336
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,220
You feel good, don't you?

1337
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,840
Oh, there you are.

1338
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,160
You are so strong.

1339
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:51,380
I'll lick you next time.

1340
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,440
I'll ask you to lick me.

1341
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:59,460
Lick me.

1342
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:00,461
Lick me.

1343
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:03,860
Lick me.

1344
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,580
He is in a good mood today.

1345
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,780
No, No, I want you to let him go.

1346
01:39:29,781 --> 01:39:31,040
I want you to let him go.

1347
01:39:44,460 --> 01:40:08,500
What's up?

1348
01:40:08,501 --> 01:40:09,980
You are going to the vet?

1349
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
You are going to the vet?

1350
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,420
Come here

1351
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,440
Do you want to go to the vet?

1352
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,180
You lick him

1353
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,490
Are you having fun?

1354
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:07,100
You like sex, don't you?

1355
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:11,411
I'll give you a lot of pills.

1356
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:13,880
I told you.

1357
01:41:13,881 --> 01:41:14,881
You lick me, don't you?

1358
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,960
Don't make a sexy face.

1359
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,180
You lick my head, too.

1360
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,880
You lick my head, too.

1361
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,020
Look at me.

1362
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:32,671
You have a place to lick more, don't you?

1363
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:37,360
You have a lot of tongue sticking out.

1364
01:41:44,570 --> 01:42:11,740
I'm going to take care of
my cats for a while, but I can't help it.

1365
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:15,600
I'm going to sleep.

1366
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,280
Do you feel good? I feel good.

1367
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,540
Good boy.

1368
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,720
Good boy.

1369
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:29,380
Good boy.

1370
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:30,220
Good boy.

1371
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,800


1372
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:37,780
Do you want to sleep?

1373
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:38,941
Do you want to sleep, Aokuma?

1374
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:53,210
You are so excited.

1375
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,140
You have a lot of saliva.

1376
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:02,360
You feel good, don't you?

1377
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,540
You feel good, don't you?

1378
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:06,111
Here, let me take care of you.

1379
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:43,090
I remove the chair.

1380
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:45,830
I pull out the chair.

1381
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,400
What is this?

1382
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:54,830
I love it!

1383
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:56,330
What is this?

1384
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,070
Teach me!

1385
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,190
This is a battery.

1386
01:43:59,310 --> 01:43:59,770
A battery?

1387
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:00,430
And then?

1388
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:01,530
And then?

1389
01:44:01,531 --> 01:44:02,910
Do you want
to go in? Please go in.

1390
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:05,490
Please go in.

1391
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:07,130
Please go in.

1392
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:09,430
Please go in.

1393
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,990


1394
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:13,370
OK, I'll let you in.

1395
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:16,610
OK, I'll let you in.

1396
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,910
It's like this as soon as you get in.

1397
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,680
You love sex, don't you?

1398
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:32,230
Are you feeling good?

1399
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:33,830
You are not moving.

1400
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:37,690
Are you saying that you are not moving?

1401
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:40,070
Oh, you felt it too much.

1402
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:45,370
You are saying that you are
feeling good because of your own squeaking.

1403
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,660
What do you mean?

1404
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:48,050
You are not moving yet.

1405
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:50,910
You are not moving.

1406
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:52,710
You are just opening your mouth.

1407
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:56,090
What do you want to do?

1408
01:44:57,525 --> 01:44:59,590
Do you want me to put you down?

1409
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:04,470
Are you surprised?

1410
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:07,110
Oh, you are strong.

1411
01:45:08,965 --> 01:45:31,850
You are strong
because you want me to put you down.

1412
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:47,690
Do you feel good?

1413
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,070
I was able to make it.

1414
01:46:05,071 --> 01:46:06,250
It's a baby.

1415
01:46:07,230 --> 01:46:08,370
It's not a baby.

1416
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:11,130
It's a baby.

1417
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:11,910
It's a baby.

1418
01:46:11,911 --> 01:46:13,250
You'd better hold it.

1419
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:15,510
Lie down.

1420
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:21,450
It's a baby.

1421
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,830
It's a baby.

1422
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:26,090
Spread your belly.

1423
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:28,150
Give me your hand.

1424
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:34,590
You have to put it in.

1425
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:45,610
You have to put it in.

1426
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:55,390
How are you?

1427
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:00,710
How are you?

1428
01:47:00,711 --> 01:47:01,711
Do you want me to do it?

1429
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:06,790
Ok Ok, do it more.

1430
01:47:06,791 --> 01:47:11,570
Do it more.

1431
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:13,710
Ok, ok.

1432
01:47:14,890 --> 01:47:16,750
Ok, ok.

1433
01:47:16,751 --> 01:47:17,890
Ok, ok.

1434
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:19,110
Do it more.

1435
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,230
Do it more.

1436
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:24,070


1437
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:25,870
Ok.

1438
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:31,170
You can move as you like.

1439
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:33,530
You can move as you like.

1440
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:35,950
You can move as you like.

1441
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,470
Don't kiss me too much.

1442
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,640
Do you feel good?

1443
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:19,411
They are very close to each other.

1444
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,170
They are clinging to each other.

1445
01:48:25,345 --> 01:48:26,345
No, I can't.

1446
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:28,710
I can't.

1447
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:31,250
I can't.

1448
01:48:31,251 --> 01:48:32,251
I can't.

1449
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:48,670
Good boy.

1450
01:48:48,910 --> 01:48:49,910
You are a big boy.

1451
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,360
You are a big boy.

1452
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:54,930
Good boy.

1453
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:56,770
Stand up.

1454
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:09,590
What's wrong with you, Misa?

1455
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:11,130
Did you find
something? I found it.

1456
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,570


1457
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:17,090
Let's decide it.

1458
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:23,330
Ready, set, go.

1459
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:31,610
He seems to be in a good mood.

1460
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,750
He is in a good mood.

1461
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:47,560
Good boy.

1462
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:54,940
He is in a good mood.

1463
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,660
He is in a good mood.

1464
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,080
He is a good boy.

1465
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:11,240
He is good at controlling himself.

1466
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,820
Lift your leg.

1467
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,540
Lift your leg again.

1468
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,920
Look at me.

1469
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:36,300
Can you see where I put my hand?

1470
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,580
You guys are so cheap.

1471
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,860
What?

1472
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:10,470
Can you see?

1473
01:51:10,471 --> 01:51:11,471
What are you doing?

1474
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:12,860
What are you doing?

1475
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:14,651
What are you doing? Hurry up!

1476
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:21,450
Oh, you drank it yourself.

1477
01:51:22,715 --> 01:51:23,966
It feels good, doesn't it?
It's good, isn't it?

1478
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:24,990
It's good, isn't it?

1479
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,590
It's good, isn't it?

1480
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:58,720
It's good, isn't it?

1481
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,520
Let's take a bath.

1482
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,180
This way, this way.

1483
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:04,980
Do you like it?

1484
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:09,420
Do you feel good?

1485
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,700
I'll put you on the bed.

1486
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:23,680
Poco is a little nervous.

1487
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,110
Poco is a little nervous.

1488
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,130
Poco is a little nervous.

1489
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:29,730
You're feeling good enough to run.

1490
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:31,250
You're feeling good enough to run.

1491
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:34,550
Turn your head this way.

1492
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:44,150
Turn your head this way.

1493
01:52:44,151 --> 01:52:45,966
You are in a good mood, so I will put
you on the bed.

1494
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:47,830
Please raise your body up.

1495
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,370
You look like you want to be hugged.

1496
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:14,540
You are surprised.

1497
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,080
You are great.

1498
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,720
Please hold this.

1499
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:40,891
Do you want me to
put your legs down? Get up.

1500
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:42,790


1501
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:47,211
I'll put you on my nipples.

1502
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:51,990
Move more.

1503
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,370
Move more.

1504
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:05,050
I'll put you on my nipples.

1505
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:23,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1506
01:54:23,351 --> 01:54:23,930
Mura-chan, Mura-chan.

1507
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:25,030
Raise one leg.

1508
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,181
The other leg is behind you.

1509
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:41,230
Look at me.

1510
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:42,370
Look at me.

1511
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:43,830
Look at the mirror from here.

1512
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:44,670
Look at the mirror from here.

1513
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:46,030
Good boy, yes.

1514
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:55,000
Mura-chan, you are too much.

1515
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,340
Hold him.

1516
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,060
Hold him.

1517
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,520
Let's take his legs.

1518
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,340
Let's take his legs.

1519
01:55:02,341 --> 01:55:03,341
Let's take a bath

1520
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,740
Good morning

1521
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:36,530
Do you feel good?

1522
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:41,070
Do you want to take a bath more deeply?

1523
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:20,051
Today, I'm going to show you a video
of my cat, Yo-rai, who is in a good mood.

1524
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,760
Yo-rai, who is in a
good mood, seems to be in a good mood.

1525
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:41,230
Yo-rai, who is in a
good mood, seems to be in a good mood.

1526
01:56:45,280 --> 01:57:10,960
You have the
cutest face when you are having sex.

1527
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:18,180
You have the
cutest face when you are having sex.

1528
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,560
Do you feel good?

1529
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:31,760
I want you to open your mouth.

1530
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:34,260
Can I open your mouth?

1531
01:58:34,261 --> 01:58:35,500
Can I open your mouth?

1532
01:58:37,895 --> 01:58:39,576
You want me to open your mouth, don't you?

1533
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:52,480
Let's go to the vet.

1534
01:58:52,481 --> 01:58:53,481
Let's go to the vet.

1535
01:59:07,470 --> 01:59:10,010
You are sleepy.

1536
01:59:10,011 --> 01:59:11,011
I'm going to sleep.

1537
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,040
Do you feel good?

1538
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,870
I'm going to sleep.

1539
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:18,810
Please get up.

1540
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:25,930
Please get up.

1541
02:01:58,650 --> 02:01:59,650
Someone came.

1542
02:02:01,170 --> 02:02:02,550
Did someone call you? I'll go.

1543
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:04,130
No.

1544
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:04,650
Atma?

1545
02:02:05,190 --> 02:02:05,730
No.

1546
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:06,530
Higashiko?

1547
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:07,170
No.

1548
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:09,310
I'm sorry, Kibu-chan.

1549
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:23,270
I'm sorry.

1550
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:30,230
We'll search her for a crime of adultery.

1551
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:52,080
Search.
