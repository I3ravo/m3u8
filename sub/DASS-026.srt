1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It was fun.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,500
It was fun, wasn't it?

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,661
It's been a while since we went
to the aquarium. How was it?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,880
It's been a long time.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,776
Don't you want to go to the zoo next time?

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,200
I want to go.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Let's go.

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,120
But you're going to be
an intern from tomorrow.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,696
Are you looking forward to it?

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,260
I'm looking forward to it.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,260
Because I can meet Ryoji Yamada,
who I've always wanted to meet.

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,440
The world-famous Ryoji Yamada.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,020
Yes.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,680
I can finally meet him.

15
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,001
I'm really looking forward to it.

16
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,980
I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
I see.

18
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,660
I feel like you're going
to be far away from me.

19
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,220
I'm not going to leave you.

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Don't cheat on me.

21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,920
I won't.

22
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
Really?

23
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,590
I won't cheat on you.

24
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,800
Well, I believe in that.

25
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,460
Yes.

26
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,140
You can trust me.

27
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,000
But you know what?

28
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
Yes.

29
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,820
The reason I wanted to be a designer
was because I saw your design.

30
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,220
Yes.

31
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,640
I can't believe I can work
for someone I respect.

32
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,820
I'm really looking forward to it.

33
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm happy to see you, too.

34
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,460
Please support me.

35
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,220
I'll do my best.

36
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,340
I'll do my best.

37
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
Good luck.

38
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,780
Let's go on a lot of dates.

39
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
Yes, let's do that.

40
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,260
Do you think we'll be able to meet?

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Yes, we will.

42
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
It's a promise.

43
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
This is a promise, too.

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,320
A pinky promise.

45
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,660
A pinky promise.

46
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,980
What if I lie?

47
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
A pinky promise.

48
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,380
A pinky promise.

49
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,356
It's our first time to
make a pinky promise.

50
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,380
Yes.

51
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Let's do our best.

52
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,380
Yes, let's do our best.

53
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:34,190
Everyone, please look at me.

54
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,450
She is Meisa Kawakita, who is going to work
as an intern at our company for a week.

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,610
Say hello to her.

56
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Nice to meet you.

57
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,510
I'm Meisa Kawakita.

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,210
I'm honored to work at your company.

59
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,470
I'll do my best, so please support me.

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,520
Ryoji Yamada.

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
What's the matter?

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Nothing.

63
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
What?

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,100
Ryoji Yamada isn't here?

65
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,600
This is Ryoji Yamada.

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,040
Say hello to him.

67
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,160
Hello, I'm Ryoji Yamada.

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,140
I'm glad that you respect me.

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
What?

70
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,971
You look different from
what I saw in the magazine.

71
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
What?

72
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,040
I asked someone else to be my assistant.

73
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm not interested in position and
reputation, so I don't want to be disturbed.

74
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:56,455
It affects my design.

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,820
I see.

76
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
You're very conscious.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,020
Your seat is over there.

78
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
I've prepared your seat.

79
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,940
Why am I Ryoji Yamada?

80
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,440
Yamada was conscious, so we made him move.

81
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,010
He came here because he admires you.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,230
Let him see you.

83
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,750
I see.

84
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,650
If you do that, you can do a lot of things.

85
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:41,651
Were you dead?

86
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,010
Do your best.

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,090
This is a sample of your design.

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,600
Have you ever seen such a tool?

89
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,270
Yes.

90
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:13,780
I've respected you for a long time.

91
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Have you?

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm glad to hear that.

93
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,100
I like your unique design.

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
My unique design?

95
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm often told that.

96
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,640
You want me to teach you, don't you?

97
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Yes.

98
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,200
It's different from what I imagined.

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,680
It's written there.

100
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,681
It's not what I imagined.

101
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
It's all imaginative.

102
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,541
It's a good idea, isn't it?

103
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
I came up with it.

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Really?

105
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
It's amazing, isn't it?

106
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,540
I'm here, so I don't care
about the atmosphere.

107
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,460
If the company is a little
dirty, it's my imagination.

108
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
It's my imagination.

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,100
It's my imagination.

110
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,101
It's my imagination.

111
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,220
Then, I'll make a park here.

112
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Mr. Koizumi, do you have some time?

113
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,060
I don't have much time.

114
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,410
I got it.

115
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,590
I'll make it brighter.

116
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:54,570
I'd better use red here.

117
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,890
Here?

118
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,110
Contrast is important for design.

119
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,270
I see.

120
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,500
It's yellow here.

121
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,120
Here?

122
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
Yes.

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
I see.

124
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
I like it.

125
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,240
Really?

126
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
It's well done.

127
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Thank you.

128
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,060
You have a good sense.

129
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
The gradation is good.

130
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
This one?

131
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes.

132
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:29,140
I see.

133
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,440
I'll put it back.

134
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,080
I like it.

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,720
It's a good design.

136
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,200
Thank you.

137
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
It's well done.

138
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,900
I was particular about this part.

139
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
I see.

140
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,080
Mr. Koizumi.

141
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,640
You have a good sense.

142
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,640
Let me see.

143
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,860
I like it.

144
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
It's hard to get that color.

145
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Really?

146
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm glad.

147
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
No one can do this.

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Thank you.

149
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,460
It's wonderful.

150
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,120
I like it.

151
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
I'll continue.

152
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Okay.

153
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,040
I was taught by a designer whom I admire.

154
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,640
I've never been so happy.

155
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:24,681
I've never been like this.

156
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
You're doing great.

157
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Thank you.

158
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,220
Can you bring me that one?

159
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,900
It's big.

160
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,120
Can you bring me that one?

161
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,750
It's great.

162
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,710
Really?

163
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,390
It's well done.

164
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,170
It's a good color.

165
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,330
I was particular about this hat.

166
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,490
Isn't it blue?

167
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,190
That's right.

168
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:55,191
I've changed the color.

169
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,470
It's good.

170
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,390
It's emerald green.

171
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,330
That's right.

172
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,370
I've unified this part.

173
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Hello?

174
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,260
How was your first day of internship?

175
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
It was great.

176
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,330
It was the most fulfilling time in my life.

177
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,780
I'm glad to hear that.

178
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:11,781
Did you have fun?

179
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Yes.

180
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

181
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I see.

182
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Do your best.

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Yes.

184
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,780
I'm glad to meet someone whom I admire.

185
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,660
He was a strange person.

186
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Yes.

187
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Yes.

188
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll finish it in five days.

189
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Thank you.

190
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,560
I'll go out for a while.

191
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Do your best.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's great.

193
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,400
Really?

194
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,620
I'm looking forward to it.

195
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Thank you.

196
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Thank you.

197
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,401
Mr. Yamada.

198
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,530
Yes?

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
How was it?

200
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,580
No.

201
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,620
I don't want to talk to you.

202
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
What did you learn in college?

203
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,550
Hey.

204
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,920
It's not my hobby.

205
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,980
It's my job.

206
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,840
Do you understand?

207
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:10,841
What?

208
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
I can't believe it.

209
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,860
I can't believe it.

210
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,060
I can't believe it.

211
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,080
Calm down.

212
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
You can't do it.

214
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,020
You can't do it.

215
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,260
Don't tell me that you admire me.

216
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,320
I admire you.

217
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:36,420
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,340
Why did you make this?

219
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,360
You're exaggerating.

220
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,580
I just joined the company.

221
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,600
It doesn't matter.

222
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I know.

223
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Are you interested in designing companies?

224
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,500
Why did you make this?

225
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,060
It's a good label.

226
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,980
Do you like it?

227
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm going to work.

230
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,180
You're too much.

231
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,620
I'm sure he's a good person.

232
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,060
He's a good person.

233
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:27,061
He's a good person.

234
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,880
He's a good designer.

235
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
He's a good designer.

236
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,620
Do your best.

237
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Okay?

238
00:14:44,330 --> 00:15:20,170
Can I talk to you?

239
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,530
I have something to tell you.

240
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:25,770
Can I talk to you?

241
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,870
Come with me.

242
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,150
Okay.

243
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,090
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,350
I have something to tell you.

245
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,430
Okay.

246
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:06,690
You want to learn more
about design, don't you?

247
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,330
Yes.

248
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,120
Show me your motivation.

249
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Motivation?

250
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,200
You admire me, don't you?

251
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Yes.

252
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:30,400
I'll give you a lot of inspiration.

253
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:33,460
I'll give you a lot of inspiration.

254
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,170
You want me to teach you, don't you?

255
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,330
I'll give you a lot of inspiration.

256
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,190
I want you to teach me.

257
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,631
You want me to teach you, don't you?

258
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,630
I'll teach you a lot of things.

259
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,310
You said you wanted to study design.

260
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,820
Don't do that.

261
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,620
You need this to get inspiration.

262
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,440
Akita.

263
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,670
Don't do that.

264
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,490
Relax.

265
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,030
You can't get inspiration by doing that.

266
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,230
I don't think so.

267
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,890
Why?

268
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,390
Don't do that.

269
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,860
You can't get inspiration by doing that.

270
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,830
No.

271
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,910
You said you wanted me
to teach you, didn't you?

272
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
This is strange.

273
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,470
This is an education.

274
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Don't do that.

275
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Don't do that.

276
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,710
Relax.

277
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:42,711
Look at me.

278
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,490
I have a boyfriend.

279
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,530
You can't have a boyfriend.

280
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,350
You have to devote everything to art.

281
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,210
Does this have anything to do with art?

282
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,530
This is an education.

283
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,490
Don't do that.

284
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,530
Design starts with sex.

285
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
I'll teach you.

286
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,560
This is strange.

287
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:48,130
You said you wanted me
to teach you, didn't you?

288
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,910
You're wrong.

289
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,230
This is wrong.

290
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,650
I'll teach you the essence of design.

291
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,651
Look at me.

292
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,150
Yamada-San.

293
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:48,910
I'll teach you.

294
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,930
Don't do that.

295
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:16,480
Look at me.

296
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:27,220
This is wrong.

297
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,210
This is very beautiful.

298
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,830
This is very good.

299
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,930
Don't do that.

300
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,030
You can leave it to me.

301
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,930
This is strange.

302
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:03,150
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,810
Are you tired?

304
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,350
It's okay.

305
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,030
What's wrong?

306
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,030
This is how you do it.

307
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:16,031
This is how you do it.

308
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,890
You get inspired.

309
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:36,280
It's okay.

310
00:23:36,460 --> 00:24:09,900
Don't do that.

311
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
You feel good, don't you?

312
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,600
This is strange.

313
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Look at me.

314
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
What's wrong?

315
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,610
You feel good, don't you?

316
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,870
Don't do that.

317
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,650
You feel good, don't you?

318
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,250
Are you getting better?

319
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,330
Don't do that.

320
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,331
I'm sorry.

321
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,560
You're getting better, aren't you?

322
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,100
You're getting better, aren't you?

323
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:07,120
This is the most important part.

324
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:16,780
You feel good, don't you?

325
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:49,400
Don't do that.

326
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,740
You're getting better.

327
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:08,741
You're getting better.

328
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,720
What are you doing here?

329
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:39,380
You're getting better.

330
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,650
Do you feel good here?

331
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,220
You get inspired.

332
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,400
You feel good here, don't you?

333
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,760
Don't do that.

334
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
I'm sorry.

335
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,420
You feel good here, don't you?

336
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,780
You're getting better.

337
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,180
You like this place, don't you?

338
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:21,360
You're getting better.

339
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,430
You're getting better.

340
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,930
You're getting better.

341
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:41,931
You're getting better.

342
00:33:43,650 --> 00:34:20,110
What's wrong?

343
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:36,200
Look at me.

344
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
I'm your imagination.

345
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,120
You have a misunderstanding, don't you?

346
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,480
Don't have a misunderstanding.

347
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,311
You have a misunderstanding, don't you?

348
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Don't do that.

349
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,140
I'll do it for you next time.

350
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,461
You admire this place, don't you?

351
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,390
You understand, don't you?

352
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,840
It hurts so much, doesn't it?

353
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,280
I'll do it for you.

354
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Come here.

355
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
I'll do it for you.

356
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:18,930
This is also an art house.

357
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,870
You're getting bigger and bigger.

358
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,810
Do you feel it?

359
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:37,390
Look at me.

360
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,290
Do what you want.

361
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,950
That's right.

362
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,440
You're getting better and better.

363
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
It feels good.

364
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,640
You understand art.

365
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:35,900
You understand art, don't you?

366
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,150
That's right.

367
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:09,100
If you lick a lot of gold bars,
you'll have a lot of imagination.

368
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Lick it up.

369
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,830
Lick it up.

370
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
That's right.

371
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,030
Do it harder.

372
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,270
You're getting better, don't you?

373
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:50,271
I'll do it for you.

374
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
Wait.

375
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,820
This is art.

376
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,900
This is the most important thing.

377
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,410
This is where art is born.

378
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,730
This is where art is born.

379
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,730
You understand, don't you?

380
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,670
This is art.

381
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,070
It's starting.

382
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:53,010
This is the best art.

383
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,650
You understand, don't you?

384
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,360
You understand, don't you?

385
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,290
You understand what?

386
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,270
You're getting bigger and bigger.

387
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:29,271
I'll show you.

388
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:47,786
This is where it feels good.

389
00:43:56,720 --> 00:45:09,850
This is where it feels good.

390
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,750
What's wrong?

391
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:18,790
I don't want to do it anymore.

392
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,000
This is the most important thing.

393
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,120
You're getting better and better.

394
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,800
I don't want to do it anymore.

395
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:43,480
You're getting inspiration, aren't you?

396
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,400
Don't put it in here.

397
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:47,640
This is the best place.

398
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,250
This is the last one.

399
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,770
I'll give you this, too.

400
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,810
No, no, no.

401
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:42,340
Mr. Yamada, why?

402
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,520
This is education.

403
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:49,940
This is Ryoji Yamada.

404
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,820
Ryoji Yamada's real art is sex.

405
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,340
I thought I was fooled.

406
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,700
Change the design again.

407
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:17,860
It's about the material you ordered.

408
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,260
Is that so?

409
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,340
Two weeks later.

410
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
That's right.

411
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:26,340
If you do that, you'll be
able to meet the deadline.

412
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,900
I see.

413
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,740
I'll ask you again later.

414
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,430
Thank you.

415
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,240
It's been a week.

416
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,920
I'm going to cry.

417
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,840
What's wrong?

418
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,600
A client asked me to change the design.

419
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,140
That's what I'm talking about.

420
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,240
Really?

421
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,020
It's not just that we don't have time.

422
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,900
We don't have time.

423
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,700
I really don't know.

424
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,060
I heard that this is older.

425
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,780
That's right.

426
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,760
Mr. Yamada.

428
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,080
Please.

429
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,880
I've never seen this design before.

430
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,780
This color doesn't change at all.

431
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,990
Beautiful.

432
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,300
This is the best.

433
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,840
Everyone, look at this.

434
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:36,180
Take a look at this.

435
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,460
Did you draw this?

436
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,380
Look at this.

437
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,800
I've never seen this before.

438
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,720
How to use this color.

439
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,200
It's a good idea.

440
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,781
You can do this even though
you're an internship student?

441
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,520
That's amazing.

442
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,820
How did you come up with this?

443
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,380
This is similar to RYOJI Yamada.

444
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,840
I was conscious of it.

445
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,740
I see.

446
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,420
Can I give you the second RYOJI Yamada?

447
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,720
You have to be careful.

448
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,520
You can't lose.

449
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,600
That's amazing.

450
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
You can do this.

451
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,960
You can do this right away.

452
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,060
You look like you're alive.

453
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,960
You're alive.

454
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,620
That's amazing.

455
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,000
We can announce a new product.

456
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,160
This is a world-class product.

457
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,560
I'm sure of it.

458
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,380
I'm sure this will be popular this year.

459
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,660
You've created a new era.

460
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,540
That's good.

461
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
How do you feel?

462
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,540
I'm happy.

463
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,440
He's happy, so he's going to dance.

464
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,500
That's right.

465
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,820
He's happy, so he's going to dance.

466
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:00,160
This is RYOJI Yamada.

467
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,440
You can do this.

468
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,390
KAZUYA.

469
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,190
Yes.

470
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,530
Can I talk to you for a moment?

471
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,450
What is it?

472
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,310
I want to talk to you about the design.

473
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,950
Can I talk to you for a moment?

474
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:23,430
Yes.

475
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,371
I had sex the other day,
so my design has improved.

476
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,120
AKITA.

477
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,380
I want you to talk to me.

478
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
Why?

479
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,960
It's necessary for design.

480
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,701
It's necessary to get inspiration.

481
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
I can't.

482
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,130
It doesn't matter.

483
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,910
There are many people who want to
be a designer because they admire me.

484
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,831
There are many people
who want to be a designer.

485
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,050
Can I talk to you for a moment?

486
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,431
It was your dream to join
this company, wasn't it?

487
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,160
Yes.

488
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,901
You understand, don't you?

489
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,190
Take this off.

490
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,230
Can't you do it?

491
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:00,231
You can't do it.

492
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:07,296
If you don't have
the attitude to devote

493
00:58:07,308 --> 00:58:11,130
everything to art, you
can't stop being a designer.

494
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:21,080
Take this off.

495
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,260
You can do it, right?

496
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:51,565
That's right.

497
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,050
This too?

498
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:56,790
It's necessary for art.

499
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:57,791
It's necessary for art.

500
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,610
Come on.

501
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,480
Show me your beautiful chest.

502
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,840
It's necessary for art.

503
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:38,316
You understand, don't you?

504
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,661
You want to be a top designer, don't you?

505
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
This is necessary.

506
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
It's a good bra.

507
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,580
It's a good design.

508
01:00:06,581 --> 01:00:07,581
It's a good design.

509
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,360
Why are you embarrassed?

510
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,240
You can't be a designer if
you don't be more active.

511
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,820
Yes.

512
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,120
You have a good taste.

513
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,260
It's a good design.

514
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,960
What's wrong?

515
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,490
This too?

516
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:01,870
Why are you embarrassed?

517
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,070
Can you stop being a short-tempered?

518
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,041
You can't be a top designer
if you don't be more active.

519
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:36,260
It's a good design.

520
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,660
Take this off.

521
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Show me your nipples.

522
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,410
I'll introduce you to many people.

523
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:54,771
I'll introduce you to many people.

524
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,690
It's important to be
active in this industry.

525
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,070
You understand, don't you?

526
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,310
Yes.

527
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:29,690
There are many famous
designers in this city.

528
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,921
I'll introduce you to many people.

529
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,910
Show me your nipples.

530
01:02:37,911 --> 01:02:38,911
Show me your nipples.

531
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:41,861
You're hiding your nipples.

532
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,710
If you work hard, you
can be a top designer.

533
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,680
You want to be a top designer, don't you?

534
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,200
Everyone admires you.

535
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,080
I'm here.

536
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,300
Show me your nipples.

537
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:19,350
If you listen to me, I'll eat you.

538
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,310
What's wrong?

539
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,010
I'm here.

540
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,070
Don't do that.

541
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,220
I want to have sex.

542
01:03:55,870 --> 01:04:04,490
Do you know Akezaki Aiba?

543
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,660
He's my apprentice.

544
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,520
All the girls I taught are top designers.

545
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,481
If you work hard, you
can be a top designer.

546
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:50,040
I'm sorry.

547
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,460
Don't do that.

548
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,320
You want to be a top designer, don't you?

549
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
It's enough.

550
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,440
What are you talking about?

551
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,930
Show me your nipples.

552
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:09,730
I can't.

553
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,530
If you work hard, you
can be a top designer.

554
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,611
I'll introduce you to many top designers.

555
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:47,300
Show me your nipples.

556
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,240
I don't want to.

557
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,291
Do you want me to introduce
you to many top designers?

558
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,190
Who are you?

559
01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:07,450
I'm sorry.

560
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,960
Hello.

561
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,480
Thank you for your hard work.

562
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,481
Thank you.

563
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,080
Are you a designer?

564

01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,010
That's right.

571
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,200
Thank you.

572
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,260
I'm really happy to get a job again.

573
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,860
Is the design old?

574
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,361
What are you talking about?

575
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,040
It's not old.

576
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,041
It's not old.

577
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:32,940
Are you doing well?

578
01:07:41,675 --> 01:07:43,030
I want you to work hard.

579

I want you to work harder.

580

Do you understand me?

Do you feel good?

607
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,890
Don't take a break.

608
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:40,110
I'll suck you in.

609
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,120
I'll suck you in.

610
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,390

Do you feel good?

615
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,840
I'll get you out of here.

616
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,760
I'll get you out of here.

617
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,840
Yes.

618
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,680
Did your father teach you
the inspiration for Yamada?

619
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,190
Do you want me to tell you?

620
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:59,230
Do you want me to tell you?

621

Do you want me to tell you?

622
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:14,710
You came to my house for an internship.

623
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:19,370
I'll teach you a lot of things.

624
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,110
No.

625
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:42,370
I've been waiting for you.

626
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,180
I needed your help for
the inspiration for Yamada.

627
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,740
Help?

628
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,440
I'll help you.

629
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:30,840
You don't have to do this.

630
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:33,535
What are you doing?

631
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,900
I told you.

632
01:20:36,235 --> 01:20:37,640
This is what you need.

633
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
That's right.

634
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,320
No.

635
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,400
That's right.

636
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,360
This will give you a lot of colors.

637
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,220
This is the world of RYOJI Yamada.

638
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,160
Do you understand?

639
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,180
Your body is getting hotter.

640
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,920
RYOJI Yamada, I'll show you your world.

641
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:35,100
I'll show you your world.

01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,350
This is the world that comes to mind.

643
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:48,980
Do you understand?

644
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,880
This is a design.

645
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:55,980
This is art.

646
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:13,320
This is art.

647
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,640
This is art.

648
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:17,641
This is art.

649
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,080
This is art.

650
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:43,030
This will give you a lot of ideas.

651
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:45,030
Do you understand?

652
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,380
That's right.

653
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,690
This will give you a lot of inspiration.

654
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:54,190
A new design will be decided.

655
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,690
This is art.

656
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:18,870
This will give you a lot of ideas.

657
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:21,350
This color is wonderful.

658

That's right.

659
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:33,440
This pink color is wonderful.

660
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,640
Let's look behind you.

661
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,940
Lean back.

662
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,400
That's right.

663
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:45,840
That's right.

664
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:55,940
This will give you a lot of ideas.

665
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:14,960
This is beautiful.

That's right.

This will give you a lot of ideas.

672
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:38,790
The next design is this round shape.

673
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:40,230
That's right.

674
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:42,390
This is important.

675
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:49,350
Can you follow me?

676
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,470
I'll show you the world of RYOJI.

677
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,950

That's right.

680
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,060
Sound, color, and smell.

681
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,860
All of these come together to create art.

682
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,520
That's the world of RYOJI.

683
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,340
I'll show you.

684
01:25:26,285 --> 01:25:27,940
This is colorful.

685
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,540
What does it mean?

686
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:39,076

That's right.

688
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
You have a good voice.

689
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:16,000
By making that voice,
a new color will be born.

690
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,060
Sound, color, and harmony.

691
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,580
This is the world of RYOJI.

692
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:36,900
This is art.

693
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,110
That's right.

694
01:26:38,111 --> 01:26:39,111
That's right.

695
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
This will give you a lot of ideas.

696
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,700
This will give you a lot of ideas.

697
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,480
This is art.

698
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:03,720
This is RYOJI.

699
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,130
This is blue.

700
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,650
This looks like blue.

701
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,110
Look at this.

702
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:23,010
What's going on now?

703
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,750
This looks like blue, doesn't it?

704
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:31,450
If you can't see it, you
don't understand art yet.

705
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:32,550
That's right.

706
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:35,980
This is art.

707
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,520
That's right.

708
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,820
Here, too.

709
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:39,480
Here, too.

710
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,760
Look at this.

711
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,630
That's art.

712
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,600
There is art in this.

713
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:37,350
That's art.

714
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:40,590
This is art.

715
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:43,850
What is this?

716
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,160
Take this off right now.

717
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,980
You don't need this.

718
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:03,980
You don't need this in art.

719
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:10,060
What you need in art is the way it is.

720
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,620
That's right.

721
01:29:12,621 --> 01:29:12,880
That's the material.

722
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,500
That's right.

723
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:24,065
The more you look at
what kind of material it

724
01:29:24,077 --> 01:29:33,780
is, the more you will
be inspired by this state.

725
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,210
This is it.

726
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,420
That's right.

727
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:52,840
This will increase your sensitivity.

728
01:29:52,841 --> 01:29:54,281
This will increase your sensitivity.

729
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,400
This is good.

730
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,080
Hold this.

731
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,360
That's right.

732
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,620
You can hold this.

733
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,160
Hold this.

734
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,840
That's right.

735
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:35,190
That's right.

736
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:44,470
I'll show you how much you've grown.

737
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:47,610
I'll show you how much you've grown.

738
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:50,230
This is Paris.

739
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:52,830
This is Japan.

740
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:05,160
And this is Japan.

741
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,860
In all countries, children are recognized.

742
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:15,090
You know that, right?

743
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,390
That's good.

744
01:31:21,391 --> 01:31:22,391
That's good.

745
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:25,170
That's right.

746
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:38,720
You've grown.

747
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,580
You haven't done it yet.

748
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,020
That's good.

749
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:17,530
What's wrong?

750
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:28,090
Please let me go.

751
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,190
I can't hear you.

752
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:33,070
Please let me go.

753
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,940
If you want me to go, ask for more.

754
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:47,580
That's right.

755
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,620
You have to ask for it yourself.

756
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:52,780
That's right.

757
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:53,980
That's right.

758
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:04,180
That's right.

759
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:04,940
That's right.

760
01:33:04,941 --> 01:33:05,020
That's good.

761
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:13,200
If this makes you feel good,
it's a proof that you're an artist.

762
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,920
You don't have to do it
yourself if you feel good.

763
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:31,200
That's right.

764
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,900
That's good.

765
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,420
You can't say that you're going.

766
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:43,780
Hold on.

767
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,020
That's right.

768
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:46,820
You have to change.

769
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,880
You have to be moved.

770
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:52,780
That's right.

771
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,360
You have to make art explode.

772
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,230
Let's make your art explode.

773
01:34:09,231 --> 01:34:10,351
Let's make your art explode.

774
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:47,040
If you don't do it, you'll be moved.

775
01:34:48,675 --> 01:34:49,800
Look back slowly.

776
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,420
That's right.

777
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,720
You can't say that you're going.

778
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:01,380
That's right.

779
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:09,240
This forum is artistic, isn't it?

780
01:35:09,241 --> 01:35:10,241
Isn't it?

781
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,400
That's right.

782
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,180
It's getting more and more artistic.

783
01:35:22,625 --> 01:35:24,260
Let's make it explode more.

784
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,920
That's right.

785
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,220
That's right.

786
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,860
It's getting more and more artistic.

787
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,250
Here?

788
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:50,900
That's right.

789
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,640
You have to change the
speed and depth of movement.

790
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:01,280
It's getting more and more artistic.

791
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:03,020
That's right.

792
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,920
Do you want more?

793
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:08,940
Do you want more?

794
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,120
Do you want more?

795
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,760
You can't say that you're going.

796
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:17,380
Look.

797
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,540
You can't say that you're going.

798
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,720
That's right.

799
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:28,840
Art is like an endless journey.

800
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:33,900
That's right.

801
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:35,440
That's right.

802
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,300
It's not over just because
you've been there once.

803
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,020
Do you understand?

804
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,280
Do you remember?

805
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,700
Art is something.

806
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:49,960
That's right.

807
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,800
It's not over yet.

808
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:19,340
It's not over yet.

809
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,760
You can't say that you're going.

810
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,940
You can't say that you're going.

811
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:25,460
Art is something beyond that.

812
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,440
That's right.

813
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,760
That's right.

814
01:37:41,761 --> 01:37:42,761
That's right.

815
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,420
That's right.

816
01:37:47,140 --> 01:38:05,930
You can't say that you're going.

817
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:10,300
It's getting more and more artistic.

818
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:32,640
You can't say that you're going.

819
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:55,130
You can't say that you're going.

820
01:38:55,131 --> 01:38:55,750
That's right.

821
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:56,890
Show your color.

822
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,200
Show your color.

823
01:38:58,530 --> 01:38:59,530
That's right.

824
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,340
You can't say that you're going.

825
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:16,500
It's beyond that.

826
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:19,500
It's beyond that.

827
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,120
That's right.

828
01:39:51,940 --> 01:40:19,550
I think you got a new design.

829
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:25,130
I got a great inspiration.

830
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:27,230
It's all thanks to you.

831
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:28,231
That's right.

832
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,230
Thank you so much for today.

833
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,760
Hello?

834
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,720
I'm sorry I couldn't call you.

835
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,140
I've been busy with work lately.

836
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:52,700
I'm sorry.

837
01:40:52,701 --> 01:40:53,701
I'm sorry.

838
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,800
I've been busy with work lately.

839
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,060
I'm sorry I made you worry.

840
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:28,450
Art is something.

841
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:29,830
That's right.

842
01:43:25,420 --> 01:45:43,690
You can't say that you're going.

843
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,660
That's right.

844
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:48,800
You're doing great.

845
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:50,720
That's right.

846
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:51,800
I'm doing great.

847
01:45:51,801 --> 01:45:51,940
What's wrong?

848
01:45:51,941 --> 01:45:53,381
Are you playing with your boyfriend?

849
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:54,900
That's right.

850
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:00,440
You've got a great inspiration.

851
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,080
You can't be a G4 designer.

852
01:46:13,570 --> 01:46:15,331
Are you satisfied with
an ordinary designer?

853
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:21,080
That's right.

854
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:24,780
You can't be a G4 designer.

855
01:46:24,781 --> 01:46:25,040
That's right.

856
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:26,041
What's wrong?

857
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,880
Are you okay?

858
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:33,960
That's right.

859
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:38,290
Kawakita worked at my company as an intern.

860
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:40,640
He left a great record.

861
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:44,290
I want you to work at my company.

862
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:48,570
Really?

863
01:49:49,590 --> 01:50:01,290
In return, If you make everyone
here feel better, it's decided.

864
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:06,990
That's the condition.

865
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:11,370
What's wrong?

866
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:15,390
You admire Yamada, don't you?

867
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:17,450
What are you talking about?

868
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:23,590
This is what it's like to be in society.

869
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:25,770
That's right.

870
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:30,370
It's necessary to master art.

871
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,890
It's a must-have.

872
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,280
Please do your best.

873
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:41,030
That's right.

874
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:44,350
Let's get started.

875
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:46,110
That's right.

876
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:11,410
There's another one up there.

877
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,621
There's another one up there.

878
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,230
That's right.

879
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,700
You have a great body.

880
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,040
It's artistic.

881
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:44,100
This hip line is amazing.

882
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,620
That's right.

883
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:50,520
It's artistic.

884
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:55,460
Your body is artistic.

885
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:03,921
I'm sure you'll be a first-class designer.

886
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:14,400
You have a great hip line.

887
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:26,480
You have a great hip line.

888
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,760
You have a great body.

889
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:41,200
I want you to be
immersed in the world of art.

890
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:44,720
This is art.

891
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:03,120
You have a great hip line.

892
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,080
Mr. Kawakita.

893
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:08,000
That's right.

894
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,560
You have a great body.

895
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:13,120
That's right.

896
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:25,370
You have a great hip line.

897
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,790
That's right.

898
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:40,080
That's right.

899
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:41,160
That's right.

900
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,480
That's not all you're good at.

901
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:49,720
You have a hidden talent.

902
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,580
Look.

903
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:05,500
This is great.

01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,720
You have a great body.

01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:12,320
You have a great body.

01:54:16,065 --> 01:54:20,560
You have a great body.

907
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:32,130
That's right.

908
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,820
That's right.

909
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:35,390
Raise your chest.

910
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:39,430
That's an artistic curve.

911
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:42,170
That's right.

912
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:46,371
That's great, Mr. Kawakita.

913
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:49,020

914
01:54:50,325 --> 01:54:53,270
That's great.

915
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:09,470
Do whatever you want.

916
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:12,710
That's great.

917
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:21,450
That's great.

918
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,500

919
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:25,650
That's great.

920
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:32,350
You're so popular.

921
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,590
That's a great contrast.

922
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:37,510
That's great.

923
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:41,630
How does it taste today?

924
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:44,010
It's an artistic taste.

925
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:46,711
You haven't tasted it yet?

926
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:47,690
That's right.

927
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:48,970
I'll buy it for you.

928
01:55:49,850 --> 01:55:50,850
That's right.

929
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,401
That's great, Mr. Kawakita.

930
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:56,240
I'll buy it for you.

931
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:58,230
You have to show me a
lot of facial expressions.

932
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:01,150
That's great.

933
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:10,010
That's great.

934
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:18,130
The sweat and tears of
art are falling from here.

935
01:56:18,131 --> 01:56:20,091
The sweat and tears of
art are falling from here.

936
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:45,800
How do you feel?

937
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:52,900
I feel good.

938
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,400
That's right.

939
01:57:00,685 --> 01:57:02,000
That's great.

940
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:04,320
Look at me and sit down.

941
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:05,980
That's right.

942
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:07,840
That's right.

943
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,200
That's right.

944
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,240
Put your hands on your shoulders.

945
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:14,770
That's right.

946
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,920
Put your hands on your shoulders.

947
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,560
That's right.

948
01:57:20,561 --> 01:57:21,561
That's great.

949
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,560
That's great.

950
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:30,280
That's great.

951
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:41,920
That's great.

952
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:47,460
That's great.

953
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:54,520
That's great.

954
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:55,740
You feel good, don't you?

955
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:08,590
Look at me.

956
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:10,310
Don't worry.

957
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:12,670
Don't cry.

958
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:30,730
That's great.

959
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,910
You're getting better.

960
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:40,530
Please bully me more.

961
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,010
Say more.

962
01:58:43,830 --> 01:58:45,990
Please bully me more.

963
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:47,570
That's right.

964
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,041
I don't need this anymore.

965
01:58:51,355 --> 01:58:52,570
Come on, I'll show you.

966
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,070
That's right.

967
01:58:59,305 --> 01:59:00,450
What do you want me to do?

968
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:03,950
Look at me.

969
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,890
I'll show you.

970
01:59:05,891 --> 01:59:08,210
I'll take this off, too.

971
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:09,940
That's right.

972
01:59:11,490 --> 01:59:12,971
I'll show you everything beautifully.

973
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:14,800
I'll show you everything.

974
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,370
That's right.

975
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:19,070
You're beautiful.

976
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:31,850
You want me to bully you, don't you?

977
01:59:31,851 --> 01:59:36,870
Please look at me more.

978
01:59:37,195 --> 01:59:41,270
You want me to look at you, don't you?

979
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:48,720
That's a good reaction.

980
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:55,500
I feel good.

981
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,020
Do you feel good?

982
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:00,460
When you feel good, you get a lot of ideas.

983
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:06,900
Don't you?

984
02:00:06,901 --> 02:00:07,901
Don't cry.

985
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:10,460
Look at me.

986
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:16,500
You're beautiful.

987
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:21,100
You're so beautiful.

988
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:24,800
Your body is shining.

989
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:29,720
You're wonderful.

990
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:31,840
Look at me.

991
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
That's right.

992
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:45,220
You have a lot of ideas.

993
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:02,950
You're feeling better.

994
02:01:08,855 --> 02:01:10,150
That's right.

995
02:01:10,370 --> 02:01:11,370
That's right.

996
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:20,890
You still have a lot of ideas.

997
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:25,630
I feel good.

998
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:28,830
Don't cry.

999
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,420
Look at me.

1000
02:01:52,360 --> 02:02:00,360
Look at me.

1001
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:01,940
You're wonderful.

1002
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,400
You're wonderful.

1003
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:21,700
That's right.

1004
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:26,660
When I look at you, I
want to look at your back.

1005
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,900
You know what I mean, don't you?

1006
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,360
That's right.

1007
02:02:35,305 --> 02:02:36,380
Stand up.

1008
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:38,760
Put your hands here.

1009
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:40,600
Lift your hips.

1010
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,320
Can you see from below?

1011
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:47,780
Can you see what's going on?

1012
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,280
Can you see from below?

1013
02:02:57,380 --> 02:03:06,200
You're wonderful.

1014
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:12,640
You're getting better and better.

1015
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:33,770
You're getting better.

1016
02:03:34,810 --> 02:03:35,810
What's wrong with you?

1017
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:37,090
You have to tell me clearly.

1018
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:39,090
Do you feel good?

1019
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:40,830
I feel good.

1020
02:03:45,450 --> 02:03:46,870
Are you going to say this?

1021
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,890
You haven't put your fingers in yet.

1022
02:03:57,670 --> 02:03:58,670
You're wonderful.

1023
02:03:59,650 --> 02:04:01,910
It's great to see you standing up.

1024
02:04:01,911 --> 02:04:03,410
Don't cry.

1025
02:04:03,411 --> 02:04:04,771
You haven't put your hands in yet.

1026
02:04:09,345 --> 02:04:11,450
If you can't stand up, ask me for help.

1027
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:16,650
How do you feel?

1028
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:29,850
I feel good.

1029
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:30,970
What did you say?

1030
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:33,990
I feel good.

1031
02:04:33,991 --> 02:04:35,390
I feel good.

1032
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:37,910
This is good.

1033
02:04:41,755 --> 02:04:45,200
What's wrong with you?

1034
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:51,440
What's wrong with you?

1035
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:56,860
Give me a kiss.

1036
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,020
Do you want a kiss?

1037
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,960
That's a good way to do it.

1038
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:56,300
Give me a lot.

1039
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:06,120
That's not enough.

1040
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,360
There's a hand behind you.

1041
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:10,280
There's a hand behind you.

1042
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,600
Don't cry.

1043
02:07:17,601 --> 02:07:18,601
Don't cry.

1044
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:26,060
You're the best.

1045
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,820
Let me rub your butt.

1046
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:32,680
Slowly raise your butt.

1047
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,620
Stick it out.

1048
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:38,700
Stick it out more.

1049
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,120
You're the best.

1050
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:53,460
Do you feel good?

1051
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,980
I feel good.

1052
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:05,270
I'll do it slowly.

1053
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,020
Don't do that.

1054
02:08:13,021 --> 02:08:14,021
Don't do that.

1055
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:28,680
You're wonderful.

1056
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:35,120
I'm licking you.

1057
02:08:35,815 --> 02:08:39,140
Stick it in here.

1058
02:08:39,141 --> 02:08:40,880
That's good.

1059
02:08:40,881 --> 02:08:41,881
That's good, isn't it?

1060
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:53,510
There's a nasty sound
coming from over there.

1061
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,740
How do you feel?

1062
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:25,280
How do you feel?

1063
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:31,360
That's a good way to do it.

1064
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,540
Let me see your face.

1065
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:46,610
You're cold.

1066
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:48,380
You're cold.

1067
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:52,900
You feel good, don't you?

1068
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,620
I feel good.

1069
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:55,800
You feel good, don't you?

1070
02:10:19,785 --> 02:10:28,880
I feel good.

1071
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,520
I'll do it slowly.

1072
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:21,370
This is my art.

1073
02:11:23,395 --> 02:11:24,990
You're excellent.

1074
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:28,510
You can do it.

1075
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:30,210
You're amazing.

1076
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:32,070
You're amazing.

1077
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:33,710
This is my art.

1078
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:42,910
You can't stop.

1079
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:45,950
You're excellent.

1080
02:11:48,660 --> 02:12:11,290
I'll do it one more time.

1081
02:12:11,291 --> 02:12:12,291
You can do it.

1082
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,600
You can do it.

1083
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,740
This is my art.

1084
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,300
I'll do it one more time.

1085
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:46,600
You can do it.

1086
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:56,190
Don't stop.

1087
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:29,690
You can do it.

1088
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:43,940
I'm sorry.

1089
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:46,060
I'm sorry.

1090
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:48,600
I'll look at you from below.

1091
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:52,580
I'll look at you from below.

1092
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,350
You feel good, don't you?

1093
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:09,680
You feel good, don't you?

1094
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,040
How do you feel?

1095
02:14:15,010 --> 02:14:21,800
You feel good, don't you?

1096
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:26,860
That's good.

1097
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:30,860
You feel good, don't you?

1098
02:14:30,861 --> 02:14:46,050
Let me see your back.

1099
02:14:47,870 --> 02:15:09,330
I feel good.

1100
02:15:10,330 --> 02:15:12,630
I feel good.

1101
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:18,860
Please give me more.

1102
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:20,340
Please give me more.

1103
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:21,600
You can do it.

1104
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:27,680
That's a good voice.

1105
02:15:40,450 --> 02:15:41,450
I'll give you a lot more.

1106
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:47,630
I'll give you a lot more.

1107
02:15:47,631 --> 02:15:48,510
I'll give you a lot more.

1108
02:15:48,511 --> 02:15:49,511
How do you feel?

1109
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:00,700
You feel good, don't you?

1110
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:01,400
How do you feel?

1111
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:02,940
I feel good.

1112
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:04,560
Tell me you feel good.

1113
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,400
I feel good.

1114
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:15,400
Please give me more.

1115
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:16,960
Can I tell you?

1116
02:16:16,961 --> 02:16:17,961
You feel good, don't you?

1117
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,500
You feel good, don't you?

1118
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,540
I'll do it.

1119
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,860
You feel good, don't you?

1120
02:16:25,861 --> 02:16:26,861
I'll do it.

1121
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:45,760
You've had a lot of it.

1122
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:46,761
You've had a lot of it.

1123
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:49,140
You've had a lot of it.

1124
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,080
If you want a pacifier, go to the pacifier.

1125
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:55,700
Where is it?

1126
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:02,740
Please give me a pacifier.

1127
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:04,770
I'll make you feel better.

1128
02:17:28,650 --> 02:17:32,130
What are you doing?

1129
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:37,210
What are you doing?

1130
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:38,270
You have to talk.

1131
02:17:39,570 --> 02:17:40,730
What are you doing?

1132
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:42,590
I want you to put it in the pacifier.

1133
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:46,670
You put it in yourself, not the pacifier.

1134
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:48,700
You can do it again.

1135
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:22,430
You feel good, don't you?

1136
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:33,920
You feel good, don't you?

1137
02:18:33,921 --> 02:18:37,040
I feel good.

1138
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,520
You feel good, don't you?

1139
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:50,790
Can I give you a pacifier?

1140
02:18:51,050 --> 02:18:52,530
You feel good, don't you?

1141
02:18:55,010 --> 02:19:26,000
You feel good, don't you?

1142
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:36,520
You feel good, don't you?

1143
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:12,790
You feel good, don't you?

1144
02:20:12,791 --> 02:20:13,190
You feel good, don't you?

1145
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:24,700
You put it in yourself, not the pacifier.

1146
02:20:24,701 --> 02:20:29,520
You feel good, don't you?

1147
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:36,420
You feel good, don't you?

1148
02:20:36,421 --> 02:20:37,140
You feel good, don't you?

1149
02:20:37,215 --> 02:20:38,240
Your legs are moving.

1150
02:20:38,241 --> 02:20:39,960
Your legs are moving.

1151
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:42,360
I feel good.

1152
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:44,840
I feel good.

1153
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:47,920
You feel good, don't you?

1154
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:49,120
Your legs are moving.

1155
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,980
You feel good, don't you?

1156
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:56,640
The world of design is deep.

1157
02:20:56,641 --> 02:20:57,761
The world of design is deep.

1158
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:30,480
I feel good.

1159
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:39,640
You feel good, don't you?

1160
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:42,820
You have to talk louder.

1161
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:50,530
You feel good, don't you?

1162
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:52,270
I'll give you a pacifier.

1163
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:04,790
You feel good, don't you?

1164
02:22:06,010 --> 02:22:07,630
You feel good, don't you?

1165
02:22:07,631 --> 02:22:08,631
I'll give you a pacifier.

1166
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:34,720
Your tongue is drooping.

1167
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:43,380
You have to talk louder.

1168
02:22:45,270 --> 02:22:47,260
You have to talk louder.

1169
02:22:47,261 --> 02:22:56,880
You feel good, don't you?

1170
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,900
Your eyes are changing.

1171
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:09,620
You feel good, don't you?

1172
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:33,610
You're drooping.

1173
02:23:33,611 --> 02:23:36,410
You feel good, don't you?

1174
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:42,550
I can't take it anymore.

1175
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:45,270
You can't take it anymore, can you?

1176
02:23:46,205 --> 02:23:49,980
You can feel more.

1177
02:23:57,070 --> 02:23:58,930
You have to expose yourself more.

1178
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:04,240
You have to expose yourself more, Kawakita.

1179
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:08,100
The design is the same.

1180
02:24:08,101 --> 02:24:15,690
You feel good, don't you?

1181
02:24:15,691 --> 02:24:17,350
I'll put you in me.

1182
02:24:24,590 --> 02:24:41,210
You feel good, don't you?

1183
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:54,530
Look at me.

1184
02:24:56,300 --> 02:24:57,530
You're drooping.

1185
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:09,990
You feel good, don't you?

1186
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:45,140
I can't take it anymore.

1187
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:47,560
I'll put you in me.

1188
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:49,380
I'll put you in me.

1189
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:51,440
I'll put you in me.

1190
02:26:00,130 --> 02:26:01,710
I'll put you in me as a canvas.

1191
02:26:06,770 --> 02:26:09,550
This is art.

1192
02:26:32,580 --> 02:26:33,760
You're drooping.

1193
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:38,540
How do you feel?

1194
02:26:39,850 --> 02:26:41,280
You feel good, don't you?

1195
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:46,680
You feel good, don't you?

1196
02:26:56,770 --> 02:27:12,860

Isn't it Kawakita?
