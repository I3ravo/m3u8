1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,180
Did you get used to
work? No, not at all.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,220


3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,400
Suzuki-san just got mad at me.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
Really?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,560
Isn't she scary?

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,760
Well, a little bit.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,820
But you and her are like colleagues.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,520
Yes, we are.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,420
She's one year older than me.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,540
I see.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,900
She's really scary.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,440
I can't get used to her.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
I know.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,900
I've been told a lot.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,140
I think it's normal.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,340
I was the same when I quit my job.

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,500
Good morning.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,640
You're early.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
I came a little early.

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,320
Are you here alone?

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,420
No, I'm with Hiroko.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
You drank a lot yesterday, didn't you?

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,400
Did I? Yes, you did.

24
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:17,340
Did you see it? Yes, I did.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,480
Did you drink with
a man? No, I didn't.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,540
No, I didn't.

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,210


28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,766
Did you drink with a man
in the company? No, I didn't.

29
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,180
Yes, you did.

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,280
I didn't.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,300
No, I didn't.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,580


33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Really? I don't drink.

34
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,140


35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,520
But you drink quite a lot.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,220
I don't drink.

37
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,260
If you drink alcohol, you drink
a lot, don't you? I don't know.

38
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,580


39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,480
You drink a lot, don't
you? I drink a lot.

40
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020


41
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,980
You have a strong image.

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I drink a lot.

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,640
You were drunk yesterday.

44
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm not drunk at all.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,660
Really?

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,020
I'm not energetic at all.

47
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm so energetic that I
can drink from now on.

48
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,961
Isn't it dangerous to come to the office
in the middle of the day? Yes, it is.

49
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,390
That's right.

50
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,140
Last time, I was drunk
and I was about to be late.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,580
That's true.

52
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,640
I was scolded a lot.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,980
I was scared.

54
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,051
If it's the next time, I'll be late.

55
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,160
It's dangerous.

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,940
I was so scared that I couldn't get out.

57
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,080
I felt so quiet.

58
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,820
What? You were not quiet at all.

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,440
I was so nervous that I
couldn't answer the phone.

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
I see.

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,336
I was so nervous that I
couldn't answer the phone.

62
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,340
I know.
I was nervous when I had my first year.

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,320
Well, I guess the first year is like zero.

64
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,220
Yeah, we don't want to be on TV.

65
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,420
You know about the
crane last time, don't you?

66
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,740
What? Yes, I know.

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,660


68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,240
I saw a crane and made a lot of tea.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,380
What? That's amazing.

70
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,390
I drank a lot.

71
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
That's amazing.

72
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,200
I was so tired that day.

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,080
That's right.

74
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
That's why you drank again.

75
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
That's right.

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
I said I couldn't do it.

77
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
That's amazing.

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Don't you get drunk?

79
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,280
I get drunk sometimes, but
I don't get drunk on Fridays.

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,160
I see.

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,040
I don't get drunk on the next day's work.

82
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
I don't get drunk.

83
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,120
I don't get drunk.

84
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:38,800
I don't get drunk.

85
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,591
I don't get drunk on the next day's work.

86
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Maybe.

87
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,900
Is that so?

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
It's early in the morning.

89
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Yes.

90
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,340
I drank too much and gained weight.

91
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Really?

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Isn't it bad? I don't know.

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Don't worry.

94
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780


95
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm a little worried.

96
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Really?

97
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:23,110
You wear a uniform every day, so you
know how much you've gained, don't you?

98
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,050
That's the scariest thing.

99
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,340
I don't know what this means.

100
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,061
The cameraman makes choices
because you are very sensitive.

101
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,690
What a good boy!

102
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,810
But I had never imagined such a situation.

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
You are smart.

104
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,950
You may have a sit here.

105
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,650
It tickles me when you lean on my belly.

106
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,250
Do you sleep now? Wait a minute.

107
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,231
I don't think so.

108
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,210
I don't think so.

109
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,570
Are you OK?

110
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,990
I'm going to be scolded
if I don't do it properly.

111
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,650
Are you OK?

112
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,590
Are you OK? But, you know.

113
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,450
..

114
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:15,911
But, you know... What?

115
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,350
You two are different.

116
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,670
What?

117
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,510
Are you OK?

118
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:20,890
Are you OK?

119
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,410
Are you OK? Thank you.

120
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,670
But, you know.

121
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,570
..

122
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:24,230
But, you know... Are you OK?

123
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:24,810
Are you OK?

124
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,130
〔Laughing〕

125
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,900
〔Speaking Japanese〕

126
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:11,980
〔Speaking Japanese〕

127
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,600
Everyone, that's all for today.

128
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,406
Thanks to everyone's
hard work, our club achieved

129
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:25,580
the first place in sales
in the previous season.

130
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:34,720
Today, as a celebration of the win, we
will have a meeting in the break room.

131
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,561
I'll do it, so please move from people
who have a good work atmosphere.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes, yes.

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,720
Let me finish my work early.

134
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,251
Please say that in advance.

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm counting on you.

136
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
It's a surprise.

137
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Thank you.

138
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:52,475
I bought a lot of things.

139
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
I bought a lot.

140
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
It looks so heavy.

141
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I recommend this.

142
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,140
It's the best.

143
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,940
Can I drink this? I'm sorry.

144
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:00,941


145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,280
We have beer, too.

146
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,851
What would you like to drink?

147
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
What should I do?

148
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,260
We have beer, too.

149
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,900
Thank you.

150
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,440
Please drink as much as you can.

151
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,680
Thank you.

152
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Don't drink too much.

153
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,870
No, no, no.

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,540
Thank you.

155
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:26,201
I'll take it off.

157
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Shimizu, too.

158
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,740
Please tie it up.

159
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
I don't need it.

161
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,120
I'd like a beer.

162
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll have a beer.

163
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,380
I'll have a beer.

164
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,880
Everyone, please take a seat.

165
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,740
Thank you.

166
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,021
I'll have a beer with my senior.

167
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
What?

168
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,360
That's too much.

169
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
One, two, three.

170
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:53,300
Thank you very much.

171
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm hungry.

172
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Do it yourself.

173
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
Thank you for your hard work.

174
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Thank you very much.

175
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
Cheers!

176
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Thank you very much.

177
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,760
Please prepare more snacks.

178
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,020
I bought a lot.

179
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
Cheese!

180
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:32,555
Thank you for the meal.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,800
Thank you for the meal.

182
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Is it leaking? It's important.

183
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,080


184
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Who bought this?

185
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
It smells so good.

186
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
It's me.

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,220
Then, it's your turn.

188
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,360
This is the first time I've ever
seen such a large amount of cheese.

189
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,420
It's a lot of cheese, isn't it?

190
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,960
I want to eat cheese.

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
How did you buy it?

192
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,700
I bought it in a pack.

193
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,656
I didn't know there was such a thing.

194
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,280
It's the first time I've ever seen
such a large amount of cheese.

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,740
I can't drink at all.

196
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,770
This is a gift for you.

197
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Oh, really? Thank you.

198
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,230
Thank you.

199
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,090
Thank you.

200
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,310
Thank you.

201
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:26,650
Thank you.

202
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:26,690
Thank you.

203
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,691
Thank you.

204
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,650


205
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,830
Is this all for
me? No, it's not.

206
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,970


207
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,190
Don't eat too much.

208
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,430
It's noisy.

209
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,770
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,900
Is that so?

211
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Can I have this?

212
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,480
What? I'm sorry.

213
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm sorry.

215
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820


216
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,260
It is the first time for us
to have a meeting like this.

217
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,341
We are so happy to be here.

218
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,400
We are so happy to be here.

219
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,600
We are so happy to be here.

220
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm sorry. It's not going to leak.

221
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,980
It may not leak.

222
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,720
Please hold it.

223
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,300
It's not going to leak.

224
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
It's not going to leak.

225
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,770
It was on the camera, wasn't it?

226
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,480
It was on the camera.

227
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,820
Your face is too red.

228
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,500
It's not good.

229
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,540
Oh, it's true.

230
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,560
What's wrong?

231
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
What's wrong? You look bad.

232
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,760
You look bad.

233
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140


234
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
I hit my forehead.

235
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,340
You hit your forehead.

236
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
It's hard to say that a girl is bad
at boys, isn't it? You're so cute.

237
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,680
You're so cute.

238
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,800
You're so cute.

239
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,200
You're so cute.

240
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:15,800
You're so cute.

241
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,880
You're so cute.

242
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,321
I'm getting sleepy.

243
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Oh, my God!

244
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
It's like a labyrinth.

245
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,940
I know.

246
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,540
Hello, Shizuka.

247
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Hi.

248
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Hi.

249
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,440
Hi.

250
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Are you drunk? A little.

251
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320


252
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Then, please drink.

253
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,340
You're getting red.

254
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm getting red, too.

255
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,280
No, you're not.

256
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,580
You're drunk, aren't
you? No, I'm not.

257
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,180
I don't know if I'm drunk.

258
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:42,640
I don't know if I'm drunk.

259
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
We're drinking together.

260
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Cheers!

261
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,380
Cheers!

262
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:47,381
Cheers!

263
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,496
We were the ones who took off the clothes.

264
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,936
They are the ones who are wearing it.

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
What's wrong? I'm sorry.

266
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620


267
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,940
We'll do our best.

268
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,500
I'm fine.

269
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Is it leaking?

270
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,300
Don't worry about it.

271
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,690
You're so cute.

272
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
It's noisy.

273
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,320
If you take it from the top, it will leak.

274
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:13,400
I was taught how to do it.

275
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,560
It's so cute.

276
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
It's heavy.

277
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,780
It's like a boy's belly button.

278
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,740
My face is so heavy.

279
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
What are you talking
about? It's so heavy.

280
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600


281
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,940
You've been taking
care of your beauty lately.

282
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
Really?

283
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Do you have a
boyfriend? No, I don't.

284
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640


285
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,400
What?

286
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,900
You don't have a
boyfriend? I don't.

287
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360


288
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,120
You told me something today, didn't you?

289
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,300
What? I don't know.

290
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720


291
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,300
Mion-chan told me something.

292
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,480
Did she? Tell me.

293
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,060
I'll tell you.

294
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,400
It's a secret.

295
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:55,401
Don't say that.

296
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,000
We are a team.

297
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,180
We are friends.

298
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
It's a secret.

299
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Senpai is more.

300
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,040
..

301
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:07,560
than I thought.

302
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Really?

303
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,080
Don't make fun of me!

304
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,040
I'm going to put it in my mouth.

305
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,220
Are you going to put it in
your mouth? Yes, please.

306
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480


307
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,040
It's spinning, isn't it?

308
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,060
It's spinning,
isn't it? I'm scared.

309
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,061


310
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Why?

311
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Isn't it too early?

312
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Isn't it too early?
I don't know.

313
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,040
I don't know.

315
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,900
I don't know.

316
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,560
I don't know.

317
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm not good at it.

318
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,220
I'm not good at it.

319
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,760
I'm not good at it.

320
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Senpai, are you drinking?

321
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm drinking a lot.

322
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,380
Really?

323
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
I gave you three bottles.

324
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
Really? I'm losing.

325
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000


326
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,700
Don't say such a lonely thing.

327
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm lonely.

328
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,180
Are you drinking?

329
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Yes, I'm drinking.

330
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
You don't drink, do you?

331
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,600
I like to put cream on when I drink.

332
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,060
What is it?

333
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,061
I don't want to do it.

334
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,800
I don't want to do it.

335
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,080
I don't want to do it.

336
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I don't want to do it.

337
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,010
I don't want to do it.

338
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't want to do it.

339
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:22,740
I don't want to do it.

340
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,880
I don't want to do it.

341
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't want to do it.

342
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,240
I don't want to do it.

343
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:30,300
I don't want to do it.

344
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,860
I don't want to do it.

345
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:30,900
I don't want to do it.

346
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:30,980
I don't want to do it.

347
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,200
Take a cute picture of him.

348
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I'm going to bed.

349
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,620
I'm going to bed.

350
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm going to bed.

351
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,420
Thank you for your hard work.

352
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,140
Thank you for your hard work.

353
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,300
Your face is red, so be careful.

354
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,980
Thank you for your hard work.

355
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Are you okay?

356
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,740
Are you okay? I'm sleepy.

357
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm sleepy.

358
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460


359
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,900
What's wrong?

360
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,300
What's wrong, Tsuki?

361
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
What's wrong? Your eyes.

362
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,640


363
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
Your eyes are scary.

364
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Your eyes are scary.

365
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,480
What's wrong? Oh, no.

366
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,040


367
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,620
I have a psychopathic eye.

368
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,580
Help me.

369
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:17,581
Psychopathic eye.

370
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
It's not a big deal.

371
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
It's not a big deal.

372
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
Oh, no.

373
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,780
What should I do with this guy?

374
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,060
Don't flirt with him.

375
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,000
What?

376
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
What?

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,460
You have a bad memory.

378
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,740
It's normal, isn't
it? It's normal.

379
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300


380
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,820
It's not normal.

381
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You have a bad memory.

382
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,020
You have a bad heart.

383
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,220
No, I don't.

384
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
I don't touch my seniors.

385
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,360
You have a kind heart.

386
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,720
You were doing like this.

387
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,770
You were fighting back and forth.

388
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,440
Who do you like the
most? Ayase-chan.

389
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,941
Oh! Wait a minute.

390
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Don't go there.

391
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,120
I thought so.

392
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,060
I thought so.

393
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,380


394
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
What's wrong? Cute.

395
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040


396
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,430
You guys are not good.

397
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,580
Everyone is cute.

398
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,330
Three cute girls of the same age.

399
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,820
No.1, No.2, No.3.

400
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
It's not in order.

401
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,700
No.1, No.2, No.3.

402
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,220
It's the second year.

403
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:42,221
It's a mistake.

404
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Shun, are you
sleeping? No, I'm not.

405
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,100
Wake up.

406
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,101


407
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK.

408
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,441
Your wife will be angry.

409
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
I'm alive.

410
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
I'm alive.

411
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,860
Shun, you can go home soon.

412
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,340
You must be tired.

413
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,820
Please take a rest at home.

414
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Thank you for the food.

415
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Are you going home?

416
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,020
Really?

417
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,021
You're going home?

418
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,280
She's so eager to eat.

419
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Thank you for the food.

420
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,490
Sorry, guys.

421
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Thank you for the food.

422
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Nice to see you.

423
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,540
You're still drinking, aren't you?

424
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,020
He's not drinking at all.

425
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,860
He's drinking a lot.

426
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,660
You're not good at it, are you?

427
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,520
I don't know how to do it.

428
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,160
I don't know how to do it.

429
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,340
I don't know how to do it.

430
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:55,960
I don't know how to do it.

431
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
I don't know how to do it.

432
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,980
I don't know how to do it.

433
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,800
I don't know how to do it.

434
00:17:59,801 --> 00:17:59,860
I don't know how to do it.

435
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,220
It's totally different.

436
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,370
It's totally different.

437
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,730
What are you doing?

438
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,350
There are girls, too.

439
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,850
Everyone likes my T-shirt.

440
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,350
No, no, no.

441
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,950
Don't get close to the table.

442
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:26,951
Don't do that.

443
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,310
Oh my god.

444
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,490
I'm doing it.

445
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,230
That's not good.

446
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,790
Look at your body.

447
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,510
Don't trick me.

448
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,030
What do you think of this body?

449
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,031
What do you
think of it? It's cute.

450
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,270
It's cute.

451
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,590


452
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,170
Senpai, please touch it.

453
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,650
You can touch it.

454
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,810
You can touch it.

455
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,210
It's amazing.

456
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,310
Senpai, what do you think of it?

457
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,370
Well, it's not bad.

458
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,550
But it's not crooked, so it's okay.

459
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
If you put it in a normal
way, it's about this.

460
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,090
Stand up. Stand up.

461
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:19,870
Take it off. Take it off.

462
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:20,871
Hey, ladies.

463
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,930
Are you okay? I'm fine.

464
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,510


465
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,310
Can I look down?

466
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,070
I can't see anything.

467
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:30,071
I can't see anything.

468
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,790
I can't see anything.

469
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,610
It was bigger than I thought.

470
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,630
It was bigger than I thought.

471
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,150
Did we get along well?

472
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,130
Did we get along
well? Sometimes.

473
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,830
Sometimes.

474
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,490
Sometimes.

475
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:42,491


476
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,490
Is it a little
hot? No, it's not.

477
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,530
It's a chair.

478
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:48,430
A chair.

479
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,431


480
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,710
It looks comfortable to sit on.

481
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,090
You're going to sit on it.

482
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,450
You're going to sit on it.

483
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,451
How do you feel? I'm sweating.

484
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,510


485
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,150
That's because you're working.

486
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,770
It's hot.

487
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I can see a triangle.

488
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,810
A triangle?

489
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,390
What is it? I can see it.

490
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,050
I'm a pervert.

491
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,250


492
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,570
I'm also a pervert.

493
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,090
How long are you going to be a pervert?

494
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,830
You really like it, don't you?

495
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,730
But your eyes were fixed all the time.

496
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,930
Do you like that
kind of thing? I hate it.

497
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,650
I hate it.

498
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,270
You hate it, don't
you? I hate it.

499
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:31,710
I hate it.

500
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,070
I hate it.

501
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,810
I hate it.

502
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:33,170
I hate it.

503
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,770


504
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,010
This is the first time in a
year that I drink a lot of alcohol.

505
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,010
You drink a lot of high-calorie
alcohol, don't you? Yes, I do.

506
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,830
Drink more.

507
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,831
It's good.

508
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,390


509
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,830
You became a woman again.

510
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,470
Ayase, you can't drink alcohol.

511
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,510
Is it good?

512
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,630
Do you drink beer? No, I can't.

513
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:04,771
Don't you drink highball?

514
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,830
I don't drink at all.

515
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,350
I don't drink.

516
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,930
I don't drink.

517
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,690
There is.

518
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,310
I think the first place this time is because
of the hard work of the young people.

519
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,130
Thank you very much.

520
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,650
I'm really happy.

521
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,125
I see.

522
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,730
This kind of success
experience is very important.

523
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,870
I think I got the first place.

524
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,410
I want you to do your best from now on.

525
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
Yes, I'll do my best.

526
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,790
I'll buy it.

527
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,510
Thank you very much.

528
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,550
Then I have to go home soon.

529
00:21:46,325 --> 00:22:00,809
I can't do it

530
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,530
I should have been the one to get it.

531
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,490
Oh, you're right.

532
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,086
I should have been the one to get it.

533
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,890
I can't buy it anymore.

534
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,026
I've been listening to what
you've been talking about.

535
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,430
Koba has been holding your hand.

536
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,310
I can't say I'm going to buy it.

537
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,550
You're too much.

538
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,970
By the way, Hoshinaga-san.

539
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,090
What is it? Show me.

540
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,210


541
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,350
What's wrong? I'm scared.

542
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,890
What's going on?

543
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,370
Don't say that to Senpai.

544
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,930
I'll show you my boobs.

545
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
Show me.

546
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,790
I have proof.

547
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,490
Will you show me if I take off my pants?

548
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,110
I'll take off my pants.

549
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,150
Seriously, stop it.

550
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,450
Seriously, your
life is... Stop it.

551
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,210
It's dangerous.

552
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,690
It's Sekuhara's turn.

553
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,810
Go, go, go!

554
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,730
Stop it! Shinokawa-san.

555
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,710
I saw it.

556
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,350


557
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,210
Shinokawa-san, show me your boobs.

558
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,150
I told you I was the scariest.

559
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,430
I told you I don't need it.

560
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,130
That's right.

561
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,030
You're cheating.

562
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,510
You're cheating.

563
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,390
Show it to her.

564
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,350
Can I?

565
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,350
I don't need it.

566
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,170
Do you want to see it up close?

567
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,390
No, I don't want to.

568
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,150
I'm so surprised.

569
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,190
Show me your boobs.

570
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,470
To be honest,

571
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,390
not only Kobayashi-kun,

572
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,710
It's not just me.

573
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,630
What are you talking about?

574
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,890
My boobs are not equal.

575
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,490
They are.

576
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,710
They are not equal.

577
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,450
They are not equal.

578
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,930
What's that face?

579
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,910
What's that face? It's Tsume.

580
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:20,210


581
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:22,370
Kobayashi-kun, Tsume.

582
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,150
Is it that one?

583
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,550
Isn't it?

584
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,330
It's this one, right? No, no.

585
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:38,810
If other men also take off their
masks, I think I can show it to them.

586
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,410
I don't want to be a mouth yet.

587
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,190
She is excited.

588
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,390
I don't want to be a rabbit.

589
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,250
Is it my fault?

590
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,310
Hoshigaka-senpai said so.

591
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,150
Oh, he took it off.

592
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,390
Kobayashi-san, please give me some money.

593
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,410
Are you sure?

594
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,430
Can you pay for it, Hoshirama-san?

595
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:02,395
If it's my senior, I don't mind.

596
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,570
Oh, no.

597
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,770
Oh, no, no, no, no.

598
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,130
Oh, really?

599
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,150
He said he would show it to me if he could.

600
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,570
Oh, no.

601
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,270
Oh, no.

602
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,490
Oh, no.

603
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:19,610
Here it is.

604
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,330
Wow! It's big.

605
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,190
It's not big.

606
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,270
It's normal.

607
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,470


608
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,830
It doesn't stand up.

609
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,110
Look at this.

610
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:28,790
Wow!

611
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,290
Is this OK? Wow! Two more.

612
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,510


613
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,670


614
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,910
Two more? Two more.

615
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,570


616
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,190
I'm taking a video with great effort.

617
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,550
Oh, no.

618
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,930
It looks fun.

619
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,170
How do you feel?

620
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,730
How do you feel?

621
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,670
What do you think? I don't know.

622
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,270


623
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,690
Don't show it to the camera.

624
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,670
Can I close it now?

625
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,830
Can I close it now?

626
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:03,310
Can I close it now?

627
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,910
You look like a senpai.

628
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,290
You look like a senpai.

629
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,350
You look like a senpai.

630
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,750
Why can't you see it?

631
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,310
It's fine even if you cover your eyes.

632
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,310
Why do you take it off?

633
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,050
3 vs 1

634
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:29,690
3 vs 1

635
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,590
3 vs 1

636
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,470
Take it off! Take it off!

637
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,810
Take it off! Take it off!

638
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,090
Take it off! Take it off!

639
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,370
What? Really?

640
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,110
Are you going to take it off?

641
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:41,890
Shall I start?

642
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,970
Let's do it properly.

643
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,850
Huh?

644
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,150
Please take it off quickly.

645
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,570
Is it big? The smallest.

646
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,490
..

647
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,910
Hurry up!

648
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,090
No, I can't see!

649
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:06,550
You took it off at once.

650
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:07,551
It's rare.

651
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,690
It's rare.

652
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,070
There is nothing scary in the world.

653
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,330
There is nothing.

654
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,850
Do you want to be a chinchin model?

655
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,970
Do you want to stand up?

656
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,210
Aya-san will follow me.

657
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,710
Do you want to stand up?

658
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,650
Do you want to stand up?

659
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,190
I can't stand up.

660
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,250
I can't stand up.

661
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,070
Let's take a walk.

662
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,990
Let's take a walk.

663
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,490
Let's take a walk.

664
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,491
Oh!

665
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,210
This is a video of Seiko.

666
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,530
Yes, it is.

667
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,490
It's so funny.

668
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,850
Look at this.

669
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,166
This picture is absolutely funny.

670
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,470
Look at this.

671
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,190
What?

672
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,100
Look at this picture. Isn't
it funny? It's too funny.

673
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,310


674
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,830
What are you
hiding? It's so funny.

675
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,630


676
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,830
You are too proud.

677
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,970
How do you feel?

678
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,650
I didn't take off my clothes.

679
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,750
Do you want to show your boobs?

680
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,350
How do you feel?

681
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,610
It's a close-up camera.

682
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,110
How do you feel?

683
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,330
The person on the far right is hiding it.

684
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,330
Please don't hide it.

685
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,210
Please roll up your sleeves.

686
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,331
Please take off your clothes,
so that we can see you.

687
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,150
Can you see me?

688
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:33,671
You are standing a little bit, Senpai.

689
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Can I take off my top?

690
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,210
What?

691
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,550
It's embarrassing.

692
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,750
You said you would show your
boobs if you show your boobs.

693
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,590
You said you would show your
boobs if you show your boobs.

694
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,591
You are stupid.

695
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,810
Show me your boobs.

696
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,110
I can't help it.

697
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,730
Are you serious, Senpai?

698
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,270
Are you serious, Senpai?

699
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:56,270
Well, if you take it off
for four people like this...

700
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,970
Are you serious? Here you are.

701
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,110


702
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,270
Why are you going to the middle?

703
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,350
Are you serious?

704
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,806
It's amazing that you're
sleeping in such a cold.

705
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,450
It's so tight.

706
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,730
Are you serious?

707
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,450
What should I do?

708
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,870
Really?

709
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:19,871
Wait, wait, wait.

710
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,490
It's so funny.

711
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,310
I'm taking a video.

712
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,250
But you're watching us, aren't you?

713
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,950
You're curious about Aya-san, aren't you?

714
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,190
I'm curious, aren't I?

715
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,610
But it's a locker
room, isn't it? I see.

716
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,950
It's quite big.

717
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,230
It's not big.

718
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,810


719
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,230
So, the result is... Let's see.

720
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,231
Hey, what do you think?

721
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,710
What do you think?

722
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,150
She's asking for your name.

723
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,570
What do you think?

724
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,990
Well, she's got some bra.

725
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,250
Oh, really? Of course.

726
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,630


727
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,930
Tell me where you're
going to buy it next time.

728
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,590
I'm going to take it off.

729
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,150
No way.

730
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:05,170
I'm going to take it off.

731
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:05,690
No way.

732
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,170
I'm going to give it to Chaki.

733
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,510
Wait.

734
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,570
I didn't think you'd really take it off.

735
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:11,810
Really?

736
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,910
If everyone takes it off, it's a mistake.

737
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,630
I'm going to show you.

738
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,670
I told you, so I can't help it.

739
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,070
You are cool.

740
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,250
You are cool.

741
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,110
I showed it to my juniors.

742
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
The bra is cute.

743
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,310
The bra is cute.

744
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,390
The bra is cute.

745
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,670
Cute.

746
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,550
I'll take a picture.

747
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,810
I'll take a picture.

748
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,830
How is it?

749
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,950
Is this a breast?

750
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,770
Is this a bra?

751
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,130
This is a breast.

752
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,131
These are boobs.

753
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,170
What do you mean, Kobayashi?

754
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,580
I mean I don't have boobs.

755
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,190
I see.

756
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,650
You have a lot of boobs.

757
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,490
Really?

758
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,070
I think they are big.

759
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,630
I'm glad.

760
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,070
Let's compare which one is bigger.

761
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,750
Hey, stop it.

762
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,690
I don't like it.

763
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,090
You are so gross, Kobayashi.

764
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,406
You have a size B,
don't you? Yes, I do.

765
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,790


766
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,226
You have a size B,
don't you? Yes, I do.

767
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:06,530


768
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,886
You have a size B, don't you?

769
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,690
What are you talking
about? Oh, she's gone.

770
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:09,910


771
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,350
I won't take it off.

772
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,050
You're in a bad position now.

773
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,730
Everyone is taking it off.

774
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,421
Why don't you take it off by yourself?

775
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,346
You can't help it because
you're sleeping alone.

776
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,330
It's not good to try to run away in
front of the camera when you're awake.

777
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,770
I'm a cameraman.

778
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,750
Come here.

779
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:41,610
I don't know.
I don't know what's going to happen.

780
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,030
Why? Why? Do your best.

781
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,570


782
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,750
Me too?

783
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
I want to see Ayase-san.

784
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,930
Tsukki and Sajima are involved.
I'm involved, too.

785
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,030
Everyone is involved.

786
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,150
Everyone is involved.

787
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:02,250
It's been a while since the
two of you touched each other.

788
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,546
It's been a while since the
two of you touched each other.

789
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,810
It's been a while since the
two of you touched each other.

790
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:10,990
I think it's better to take it off.

791
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,670
I think it's better to take it off.

792
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,750
It's because everyone took it off.

793
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,110
Please take it off.

794
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:22,385
Are you sure? I can't say it.

795
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,810


796
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,090
Really?

797
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,670
I can't say it, senpai.

798
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,370
Then, I'll do it.

799
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,570
Isn't this picture bad?

800
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,210
Is it bad?

801
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,690
Is it bad?

802
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,850
The picture is bad.

803
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,190
The picture is bad, but... What
are you doing surrounded by a bed?

804
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,910
Yume-chan is sleeping all the time.

805
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,930
Yume-chan is cheating.

806
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,030
Can you show me something sexy?

807
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,570
What is that?

808
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:49,210
What's that?

809
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,490
I don't know what to do.

810
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,170
What do you mean? I don't know.

811
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,930
It's difficult.

812
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,330


813
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,530
I don't know what to do.

814
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,150
Senpai, did you say
something? Oh, no.

815
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,490
Oh, no? Oh, no.

816
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,070
I didn't know.

817
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,710
What? Senpai.

818
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:06,870


819
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,270
..

820
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,670
What? What?
What? I heard rumors.

821
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,250


822
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,270
What?

823
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,730
Did you hear rumors?
I heard rumors.

824
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,310


825
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,470
What?

826
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,750
What? What? What? What?

827
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,410
What? Senpai is erotic.

828
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,630
Senpai is erotic?

829
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,850
Senpai is erotic?

830
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,850
Senpai is erotic?

831
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,850
What's that simple question?

832
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,810
I said it earlier.

833
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,150
I said it earlier.

834
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,390
Senpai is erotic?

835
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,910
What's that?

836
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,270
I said it earlier.

837
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:37,410
I said it earlier.

838
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:41,110
It's cute.

839
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,990
Tsukimura is behind you.

840
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,750
I'm shy, Senpai.

841
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,230
I'm shy, Senpai.

842
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,170
By the way, I'm shooting like this now.

843
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,670
It's so cute.

844
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,670
It's so cute.

845
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,010
It's so big.

846
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:04,930
It's so big.

847
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,090
Do I take it off?

848
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,070
Do I take it off?

849
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,226
I don't know how to take off my braids.
How should I take it off?

850
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,910
Like this?

851
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,970
I don't know how to do it.

852
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,810
Hey, it's not like that.

853
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:22,930
I'm sorry.

854
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,770
Why are you so nervous?

855
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,550
Because everyone took off their braids.

856
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:33,610
So, are you going to go
home after sharing your secret?

857
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,946
Are you satisfied,
Kobayashi-kun? Not yet.

858
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:37,470


859
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,650
Not yet?

860
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,290
What do you want to do?

861
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,391
What's wrong with you, Kobayashi?

862
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,890
You're crazy, Kobayashi.

863
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,310
You're crazy.

864
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,270
You're more crazy than before.

865
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,930
Really?

866
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:48,770
What? You're crazy.

867
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,010


868
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
You're doing it.

869
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,970
You can't just sleep, can you?

870
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,430
I have to wake her up.

871
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,770
What?

872
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,690
It's like a prank.

873
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:00,810
A prank?

874
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,230
What kind of prank?

875
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,970
It's going to be like I'm the suspect.

876
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,370
What?

877
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,371
I'm the suspect.

878
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,590
What are you going to do? Well.

879
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,870
..

880
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,110
There are men around me.

881
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,030
Surround me.

882
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,750
Surround you?

883
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,751
What do you mean? I'll hold you.

884
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,430


885
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,890
What's going on?

886
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:30,350
When I woke up, I was surprised that
there were so many people around me.

887
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,050
Wow, you look like you're
going to have a trauma.

888
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,490
It's a prank.

889
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,550
Two, three, four? Four.

890
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,050


891
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,030
You're thinking about something crazy.

892
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,150
Because I took it off.

893
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,970
Show me again.

894
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,110
Can you see it? It's cute.

895
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,150


896
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,430
Where are you going?

897
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,110
It's not a make-up.

898
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,030
I see.

899
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,490
What should I do?

900
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,030
This is amazing.

901
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,510
Chikorin.

902
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,070
How should I wake
her up? Wake her up.

903
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,530
Wake up.

904
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,190
Wake up.

905
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,850
Wake up.

906
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,050
She is standing.

907
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,830
She is so excited.

908
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,970
I'm going home.

909
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,710
I saw her.

910
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,990
What's up?

911
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:24,510
Is there someone in there?

912
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,050
That's what happened.

913
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,030
What's up, Yume-chan?

914
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,850
Wait a minute, Kobayashi.
Don't rub your head.

915
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,530
Everyone is taking off their clothes.

916
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,870
What?

917
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,870
Are you happy,
Yume-chan? I'm happy.

918
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,130


919
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,950
Are you happy?

920
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,930
Why? Why are you taking it off?

921
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,870
It's blubbering.

922
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,750
Oh, no.

923
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,530
It's embarrassing.

924
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,690
You're happy, aren't you?

925
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,250
Do you want to take it off, too?

926
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,110
Which one looks the best?

927
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,110
I'd like to hear that.

928
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,150
What do you think?

929
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,670
The one you like.

930
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,470
Let's line up.

931
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,270
What's that?

932
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,210
Are you OK?

933
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,770
Are you OK?

934
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,070
Are you OK?

935
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,710
Please come here.

936
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,430
You can put it on your left and right.

937
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,950
What do you mean?

938
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,450
You can choose your favorite person.

939
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,310
Why did you go to that side?

940
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,810
It's easy to see.

941
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,830
Senpai, you are the most
popular one, aren't you? Yes, I am.

942
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,970


943
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,450
Oh my god!

944
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,630
What?

945
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,070
It's really chaos.

946
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,161
What are you doing in the company?

947
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,550
What should I do?

948
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,330
Do you choose Senpai? Yes, I do.

949
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,150


950
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,070
What? Yes, I do.

951
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,690
It's so long.

952
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,310


953
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,070
What should I do?

954
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:05,071
Please choose one.

955
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,510
What should I do?

956
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,670
Please study one by one.

957
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,990
I'm doing close-up camera.

958
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:09,890
Thank you.

959
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:13,970
If you don't leave it in the document,
everyone's health... I'll delete it.

960
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,090
No, no, no.

961
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,130
Progress report?

962
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,830
Progress report.

963
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,430
Progress report.

964
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:18,790
It's important.

965
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,486
What should I do with this?
Should I stand up? Yeah, stand up.

966
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,510


967
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,530
Then I'll stand in front.

968
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,770
Do you know the
distance? I know.

969
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,970


970
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,810
What should I do?

971
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,990
By the way, why are you like
this all the time? Oh, my God.

972
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,970


973
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,330
What should I do?

974
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:48,990
Today's lucky item is this!

975
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,210
What's the reason?

976
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,570
The reason is the perfect length.

977
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,470
Is length important?

978
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,490
The perfect thickness and length.

979
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,710
Do you like the length?

980
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:05,750
What is it?

981
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,910
It looks good, doesn't it?

982
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,490
And this golden egg is small and cute.

983
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,550
What are you talking about?

984
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,310
It's cute, isn't it?

985
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,090
What's wrong?

986
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,290
Senpai, what?

987
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,590
Can I touch it? Touch it.

988
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,310


989
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:22,850
No.

990
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,470
Why?

991
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,910
You've been talking about a lot of guys.

992
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,050
That's right.

993
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,410
There were a lot of guys.

994
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,430
Originally.

995
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:34,431
It's original.

996
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,570
What? Why? Senpai, please.

997
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,110


998
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,670
What's wrong?

999
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,110
Is it bad? I can't do it.

1000
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,350


1001
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,970
Someone, please touch it.

1002
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,790
No, no, no.

1003
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,850
Please touch it.

1004
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,150
Senpai, Senpai, Senpai.

1005
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,870
I'm going to be the one
who makes you have sex.

1006
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,410
What?

1007
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,610
Wait, Kobayashi-kun,
what's that hand? I hate it.

1008
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,731
Let me change my clothes.

1009
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,650
I'm doing it over there.

1010
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,070
I was nervous.

1011
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,580
Do you want me to lick you?

1012
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,730
What's wrong? Please lick me.

1013
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,130


1014
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,150
I'm watching you.

1015
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,070
What?

1016
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,650
What?

1017
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,970
Why?

1018
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,310
Why?

1019
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,710
She is licking your hand.

1020
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,410
She is licking my hand.

1021
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,610
She is taking a photo.

1022
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,030
How do I look?

1023
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,910
You look comfortable.

1024
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,770
I feel good.

1025
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,670
Do you feel good? Really? Wait.

1026
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,950


1027
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,950


1028
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,070
Don't take a photo.

1029
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,890
Don't take it off.

1030
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,190
Don't take it off.

1031
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,810
It's hot.

1032
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,010
It's cute.

1033
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,630
What are you doing, Senpai?

1034
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:04,790
Which Senpai? Pera.

1035
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,910


1036
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,970
Hoshinaka Senpai.

1037
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,230
Pera.

1038
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,330
I saw it.

1039
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,550
It's dangerous.

1040
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,070
Pera.

1041
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,350
Shimo-san, do Pera.

1042
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,070
Can I?

1043
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:21,270
It's so beautiful.

1044
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,510
I can't see it.

1045
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,330
Wow! It's beautiful.

1046
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,020


1047
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,190
It's so beautiful.

1048
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,290
It's beautiful.

1049
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,326
Senpai, it's so beautiful.

1050
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,350
It's soft.

1051
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,550
It's beautiful. It's cute.

1052
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,890
What is it?

1053
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,150
What is it?

1054
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,110
Both of you have boobies.

1055
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,790
It's showing.

1056
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,410
It's showing.

1057
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,710
Yume-chan, why don't you take it off?

1058
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,570
Why don't you take
it off? Take it off.

1059
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,830


1060
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,230
Take it off?

1061
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,870
Senpai, you keep touching it.

1062
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,210
What? Wait a minute.

1063
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:02,970
There are two.

1064
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,630
I took it off.

1065
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,490
What?

1066
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,730
What?

1067
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,830
Shizuya is rubbing it.

1068
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,310
Rubbing? That's bad.

1069
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,590
Wait a minute.

1070
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,190
It's been 5 minutes.

1071
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,230
5 minutes? Look at me.

1072
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,290


1073
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,130
I'm embarrassed.

1074
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,050
It's fast.

1075
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,170
It's fast.

1076
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,750
I took it off.

1077
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
I took it off.

1078
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,070
I took it off.

1079
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,290
You have beautiful legs.

1080
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,330
He said I have beautiful legs.

1081
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,940
You are standing on tiptoe.

1082
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,530
I'm so jealous!

1083
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,450
I'm more jealous than
when I got my boobs out.

1084
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,930
Do you have a favorite among
the cute and beautiful ones?

1085
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,650
What?

1086
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,290
I like them the most.

1087
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,830
I see.

1088
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,310
I can't say it.

1089
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:05,311
I can't get close to you.

1090
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:08,310
You are so cute.

1091
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,470
You are so cute.

1092
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,330
Show me your butt.

1093
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:17,670
Show me your butt.

1094
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,810
You have a nice butt.

1095
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,270
Can I touch your butt?

1096
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,650
Let me touch you.

1097
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,090
Let me touch you.

1098
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,790
Let's do it together.

1099
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,950
Together?

1100
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,590
Emi-chan, you are pulling out a lot.

1101
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,770
I pulled out a lot.

1102
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,970
Emi-chan is pulling out a lot.

1103
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,870
I'll pull it out.

1104
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,890
It's difficult for men
to take it off like this.

1105
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,450
Can I take it off for you?

1106
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,050
Take it off for me.

1107
00:43:59,150 --> 00:43:59,410
Wait.

1108
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,970
It's difficult.

1109
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,410
Is it difficult?

1110
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,811
I'm going to take it off for you.

1111
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:16,530
It's really good.

1112
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,510
Please take it off for me.

1113
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:19,751
I'm going to take off my skirt.

1114
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,810
One, two, three.

1115
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:27,130
It's hot.

1116
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,861
What are you talking about?

1117
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,270
Your skin is so white.

1118
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,350
Yui's skin is white, too.

1119
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,870
No, I'm not.

1120
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,510
I'm white.

1121
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,590
I'm sorry.

1122
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:46,591
I'm sorry.

1123
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,190
I'm sorry.

1124
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,590
You're too drunk.

1125
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,090
I'm not drunk.

1126
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,630
You look pale.

1127
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,510
I'm not. I'm not.

1128
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,910
I want to touch you.

1129
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,130
I want to touch you, too.

1130
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,550
Can I touch you? You're so soft.

1131
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,510


1132
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:06,670
Am I? You're so soft.

1133
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,910


1134
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,490
What? You're running.

1135
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,270


1136
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:14,445
You're sweating a lot.

1137
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,670
I'm sweating a lot.

1138
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,990
Because of the alcohol.

1139
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,625
I feel something.

1140
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,210
I feel something.

1141
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,230
What?

1142
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,110
What?

1143
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:30,830
What?

1144
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:31,831
How do you feel?

1145
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,810
How do you feel?

1146
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,510
I don't want to touch you.

1147
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:38,551
I don't want to touch you.

1148
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,710
I'm waiting for you, Hoshinoko-san.

1149
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,050
I'm waiting for you.

1150
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,150
Our company is like this.

1151
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,170
It's dangerous.

1152
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,470
Is it soft? Wait a minute.

1153
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,310
One person.

1154
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,470


1155
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:12,550
I think I can be a cameraman.

1156
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,090
Why?

1157
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:16,850
Are you waiting for me?

1158
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,210
What are you going to do?

1159
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:18,690
Will you bite me?

1160
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,370
Will you use me?

1161
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,350
You chose Saji-kun,
didn't you? I chose him.

1162
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,510


1163
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,671
Are you going to take off
your clothes? Hey, hey, hey.

1164
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,830


1165
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,210
Senpai's chinpo is lonely.

1166
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,290
Are you lonely,
Senpai? Yes, I am.

1167
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,330
I'm so lonely.

1168
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,390


1169
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,570
Let's lick together.

1170
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:42,930
Let's lick together?

1171
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,290
Yes, let's lick together.

1172
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,910
Then, let's lick this side.

1173
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:48,536
Is it possible to lick
together? No problem.

1174
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,050


1175
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,170
I'll open the door.

1176
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,810
Will you lick me if I
fall down? No problem.

1177
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,170


1178
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:56,850
No problem?

1179
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,310
Really? I'm sorry.

1180
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,390
I'm sorry.

1181
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:00,210


1182
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,710
Is it OK?

1183
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,260
Oh my god!

1184
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,890
It's so nice!

1185
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,850
Isn't it too big?

1186
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,910
Isn't it a pottery?

1187
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,750
Oh my god!

1188
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,050
Please take a good picture.

1189
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,130
I'm embarrassed.

1190
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,506
Can we take a picture with three people?

1191
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,930
Yume, come here.

1192
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,370
Please touch this.

1193
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,410
Thank you.

1194
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,990
It's hard to see.

1195
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,130
You are so worried.

1196
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,710
I didn't know it was so big.

1197
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,460
It's so big.

1198
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,190
If you knew it, you would be surprised.

1199
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,870
It's amazing.

1200
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:04,910
It's like heaven.

1201
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,490
Hey, do something!

1202
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,990
I feel like I'm being touched all the time.

1203
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,810
I just turned around.

1204
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,830
Hey, touch me properly.

1205
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,470
Senior?

1206
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:41,210
Aise has a weak breasts.

1207
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,070
I don't think so.

1208
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,710
She looks erotic when I rub her breasts.

1209
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,990
Yume looks more erotic than Aise.

1210
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,250
She looks more erotic than Aise.

1211
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,350
She looks more erotic than Aise.

1212
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:14,670
Aise is so cute.

1213
00:49:14,671 --> 00:49:15,671
I hope you don't mind.

1214
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,950
No, I don't.

1215
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,790
Then, I'll have this one next.

1216
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,790
It feels good.

1217
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,980
Does it feel good?

1218
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,150
It feels really good.

1219
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,210
That's good.

1220
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,610
Which one do you like better,
Hoshinaka-senpai or me?

1221
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,550
What?

1222
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,070
I like both of you.

1223
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,630
I smell something.

1224
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,750
Oh, no.

1225
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,170
My stomach is in trouble.

1226
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:56,890
Why don't you lick Tsukki?

1227
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,010
What?

1228
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,590
Do you want me to lick Tsukki?

1229
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,290
Yes.

1230
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,070
What?

1231
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,590
OK.

1232
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,690
OK.

1233
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,050
OK.

1234
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,850
OK.

1235
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:06,910
OK.

1236
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,190
How about this?

1237
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,590
What?

1238
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:10,591
What?

1239
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,900
It's hard to do both.

1240
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,500
Yes, it is.

1241
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:23,501
Are you not used
to it? No, I'm not.

1242
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,500


1243
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,280
Both of them are big, so it's difficult.

1244
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,200
Difficult.

1245
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,300
Difficult.

1246
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
I can't stand it.

1247
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,870
It's big, isn't
it? It's amazing.

1248
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,650
It's true.

1249
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,680
It's true.

1250
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,350


1251
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,350
It's a real baby.

1252
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,071
It looks like a golden egg.

1253
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,730
What is it? It's amazing.

1254
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,590


1255
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,170
Senpai, you're doing great.

1256
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,390
It's very delicious.

1257
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:52,511
It's been a while, isn't it?

1258
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,960
Can I lick you?

1259
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,200
No, I don't want to.

1260
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,120
Can I borrow your camera?

1261
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,160
No, I don't want to.

1262
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:23,740
It's been a while, isn't it?

1263
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,740
Wait, you are taking it off by yourself.

1264
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,500
It's embarrassing.

1265
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,320
Are you serious?

1266
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:56,020
It's embarrassing, so don't get so close.

1267
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,299
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby sitting

1268
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:16,170
on a baby's lap, and
I'm very happy to see it.

1269
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,730
I'm glad I was able to see it.

1270
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:22,010
I'm glad I was able to see it.

1271
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,770
I'm glad I was able to see it.

1272
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,960
I can't do it.

1273
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,200
I can't do it.

1274
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:04,070
I can't do it.

1275
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:05,330
I can't do it.

1276
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:16,950
I can't do it.

1277
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:47,170
You are out of breath.

1278
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,310
I'm really good at this.

1279
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,330
What's that compliment?

1280
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,790
It's embarrassing.

1281
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:59,350
What's that?

1282
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:04,130
What's that? It's so erotic.

1283
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:05,910


1284
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,050
It's embarrassing.

1285
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:15,530
What's that? It's terrible.

1286
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,130


1287
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:43,390
I'm happy to be with you.

1288
00:55:43,391 --> 00:55:44,630
I'm happy to be with you.

1289
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,130
I'm happy to be with you.

1290
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,520
I feel good.

1291
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:59,740
I'm happy to be with you.

1292
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:01,840
Everyone is having fun.

1293
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,240
Which one do you
like? It feels good.

1294
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,800


1295
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,060
I should take a picture of you.

1296
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:36,810
He is touching you.

1297
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,250
He thinks it's good.

1298
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:19,490
The baby is going to be born.

1299
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,410
The baby is not yet born.

1300
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,170
The baby is in the cradle.

1301
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,530
The baby is not yet born.

1302
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,050
The baby is in the cradle.

1303
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:45,350
What are you talking
about? Wait a minute.

1304
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,730
Is it a song? Yes, it is.

1305
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,550


1306
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,990
Hime-chan, you are awesome.

1307
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,910
You are awesome, too.

1308
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,970
You are awesome, too.

1309
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,130
You are awesome, too.

1310
00:57:59,131 --> 00:57:59,950
No, I'm not.

1311
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:00,951
Are you sure? Yes, I am.

1312
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,110


1313
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,690
OK.

1314
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:57,610
How do you feel? I feel so good.

1315
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,370


1316
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,570
I'm getting a little jealous.

1317
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,290
Is that so?

1318
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:16,610
Oh, wait a minute.

1319
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,530
Can I take this? I'm so nervous.

1320
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,610
Oh, my God.

1321
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:35,530


1322
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,450
Are you nervous? Yes, I am.

1323
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,770
I feel so good.

1324
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,290
You can do it.

1325
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,310


1326
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,690
You can't do it.

1327
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:02,195
What? From behind.

1328
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:31,110


1329
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:32,170
From behind?

1330
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,750
Yes.

1331
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,480
Oh, no.

1332
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,740
It's dangerous from behind.

1333
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,650
It feels good from behind.

1334
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,110
Can you take it
off? It feels good.

1335
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:24,250


1336
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,490
I'm going to put it in.

1337
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,010
I'm going to put it in, too.

1338
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:14,110
I'm going to put it in, too.

1339
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,930
Are you all right?

1340
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:32,960
Look, there's a lot in here.

1341
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,200
You put a lot in there.

1342
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,250
Coco, let's go.

1343
01:03:11,410 --> 01:04:00,820
No, no, no, no.

1344
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:15,550
It's hot.

1345
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,010
You're losing weight.

1346
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:32,180
I can't do it.

1347
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,800
I can't do it.

1348
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,140
Do you want to do
it again? I can't do it.

1349
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,540


1350
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:45,020
What do you mean? I can't do it.

1351
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,101
Do you want to do
it again? I'm sorry.

1352
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Thank you.

1353
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,140


1354
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,676
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby who has a lot of boobs.

1355
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,820
The baby has a lot of boobs.

1356
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,760
The baby has a lot of boobs.

1357
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,080
The baby has a lot of boobs.

1358
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,380
The baby has a lot of boobs.

1359
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,800
This is the first in a long time that I
have seen Taniguchi's childHodoo's body.

1360
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:33,080
It is a very rare form of labor.

1361
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:33,900
The only other child in Taniguchi's
family was Que, his father.

1362
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:36,981
She is the only one of the Que's family
that the Taniguchi family has raised.

1363
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,140
Since she has been
raised by her mom,

1364
01:07:41,152 --> 01:07:44,420
Taniguchi has been able
to make great progress.

1365
01:07:44,421 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

1366
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:55,340
It's all right.

1367
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,660
Are you all
right? It's all right.

1368
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:05,560


1369
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:10,330
What's wrong with you?

1370
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,510
I can't stand it.

1371
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,250
Look at this.

1372
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,410
Isn't it terrible?

1373
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,850
I can't stand it.

1374
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:37,070
You are a bad boy.

1375
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:39,770
I'm sorry.

1376
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,230
I can't stand it.

1377
01:09:41,231 --> 01:09:44,670
I'm sorry. I'll do my best at work.

1378
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,830
I'm sorry.

1379
01:09:50,310 --> 01:10:01,640
Oh, my God.

1380
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,980
What's wrong with
you? Oh, my God.

1381
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,940


1382
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:19,440
You are so cute, aren't you?

1383
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:24,120
What's wrong with you?

1384
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,120
You are so excited.

1385
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,600
You are so cute.

1386
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,320
I can go deep into the mountain.

1387
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,320
Oh, it tickles.

1388
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:36,420
Let's go.

1389
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,380
I'm going to be bullied by you guys.

1390
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,180
I'm going to be bullied by you guys.

1391
01:10:43,181 --> 01:10:44,420
I'm not bullying you.

1392
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,460
I'm not bullying you.

1393
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,280
I'm not bullying you.

1394
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:50,720
I'm not bullying you.

1395
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:51,780
I'm not bullying you.

1396
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:51,820
I'm not bullying you.

1397
01:10:51,821 --> 01:10:51,920
I'm not bullying you.

1398
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,540
I'm not bullying you.

1399
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:20,170
I'm not bullying you.

1400
01:11:20,335 --> 01:11:21,790
I'm not bullying you.

1401
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,430
I'm not bullying you.

1402
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:24,431
I'm not good at it.

1403
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,200
I'm nervous.

1404
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,230
I'm getting a lot of it.

1405
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,630
Did you get it?

1406
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,650
Really?

1407
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,750
I'm not good at it.

1408
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,110
I'm getting a lot of it.

1409
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,350
I'm getting a lot of it.

1410
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:51,610
She is eating a little.

1411
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,090
It's hot.

1412
01:11:58,330 --> 01:11:59,910
She doesn't like it.

1413
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,030
I'm scared.

1414
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,270
It's hot.

1415
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:08,810
It's hot.

1416
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,730
It's dangerous.

1417
01:12:41,955 --> 01:12:43,276
Everyone does it, isn't it great?

1418
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,700
I said I don't want to see your boobs.

1419
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,240
I said I want to see my boobs.

1420
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,380
Oh, from here?

1421
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,280
I want to see it.

1422
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,260
It's disgusting.

1423
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,440
Wait a minute, Yome-chan.

1424
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,560
It's scary.

1425
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:09,561
I'm scared.

1426
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:31,740
I want to get up.

1427
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,160
Do you like to get up?

1428
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,740
I like to get up.

1429
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:51,070
You look like a toy in an amusement park.

1430
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:52,830
That's true.

1431
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,270
Wait a minute. I think I can do it.

1432
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,210
Really?

1433
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:01,550
Yes.

1434
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,150
Isn't it too early? I can do it.

1435
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:04,630
I'm sorry.

1436
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:06,330
I can't do it.

1437
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:11,930
I can do it.

1438
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:13,970
I can do it.

1439
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:14,970
I can do it.

1440
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,190
I can do it.

1441
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,670
I can't do it.

1442
01:14:16,671 --> 01:14:17,671


1443
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,190
I forgot how to do it.

1444
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,050
That's not good.

1445
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:39,810
I'm sorry.

1446
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,690
You have a delicate face.

1447
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,630
I have to record it.

1448
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,850
Are you satisfied? Yes, we are.

1449
01:14:52,795 --> 01:14:53,910
Stand up.

1450
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,970
Let's clean up.

1451
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,700
Oh, no.

1452
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,510


1453
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:04,290
We have to wear uniforms tomorrow.

1454
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:05,690
What about the day after tomorrow?

1455
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,930
The day after tomorrow...
It's good, isn't it? It's good.

1456
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:11,111
Well, it is good.

1457
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,250
Then, it's good.

1458
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,911
I don't know if the first-year
students have spare time.

1459
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,850
No, they don't.

1460
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:18,510
No, they don't.

1461
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:19,690
Oh, no.

1462
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:20,970
Are you all right?
Let's clean up.

1463
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,410
You look sleepy.

1464
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,090
I'm sleepy.

1465
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,810
You can sleep. I'll clean up.

1466
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,230
Really? Yes, you can.

1467
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:27,830


1468
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:28,450
You did a good job.

1469
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,770
Thank you.

1470
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,170
All right.

1471
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:31,910
Trash.

1472
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,070
Trash.

1473
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:33,250
Trash.

1474
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,710
All right.

1475
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,250
Clean up the table.

1476
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,310
If you bring a tissue, I
want you to feed them.

1477
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,650
Tissue?

1478
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,350
There was a tissue.

1479
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,110
Is there a tissue? Here it is.

1480
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,770
Thank you.

1481
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:52,030


1482
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:56,770
I don't have a towel.

1483
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,090
Hot!

1484
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,990
Is the shower room closed
at this time? I think so.

1485
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:08,790
I think so.

1486
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:17,350
No, the bedding is here.

1487
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,510
Oh, it's much cleaner.

1488
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:22,470
Is this garbage?

1489
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,220
Yes, this is garbage.

1490
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:28,570
Kanna, Ime-chan brought it for you.

1491
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:30,431
Oh, yes, I washed it in the bathroom.

1492
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:31,250
Certainly.

1493
01:16:31,251 --> 01:16:32,850
Where is the trash?

1494
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:34,790
I'll flush the trash.

1495
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,650
There is a trash can over there.

1496
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,910
Kobayashi.

1497
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,870
I'll flush the trash.

1498
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,050
I'll flush the trash.

1499
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:47,630
Thank you.

1500
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,410
Can I open it? Let's open it.

1501
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:53,390
Please.

1502
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:54,590
It's heavy.

1503
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:55,591


1504
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,790
Shall we put the rest in the warehouse?

1505
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,330
Yes, let's do that.

1506
01:17:15,755 --> 01:17:18,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

1507
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,550
Excuse me.

1508
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:27,190
Nice to meet you.

1509
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,290
Shall we put this in the warehouse?

1510
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,250
Don't forget your employee card.

1511
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:46,690
Thank you for your hard work.

1512
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:13,610
What should I do? Should I wait?

1513
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,026
Don't you want to see
something you don't usually see?

1514
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:22,410
I'm trying to eat now.

1515
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,750
I haven't done it yet.

1516
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:28,150
I'm not in the middle of it.

1517
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,970
I'm a little drunk.

1518
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,470
What do you want to do?

1519
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:36,170
I want to go to the president's office.

1520
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,230
Do you want to step
on the president's sofa?

1521
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,710
I want to do that.

1522
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,550
That's great.

1523
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:46,290
Let's go.

1524
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:48,950
Let's clean up this mess.

1525
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:50,950
That's right.

1526
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,130
What are you going to do?

1527
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:54,150
Should I wear it?

1528
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:55,670
No, you don't have to.

1529
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,161
You can put it on your desk.

1530
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,670
OK.

1531
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:01,030
We're almost done.

1532
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,090
I'm ready.

1533
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,030
We're almost done.

1534
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,770
The festival was amazing.

1535
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,350
It was amazing.

1536
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:21,930
The party was full of people.

1537
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,550
Everyone had a drink.

1538
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:31,991
Did I prepare too much alcohol?

1539
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,390
Maybe we bought too much.

1540
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:34,590
There were some left.

1541
01:19:34,591 --> 01:19:35,751
It's been a while, hasn't it?

1542
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:36,950
It's been a while,
hasn't it? Yes, it has.

1543
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:37,990


1544
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:42,050
The manager
said, let's buy a lot.

1545
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,170
We don't have much.

1546
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:45,690
Yes, yes.

1547
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,810
We bought too much.

1548
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:50,430
What?

1549
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,410
Did you bring the
camera? Yes, I did.

1550
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:53,970


1551
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,920
Why? Don't you
need it? Just in case.

1552
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,550


1553
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:00,210
Did you throw it away properly?

1554
01:20:00,211 --> 01:20:00,290
You said you drank a lot.

1555
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:01,710
Yes, I did.

1556
01:20:01,711 --> 01:20:02,250
What's that?

1557
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:03,390
I thought I'd keep a record.

1558
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,850
I don't need a record.

1559
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,550
You drank a lot, but were you okay?

1560
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,390
Yes, I was fine.

1561
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,110
What?

1562
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:16,890
I thought I'd stab you in the back.

1563
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,190
Were you okay? I was fine.

1564
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:20,090


1565
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,470
Aren't you weak?

1566
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,050
I might be a little weak.

1567
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:23,690
Really?

1568
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:25,150
You were pretty drunk.

1569
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:26,170
Yes.

1570
01:20:26,171 --> 01:20:27,171
Yes.

1571
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,550
What? Nothing.

1572
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:30,730
Let's go.

1573
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,750
I'm still fine.

1574
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,450


1575
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,330
What do you
mean? I'm still fine.

1576
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:39,930


1577
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:43,310
I know, but I'm still fine.

1578
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:45,310
What are you talking
about? Let's go home.

1579
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:46,390


1580
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,870
What?

1581
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:53,250
You have a big chest.

1582
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:55,650
What are you talking about?

1583
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,030
I thought it was amazing
when I saw it earlier.

1584
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:00,610
No, it's not like that.

1585
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,150
Is that so?

1586
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,650
I think it's normal.

1587
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,310
Really?

1588
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,030
What?

1589
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,670
I thought it was really cute.

1590
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,310
You don't usually say that.

1591
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:15,890
Because I can't say that at work.

1592
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:17,910
That's true.

1593
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,650
Isn't it such a character?

1594
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:20,370
It's not like that,
is it? Yes, it is.

1595
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:21,550


1596
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,950
What?

1597
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,130
No?

1598
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,630
What?

1599
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:32,110
What are you
filming? It's funny.

1600
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:32,830
Just in case.

1601
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,270
It's so funny.

1602
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,050


1603
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:41,990
What?

1604
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,416
You like chocolate pie, don't you?

1605
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,870
I was watching it.

1606
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,830
You were?

1607
01:21:45,831 --> 01:21:48,310
It's still not enough.

1608
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:52,926
What's that? You were so sexy just now.

1609
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:53,950
Yes, I was.

1610
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,130
I was so sexy.

1611
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:58,530
No, you weren't.

1612
01:21:58,910 --> 01:21:59,910
Yes, I was.

1613
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,020
I'll give you a beer.

1614
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,000
Really? Sorry.

1615
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:42,840
No problem.

1616
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:43,940
Thank you.

1617
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,300
I'm so nervous.

1618
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,900
I'm so nervous.

1619
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,560
What are you doing?

1620
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,800
No, I'm not doing anything.

1621
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,651
You're taking a picture
of a high school girl.

1622
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,780
Do you usually take pictures like that?

1623
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,780
No, it's not like that.

1624
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,720
Do you have a camera on your butt?

1625
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,300
Yes, it's very beautiful.

1626
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:50,450
There's a man in a suit.

1627
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,050
What are you talking about?

1628
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:40,290
I'm out of breath.

1629
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:01,720
It's ticklish.

1630
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:39,080
It's not hot.

1631
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:46,060
It's not hot.

1632
01:27:25,290 --> 01:28:06,770
This is a video that I
took when I was in the

1633
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:46,430
hospital for the first
time in a long time.

1634
01:28:46,431 --> 01:28:47,431
Oh!

1635
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,880
I want you to touch me.

1636
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,460
What?

1637
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:16,950
You want me to touch you?

1638
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:18,470
I want you to touch me.

1639
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,010
I did it.

1640
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:29,910
What's wrong with you?

1641
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,170
What?

1642
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:31,590
Someone is coming.

1643
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,690
Are you OK?

1644
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:35,810
I don't think so.

1645
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:36,890
You are sick.

1646
01:29:36,891 --> 01:29:38,131
I don't think it's a good idea.

1647
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,301
What if someone
else comes? Oh, I see.

1648
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:43,490


1649
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:45,430
Let's go in there.

1650
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:48,730
Let's go in there and continue.

1651
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,150
Okay.

1652
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,200
Isn't it dangerous?

1653
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,180
Is it dangerous?

1654
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,360
It's dangerous, isn't it?

1655
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,760
You're taking a lot of pictures.

1656
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,060
Because you're so cute.

1657
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,420
I'm a little embarrassed.

1658
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,440
When you look at me like this.

1659
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,400
You're right.

1660
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,361
I don't talk to you while I'm working.

1661
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,280
You don't talk to me at all.

1662
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,700
What?

1663
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:28,360
I talked to you a lot a while ago.

1664
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,981
No, because the content of
the work is a little different.

1665
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,020
Do you feel good? I feel good.

1666
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,260
It's hard here.

1667
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,170
It feels good.

1668
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:45,030


1669
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:52,910
I was surprised because you
were out of breath suddenly.

1670
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:55,310
I couldn't stand it.

1671
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:08,460
I want you to look at me.

1672
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:08,900
What?

1673
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,820
I want to be licked.

1674
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,040
I can't help it.

1675
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,720
It feels great.

1676
01:31:41,020 --> 01:33:12,390
I'm going to show you a cute
video of a cat playing with a ball.

1677
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,888
My husband and I bought a new cat
tower for the first time in a long time,

1678
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:51,960
and we are very happy to have a cat
tower for the first time in a long time.

1679
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,840
I took it out a while ago.

1680
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,640
What's that?

1681
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,320
What should I do? Sit down.

1682
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,500


1683
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:37,720
Is it like this?

1684
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,200
Yes, that's right.

1685
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,900
Oh my god!

1686
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,620
Like this?

1687
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,880
Yes.

1688
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:49,960
Is this right?

1689
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:54,920
How do you know my voice?

1690
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:56,740
I watch your videos.

1691
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,580
Oh, do you watch my videos?

1692
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,640
Yes.

1693
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,260
You are so cute.

1694
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,580
You said something.

1695
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:08,140
Yes.

1696
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:09,700
You are so soft.

1697
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,380
Am I soft?

1698
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:17,393
This is the first time
I've ever seen a cat like

1699
01:35:17,405 --> 01:35:21,280
this, and I've never
seen a cat like this before.

1700
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:53,120
I've never seen a cat like this before,
and I've never seen a cat like this before.

1701
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:55,938
This is the first time I've ever
seen a cat like this, and it's been

1702
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:58,820
a long time since I've seen a
cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

1703
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,380
I'm a little nervous.

1704
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,540
I'm a little nervous.

1705
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,770
I'm a little nervous.

1706
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,181
Mom, I want to see if
you are in a good mood.

1707
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:30,631
Mom, are you going to go out again?

1708
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,770
You can't go out in a place like this.

1709
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:42,429
This is a video of the
process of making a

1710
01:37:42,441 --> 01:38:00,200
massage chair for
the first time in my life.

1711
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,599
This is a video of the
process of making a

1712
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:05,980
massage chair for
the first time in my life.

1713
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:36,730
Tickle

1714
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,216
Do you want me to remove
the acupuncture point?

1715
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,240
Yes.

1716
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:58,610
Wow, it's amazing.

1717
01:38:58,611 --> 01:38:59,731
Wow, it's amazing, isn't it?

1718
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:03,430
Yes.

1719
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:15,000
Wow, it's amazing, isn't it?

1720
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,680
Yes.

1721
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,160
What?

1722
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:25,140
I want to make you feel good.

1723
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:26,780
Really? It's difficult.

1724
01:40:05,000 --> 01:41:04,370
It's amazing.

1725
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:05,310


1726
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:07,810
Don't open your eyes.

1727
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,030
I was worried about you.

1728
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:11,031
Really?

1729
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:56,330
I have a cat that I love so much that I
have never thought of taking a video of him.

1730
01:41:56,331 --> 01:41:56,430
It's been a while since
I have seen such a cat.

1731
01:41:56,431 --> 01:41:56,470
I'm going to take the
video of you holding the cat.

1732
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,770
Because this is the first time for
me to hold the cat, I'm a little nervous.

1733
01:41:58,771 --> 01:41:59,771
Are you ready?

1734
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:08,110
Do I have to do it automatically?

1735
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,020
Yes, do it automatically.

1736
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:10,480
It's embarrassing.

1737
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:23,800
It's embarrassing.

1738
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:55,580
It's embarrassing.

1739
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:59,840
What's that?

1740
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:18,270
I can't hold it in.

1741
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,190
Can I put it in? Yes, you can.

1742
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:22,490


1743
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:24,450
I'll put it in here.

1744
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:33,380
Can you put it in like this?

1745
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:36,021
Yes, I want to put it in like this.

1746
01:43:50,480 --> 01:44:00,290
It feels good.

1747
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:38,466
She has been in hot water for a while.

1748
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:39,771
This time, bring her some water.

1749
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:50,471
She has been in hot water
for three days, but she is okay.

1750
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:56,100
She was only a little bit hot.

1751
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,900
It's narrow and difficult, isn't it?

1752
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,500
Do you want me to ride on you?

1753
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,040
Is it OK?

1754
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,720
You're not used to it, are you?

1755
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:34,420
I can't help it, so I'll ride on you.

1756
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,280
I'm still recording.

1757
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:42,690
Yes, you are.

1758
01:45:55,275 --> 01:45:56,500
Oh, it feels so good.

1759
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,800
Oh, it feels so good.

1760
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:32,140
There's a lot in there.

1761
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:33,980
It feels so good.

1762
01:46:47,785 --> 01:46:49,730
Oh, it feels so good.

1763
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,640
Oh, it feels so good.

1764
01:48:37,335 --> 01:49:29,930
This is a video of my son and my
daughter playing in the living room.

1765
01:49:29,931 --> 01:49:30,090
My son is playing with my daughter.

1766
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,790
My son is playing with my daughter.

1767
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:40,059
This is the first time I've ever seen a
cat like this, and I've never seen a cat

1768
01:49:40,071 --> 01:49:43,251
like this before, so I'm looking forward
to seeing what kind of cat it will be.

1769
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:21,356
I'm going to take a
look at the cat's reaction.

1770
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:22,660
The cat's reaction is very good.

1771
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,390
Hi,laria.

1772
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:18,550
It's finally time to see the outlook.

1773
01:51:19,025 --> 01:51:20,346
I'm so excited to see the result.

1774
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:37,570
I'm so excited to see the result.

1775
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,110
I'm so excited.

1776
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:02,520
This is the first time I've ever seen
a cat like this, so I'm a little nervous.

1777
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:05,820
I'm so nervous.

1778
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:07,420
I'm so nervous.

1779
01:52:07,421 --> 01:52:08,421
I'm so nervous.

1780
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:09,920
I'm so nervous.

1781
01:52:09,921 --> 01:52:10,560
I'm so nervous.

1782
01:52:10,561 --> 01:52:11,561
I'm so nervous.

1783
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:15,460
I'm so nervous.

1784
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:18,220
I'm so nervous.

1785
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:30,790
I'm so nervous.

1786
01:53:13,480 --> 01:55:27,650
Aoyama-san was treated so well that it
was a big problem when he had surgery.

1787
01:56:46,810 --> 01:57:13,080
A mother fox who is not
good at letting go of her baby.

1788
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:15,281
A mother fox who is not
good at letting go of her baby.

1789
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:20,210
The mother fox who has
already given up on her baby,

1790
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,870
My husband and I bought a new cat
tower for the first time in a long time.

1791
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:08,810
The cat tower has been
in use for a long time.

1792
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,460
The cat tower has been
in use for a long time.

1793
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,620
The cat tower has been
in use for a long time.

1794
01:58:39,621 --> 01:58:40,996
I'm going to put a towel on your head.

1795
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:43,060
It's dangerous if I don't
put a towel on your head.

1796
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:43,640
That's right.

1797
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:45,220
Wait a minute.

1798
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:46,660
There's a lot on the toilet.

1799
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,680
Oh, my God.

1800
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:50,460
I'm afraid I'll get caught.

1801
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:53,576
It's okay if I put a towel on your head.

1802
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:55,240
Is it okay if I put a towel on your head?

1803
01:58:56,210 --> 01:58:57,210
Put a towel on my head.

1804
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,520
Yes.

1805
01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:10,440
Are you satisfied?

1806
01:59:11,690 --> 01:59:12,690
Yes.

1807
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:14,160
But I want to do it again.

1808
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:28,170
After this, I will come to your house.

1809
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:29,490
I want to go.

1810
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:31,430
OK.

1811
01:59:37,190 --> 01:59:38,190
Let's go home.

1812
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:38,550
OK.

1813
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:40,430
Let's go home together.

1814
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,750
OK.

1815
01:59:42,150 --> 01:59:45,170
Do you have clothes?

1816
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:46,370
Clothes?

1817
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:46,710
Yes.

1818
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,310
Are you OK? I'm OK.

1819
01:59:49,470 --> 01:59:50,470
Good morning.

1820
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:11,030
Let's go home together.

1821
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:27,670
Good morning.

1822
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,046
You've never been in here, have you?

1823
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,286
I've never been in here, either.

1824
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:31,870
Why?

1825
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,200
Haven't you been called?

1826
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,901
You've been called here, haven't you?

1827
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:37,926
If you say, I'm sorry,
you'll get a slap on the butt.

1828
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:39,010
No, I haven't.

1829
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:39,070
No, I haven't.

1830
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:39,490
That's terrible.

1831
02:00:39,491 --> 02:00:39,570
Oh, you are here.

1832
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:40,950
Yes, I am the president.

1833
02:00:44,825 --> 02:00:45,966
You don't have time for
shooting, do you? No, I don't.

1834
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:46,570


1835
02:00:46,670 --> 02:00:47,690
By the way, it's open.

1836
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:48,730
Yes, it is.

1837
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:49,230
Really?

1838
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:50,550
The security is tight.

1839
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:51,490
Yes, it is.

1840
02:00:51,491 --> 02:00:52,070
May I come in? Excuse me.

1841
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:53,370
Excuse me.

1842
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:54,650
Great.

1843
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:55,970


1844
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:57,310
Is it like this? Great.

1845
02:00:57,710 --> 02:00:58,070


1846
02:00:58,690 --> 02:00:59,370
What is this?

1847
02:00:59,371 --> 02:01:00,371
This is a living room.

1848
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:01,570
It's very nice.

1849
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:01,990
Great.

1850
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:03,330
Can I come in?

1851
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:04,970
I just came here.

1852
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:06,070
Are you OK?

1853
02:01:06,410 --> 02:01:06,490
Yes.

1854
02:01:06,491 --> 02:01:10,490
You know, when you go back to the office...

1855
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:16,310
How do you like it? It's great.

1856
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:18,430
It's great?

1857
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:20,550
I'm looking at my secretary's butt.

1858
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:22,270
What?

1859
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:23,950
I'm not touching it now.

1860
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:25,110
You're not touching
it now? No, I'm not.

1861
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:27,091
I'm looking at it.

1862
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:28,710
You're pretending to
work, aren't you? It's great.

1863
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:29,850


1864
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:36,470
It's great, isn't it?

1865
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:39,090
It's a very good chair, isn't it?

1866
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:40,630
Do you want to sit on it?

1867
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,470
I want to sit on it.

1868
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:44,770
Excuse me.

1869
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:46,970
How do you like it? It's great.

1870
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:49,211
How do you feel now? It's great.

1871
02:01:49,610 --> 02:01:50,630


1872
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,760
Please sit on it.

1873
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:54,850
What?

1874
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:56,390
Can I sit on it? Thank you.

1875
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:58,770


1876
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:06,420
How is it? It's small.

1877
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,600


1878
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:13,100
But I think the height
of the desk is just right.

1879
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:16,240
You look like a very small president.

1880
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,921
And you look like
you're having a hard time.

1881
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:24,080
What? Me?

1882
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:24,380
Yes.

1883
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,660
Touch the person next to you with a stick.

1884
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:28,700
Touch.

1885
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:29,180
Touch.

1886
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:30,680
Touch.

1887
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:32,470
Kasia, Totoki.

1888
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:34,940
Makizuni.

1889
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:36,320
Makizuni.

1890
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:39,880
That's good. Is that all you can do?

1891
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,400
What?

1892
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:43,600
More?

1893
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,400
More?

1894
02:02:46,065 --> 02:02:47,666
I think Uchinoichi-sensei is in trouble.

1895
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,900
I just felt that
Uchinoichi-sensei is in trouble.

1896
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:51,980
Give it to me!

1897
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:53,840
What did you do?

1898
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,880
I'm trying to put my butt on it.

1899
02:02:58,460 --> 02:02:59,680
It's not good, is it?

1900
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,060
I'll try to sit on it.

1901
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:02,400
Are you sure?

1902
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:03,660
Please sit on it.

1903
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,000
Really? I'm holding it.

1904
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:06,380


1905
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:08,060
What's wrong?

1906
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,360
How do I look?

1907
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:14,111
You look like a female president.

1908
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:17,060
But you're going to sleep there
anyway, right? It's a reward.

1909
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:21,900
It's like a lap
pillow, isn't it?

1910
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:24,980
It's like a lap pillow, isn't it?

1911
02:03:25,445 --> 02:03:26,740
Can I put it on? It's cute.

1912
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:28,520
It's cute.

1913
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:30,380


1914
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:31,720
It's like a lap pillow,
isn't it? It's cute.

1915
02:03:31,721 --> 02:03:34,420


1916
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:39,300
don't you have anything more to say?

1917
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:39,820
More?

1918
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:41,580
What the president doesn't like.

1919
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:47,680
What the president doesn't like.

1920
02:03:47,681 --> 02:03:48,681
It's like Sekuhara.

1921
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:51,120
It's crazy.

1922
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,180
It's crazy.

1923
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:55,480
I consulted with him.

1924
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:56,780
What did you do?

1925
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,680
When we were alone in the
elevator, he touched my boobs.

1926
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:05,460
Have you ever been
touched? No, I haven't.

1927
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:07,200


1928
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,960
No? What?

1929
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:11,220
Let's play the video again.

1930
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:14,100
We're in the elevator.

1931
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,660
We're in the elevator.

1932
02:04:17,661 --> 02:04:21,560
If you do that, it will be like this.

1933
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,920
That's terrible.

1934
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:26,780
You have to take revenge.

1935
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:28,280
That's terrible.

1936
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,160
Then, I will take revenge.

1937
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:32,380
What?

1938
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:33,420
What will you do?

1939
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:37,360
I will have my tongue rubbed.

1940
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,181
Your tongue will be rubbed?

1941
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:40,860
That's terrible.

1942
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,760
What will you do?

1943
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,640
Will you rub it on your boss's desk?

1944
02:04:43,641 --> 02:04:44,961
I'm going to rub it on your back.

1945
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:46,460
I'm going to rub it on your son.

1946
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:48,580
Like this, right? I'm sorry.

1947
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:50,320
Really? Really.

1948
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:51,080


1949
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:51,940


1950
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,640
You're going to rub it on my back?

1951
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:55,920
Then I'm going to get revenge.

1952
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:56,600
I'm going to do it three times.

1953
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,120
Ah!

1954
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,460
Is she sleeping?

1955
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,680
She's not sexy, is she?

1956
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:04,460
Really? She's doing it.

1957
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:05,820


1958
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:06,880
I'm going to rub it on your back.

1959
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:08,180
Is she doing it?

1960
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:11,350
I'm going to do it.

1961
02:05:11,570 --> 02:05:12,570
It's so beautiful.

1962
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:14,130
It's beautiful.

1963
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:15,390
Let's get in.

1964
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:18,921
I think there is a baby's play area.

1965
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:20,470
I don't like it.

1966
02:05:22,450 --> 02:05:23,891
I think there is a baby's play area.

1967
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:24,130
I think there is a baby's play area.

1968
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:24,490
I think there is a baby's play area.

1969
02:05:24,491 --> 02:05:24,650
I think there is a baby's play area.

1970
02:05:25,450 --> 02:05:26,890
I think there is a baby's play area.

1971
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:30,170
I think there is a baby's play area.

1972
02:05:30,171 --> 02:05:31,236
I think there is a baby's play area.

1973
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:32,750
I think there is a baby's play area.

1974
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:36,210
I think there is a baby's play area.

1975
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:40,230
I think there is a baby's play area.

1976
02:05:40,231 --> 02:05:40,470
I think there is a baby's play area.

1977
02:05:40,471 --> 02:05:40,710
I think there is a baby's play area.

1978
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,390
I think there is a baby's play area.

1979
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,390
I haven't been there much.

1980
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:44,770
Where? In the dressing room?

1981
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:45,890
Yes.

1982
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:47,170
I was here.

1983
02:05:48,070 --> 02:05:49,070
What? Wait a minute.

1984
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:49,730


1985
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:51,230
You can't make a joke,
can you? No, I can't.

1986
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:52,270


1987
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:54,430
I have a lot of questions.

1988
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:56,190
You have a lot of questions?

1989
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:57,870
Yes.

1990
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:00,630
Do you have a
boyfriend? Yes, I do.

1991
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:02,310


1992
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:03,410
What? Wait a minute.

1993
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:06,910


1994
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:08,710
You haven't heard about me, have you?

1995
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:09,790
I haven't heard about you.

1996
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:10,350
Really?

1997
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:11,400
Has it changed?

1998
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:13,350
Maybe this year?

1999
02:06:13,610 --> 02:06:14,610
Did you change your mind?

2000
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:18,370
I thought you were the president,
so I asked you a question.

2001
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:19,090
What did you ask me?

2002
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:20,790
Well,

2003
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:26,670
Do you do such a sexy thing alone?

2004
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:29,230
Do you do such a sexy thing alone?

2005
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,320
What did you answer?

2006
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:35,010
I can't answer that.

2007
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:37,210
I can't get in unless I answer honestly.

2008
02:06:38,150 --> 02:06:39,150
That's right.

2009
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:47,390
I can't get in unless I answer honestly.

2010
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:50,490
I like fat guys.

2011
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:51,810
I like fat guys.

2012
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:56,330
Is it a miracle?

2013
02:06:57,330 --> 02:07:04,210
Is it a miracle?

2014
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:10,730
I like a person who can make
me laugh and deceive me like this.

2015
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:13,210
I think so, too.

2016
02:07:13,211 --> 02:07:14,446
Because you are likely to get angry.

2017
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:15,470
Me, too.

2018
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:18,990
I'm likely to get angry.

2019
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:25,770
Look, raise your legs.

2020
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:27,250
What?

2021
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:27,650
Raise your legs.

2022
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:29,030
I'll get angry.

2023
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,630
What? Look.

2024
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:30,750


2025
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:32,210
I can't help it.

2026
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:33,211
You are so kind.

2027
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:36,130
You will give me a bonus.

2028
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,930
I will give you a bonus.

2029
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:43,170
No, I won't.

2030
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:44,730
I won't give you a bonus.

2031
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:50,310
I won't give you a bonus.

2032
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:52,891
How much bonus do you want me to give you?

2033
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:57,110
Well, the bonus is... 5 times?

2034
02:07:57,390 --> 02:07:58,570
5 times!

2035
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:00,770
Oh my god!

2036
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:03,470
I'm sure you'll get a lot of love.

2037
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:07,070
I won't give you more than 5 times.

2038
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:08,630
I won't give you more than 5 times.

2039
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:13,301
By the way, I don't have sex with you two.

2040
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:15,670
What?

2041
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:16,810
What did you say?

2042
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:17,770
Oh, you're right.

2043
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:19,430
Oh, you're right. I don't.

2044
02:08:19,431 --> 02:08:20,431
I want to.

2045
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,430
What? I want to.

2046
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:23,810


2047
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:25,221
Do you still have a crush
on me? Of course I do.

2048
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:27,871
Don't underestimate
the safety of men.

2049
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:28,930
Great!

2050
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:29,050
Great! I'm fine.

2051
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:30,370


2052
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:34,770
I'd like to see you two
playing with each other.

2053
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:37,130
What?

2054
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:39,110
Do you feel good with girls?

2055
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:42,550
I feel good when I'm touched.

2056
02:08:43,410 --> 02:08:44,410
Oh!

2057
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:45,930
You're so active.

2058
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:47,870
You touched me a little while ago.

2059
02:08:48,030 --> 02:08:49,030
I did.

2060
02:08:49,270 --> 02:08:50,270
It felt good.

2061
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:51,650
Can I see you for a moment?

2062
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:53,570
I'll take a good picture of you.

2063
02:08:53,571 --> 02:08:55,131
I wonder if I can take a picture of it.

2064
02:08:57,490 --> 02:08:58,830
Do you like that kind of thing?

2065
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,030
I buy a lot of those AVs.

2066
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:03,570
No, you don't.

2067
02:09:03,930 --> 02:09:04,210
Really?

2068
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:05,770
Of course, I do.

2069
02:09:08,070 --> 02:09:09,870
What should I do? Where
should I go? I'm confused.

2070
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:11,610


2071
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:18,650
I'm a little nervous.

2072
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:19,370
Right?

2073
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:21,050
I don't usually do this.

2074
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:25,670
There were a lot of people
earlier, so I was in a good mood.

2075
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:33,951
I don't think the president will think so.

2076
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:38,220
A young woman has sex at her desk.

2077
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:41,580
The president hasn't come back yet.

2078
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,480
I don't think he'll come back today.

2079
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,940
I'm sure he'll be fine.
He's young and fast.

2080
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:48,900
Are you angry?

2081
02:09:48,901 --> 02:09:49,901
Are you angry?

2082
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:50,660
Are you angry?

2083
02:09:50,661 --> 02:09:52,420
Are you angry, Ushi?

2084
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:58,060
Oh, I can see it.

2085
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:01,270
Please take a good picture of it.

2086
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:02,586
Are you going to take a picture of it?

2087
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:05,430
I don't remember at all what I saw earlier.

2088
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:09,570
But this is cute,
isn't it? It's cute.

2089
02:10:09,710 --> 02:10:10,110


2090
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:12,030
It's cuter to wear it, isn't it?

2091
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:16,610
You look like you want to touch it.

2092
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:18,670
Don't you want to touch it?

2093
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:19,110
I'm not sure if I can touch it.

2094
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,810
You can keep touching it.

2095
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,370
I want to touch it.

2096
02:10:30,205 --> 02:10:31,205
I can't touch it.

2097
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,150
I got it.

2098
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:34,710
Thank you.

2099
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:41,710
It's good.

2100
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:46,490
I touched it.

2101
02:10:48,910 --> 02:10:53,050
I touched it.

2102
02:10:58,640 --> 02:10:59,640
No?

2103
02:11:00,730 --> 02:11:01,750
You're so aggressive.

2104
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:05,810
You were aggressive towards Kobayashi-kun.

2105
02:11:06,290 --> 02:11:08,390
Yes, I was.

2106
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:11,510
I turned on the power switch.

2107
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:13,490
Really? Excuse me.

2108
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:29,350


2109
02:11:32,190 --> 02:11:34,470
No, I'm embarrassed.

2110
02:11:34,990 --> 02:11:35,690
Are you sweating?

2111
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:36,930
I'm embarrassed.

2112
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:42,630
Your nipples are really beautiful.

2113
02:11:43,330 --> 02:11:45,650
How do you feel?

2114
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:47,170
It feels so good.

2115
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:48,350
Does it feel good?

2116
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:59,210
If you attack both of
my nipples, I'll bite you.

2117
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:00,610
Oh, no.

2118
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,150
Oh, no.

2119
02:12:03,151 --> 02:12:04,151
This is bad.

2120
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:06,690
Isn't it bad to blame
your junior by yourself?

2121
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:09,870
It's bad, isn't it?

2122
02:12:16,190 --> 02:12:20,190
I want you to lick me, too.

2123
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:23,010
What? Don't you want to lick me?

2124
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:24,920
What's that?

2125
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:28,530
It's good, but it's like
being used by a good toy.

2126
02:12:28,531 --> 02:12:30,526
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat using it.

2127
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:32,790
Can you use it? Excuse me.

2128
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:36,450


2129
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:39,850
It's hot here, isn't
it? It's hot here.

2130
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:41,350


2131
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:45,850
If I turn on the air conditioner,
the cat will be in danger.

2132
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:48,210
I see.

2133
02:12:52,220 --> 02:12:53,220
Great.

2134
02:12:58,620 --> 02:13:00,030
It's cold.

2135
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,970
Does it feel good?

2136
02:13:06,290 --> 02:13:09,590
I want to touch you.

2137
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:25,010
I've never seen a female
dog so close to a male dog.

2138
02:13:25,011 --> 02:13:26,011
I don't have one.

2139
02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:27,290
You don't have one, do you?

2140
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:31,310
It matches with you.

2141
02:13:31,930 --> 02:13:32,930
What?

2142
02:13:33,870 --> 02:13:34,870
How about you?

2143
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:36,250
This one?

2144
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:37,330
I was surprised.

2145
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:42,450
Rinkutaro.

2146
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:43,790
Oh, my God.

2147
02:13:56,830 --> 02:13:57,830
You just licked it.

2148
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:02,350
Oh, good.

2149
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:04,470
I want to take it off.

2150
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,010
Really?

2151
02:14:05,450 --> 02:14:06,450
I'm laughing so hard.

2152
02:14:08,810 --> 02:14:09,810
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

2153
02:14:10,630 --> 02:14:11,630


2154
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:17,001
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

2155
02:14:22,750 --> 02:14:23,750
Wow.

2156
02:14:23,890 --> 02:14:24,830
Oh, my God.

2157
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:25,870
I licked your boobs.

2158
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:27,550
Oh, my God.

2159
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:30,210
Oh, it feels good.

2160
02:14:31,950 --> 02:14:33,250
It's getting really hard.

2161
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:34,950
Oh, my God.

2162
02:14:43,510 --> 02:14:47,670
I am a little shy.

2163
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:57,080
It feels good.

2164
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:58,740
Senpai is good.

2165
02:14:59,580 --> 02:14:59,640
What? Senpai is good.

2166
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:02,220
You are good.

2167
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:04,020
I am excited.

2168
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,280
You are good.

2169
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:10,900
I am excited.

2170
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:13,420
It feels good.

2171
02:15:13,421 --> 02:15:14,620
It's smooth.

2172
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:19,520


2173
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:24,140
Can I serve you more?

2174
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:25,460
Can you? Of course.

2175
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:27,140
I'll lick you.

2176
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:32,600


2177
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:35,110
What?

2178
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:36,620
Yes.

2179
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:39,260
I want to lick you.

2180
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:41,400
Excuse me.

2181
02:15:44,430 --> 02:15:57,290
I'm going to take off my clothes.

2182
02:15:57,291 --> 02:15:58,611
You should take off your clothes.

2183
02:15:59,110 --> 02:16:00,190
It's not good to get dirty.

2184
02:16:00,370 --> 02:16:02,010
You look like an old man on the way home.

2185
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:03,970
It's not good to get dirty.

2186
02:16:08,895 --> 02:16:09,895
You look nice.

2187
02:16:11,375 --> 02:16:12,730
I wanted to take off my clothes.

2188
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:43,180
She is sniffing.

2189
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:53,470
Are you good at sniffing?

2190
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:55,990
Yes, I am good at sniffing.

2191
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:04,150
Are you going for a walk?

2192
02:17:04,490 --> 02:17:05,490
Oh, my God!

2193
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:15,570
Oh, my God!

2194
02:17:17,850 --> 02:17:49,280
Oh, my God!

2195
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:08,610
What's going on?

2196
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:09,930
Oh, my God! Wait a minute.

2197
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:20,560
Isn't it bigger than the
last one? No, it's not.

2198
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,920
It's the same size as usual.

2199
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,730
This one, too.

2200
02:18:26,890 --> 02:18:28,130
Oh, no!

2201
02:18:28,131 --> 02:18:29,830
Hey, I'm licking you. Take it off.

2202
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:31,090
I'll take it off.

2203
02:18:33,410 --> 02:18:34,530
Oh, no!

2204
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:41,930
Oh, no!

2205
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:43,070
Oh, no!

2206
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:43,570
Oh, no!

2207
02:18:43,571 --> 02:18:43,590
Oh, no!

2208
02:18:43,591 --> 02:18:44,591
Oh, no!

2209
02:18:59,775 --> 02:19:00,850
You're grabbing me.

2210
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:02,510
Oh, no!

2211
02:19:02,511 --> 02:19:04,630
You know how I feel, don't you?

2212
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:54,330
Oh, no!

2213
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:55,000
Oh, no!

2214
02:19:55,001 --> 02:19:55,480
Oh, no!

2215
02:19:55,481 --> 02:19:56,481
Oh, no!

2216
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:01,160
Oh, no!

2217
02:20:01,161 --> 02:20:01,300
Are you okay?

2218
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,990
Wait a minute!

2219
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:21,590
Don't do it!

2220
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:27,580
Oh, my God!

2221
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:29,560
You are bullying me.

2222
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:31,140
I'm not bullying you.

2223
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:33,200
Are you okay?

2224
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:34,440
Oh, my God!

2225
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:37,340
This is a difficult one.

2226
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:39,040
Oh, my God!

2227
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:40,760
Oh!

2228
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:42,360
The seal has come out.

2229
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:44,720
Do you want to know what's next?

2230
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:46,440
Oh, my God!

2231
02:20:46,441 --> 02:20:47,620
Oh, no!

2232
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:56,220
It's so hot!

2233
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:57,520
Do you want to
take it off? Yes, I do.

2234
02:20:58,460 --> 02:20:59,481
May I?

2235
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:01,950
It's so hot!

2236
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:05,720
It's so hot!

2237
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:11,400
Do you want to take it off that much?

2238
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:14,840
It's so hot, isn't it?

2239
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:16,480
Oh, no!

2240
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:19,860
Shoya, you are wrong.

2241
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:21,220
Oh, really?

2242
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:23,520
Then, one by one, please.

2243
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:26,740
One by one?

2244
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:28,160
Yes, one by one, please.

2245
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:29,180
One by one? Excuse me.

2246
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:32,980


2247
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:42,140
Wow, it's so big.

2248
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:43,720
Is it big?

2249
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,760
Do you compare it with Kobayashi-kun?

2250
02:21:44,761 --> 02:21:45,801
Are you comparing
with me? Yes, I am.

2251
02:21:45,930 --> 02:21:47,580


2252
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:48,900
Oh, no!

2253
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:58,580
I want Senpai to lick me soon.

2254
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:02,200
She seems to enjoy licking you.

2255
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:03,620
Right?

2256
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:05,960
She is really big.

2257
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:06,940
Really?

2258
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:10,920
I think she is the biggest in the company.

2259
02:22:10,921 --> 02:22:12,660
It's the biggest in the world, isn't it?

2260
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:13,920
Yes, it looks like the biggest.

2261
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,020
If I put it in here, will I be happy?

2262
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:23,780
If you put it in here,
you'll be happy, won't you?

2263
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:26,620
You'll be happy, won't you?

2264
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:30,670
You'll be happy, won't you?

2265
02:22:30,671 --> 02:22:31,671
Wow! Wait a minute.

2266
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:36,730
I think it's better to
take off my clothes.

2267
02:22:37,730 --> 02:22:38,730
Yes, just like that.

2268
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:53,190
The baby is full.

2269
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:21,450
The baby is too energetic.

2270
02:23:47,150 --> 02:23:52,230
This is a video I took when I was a baby.

2271
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:53,250
I'm not good at talking.

2272
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:57,030
I'm not good at talking.

2273
02:23:57,210 --> 02:23:58,210
I'm not good at talking.

2274
02:24:02,135 --> 02:24:03,730
I'm getting a lot of comments
that I'm not good at eating.

2275
02:24:03,731 --> 02:24:04,850
I'm not good at eating well.

2276
02:24:04,851 --> 02:24:05,790
I'm not good at eating well.

2277
02:24:05,791 --> 02:24:07,570
I'm not good at eating well.

2278
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:11,610
Can I lick here too? Yeah.

2279
02:24:12,410 --> 02:24:13,150
Yeah? Yeah.

2280
02:24:13,151 --> 02:24:14,151


2281
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:15,370


2282
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:20,710
Ah, this side comes.

2283
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:23,470
Somehow.

2284
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:32,930
This is Tengu?

2285
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:38,310
Does the president always do this?

2286
02:24:39,790 --> 02:24:41,890
But you can do this,
right? Yes, I can.

2287
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:42,990
Great.

2288
02:24:58,140 --> 02:24:59,140


2289
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:20,090
I'm a little nervous.

2290
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,706
Will you get angry if I shoot it suddenly?

2291
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:22,730
What?

2292
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:24,870
Will you get angry if I shoot it suddenly?

2293
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:26,150
That's not good.

2294
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:28,970
You look happy.

2295
02:25:29,930 --> 02:25:30,930
That makes me happy.

2296
02:25:32,010 --> 02:25:33,970
But I'll get a lot of pictures on my face.

2297
02:25:35,150 --> 02:25:36,590
You look like you're in a good mood.

2298
02:25:37,110 --> 02:25:38,350
I'm holding it in.

2299
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:46,770
It feels so good.

2300
02:25:47,450 --> 02:25:48,706
Do you want a change
of clothes? Yes, I do.

2301
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:49,850
I want it.

2302
02:25:58,975 --> 02:26:00,055
It's too erotic.

2303
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:01,270
Why?

2304
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:02,450
It's too erotic.

2305
02:26:03,470 --> 02:26:04,470
You're sweating a lot.

2306
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:36,850
She's doing something crazy, isn't she?

2307
02:26:37,950 --> 02:26:39,610
She's doing something
crazy, isn't she? Wait a minute.

2308
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:47,810
Stop, stop.

2309
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:49,050
Go, go, go.

2310
02:26:49,790 --> 02:26:50,790
Wait a minute.

2311
02:26:51,150 --> 02:26:52,170
Wait a minute.

2312
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:54,410
What's wrong?

2313
02:26:54,411 --> 02:26:56,670
I thought my nose was going to explode.

2314
02:26:58,370 --> 02:26:58,950
That was close.

2315
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:00,290
Was it really close?

2316
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:01,970
Yes, it was really close.

2317
02:27:02,910 --> 02:27:03,910
Let's switch.

2318
02:27:04,390 --> 02:27:05,390
Switch?

2319
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:07,610
What should we do?

2320
02:27:07,830 --> 02:27:09,670
Do you want to do it
at the president's table?

2321
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:11,106
Or do you want to do it
on the sofa? It's up to you.

2322
02:27:11,130 --> 02:27:12,130


2323
02:27:13,150 --> 02:27:14,150
Sofa?

2324
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:16,020
Sofa?

2325
02:27:19,050 --> 02:27:20,050
Is it dangerous? I don't know.

2326
02:27:20,610 --> 02:27:21,610


2327
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:23,730
I'm scared if I break it.

2328
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:26,290
Where are you looking at?

2329
02:27:26,490 --> 02:27:27,490
I'm looking at the bench.

2330
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:34,630
How do you want me to look at you?

2331
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:37,050
I just want you to feel good.

2332
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:39,850
Please hug me.

2333
02:27:40,770 --> 02:27:45,490
I'm going to hug you.

2334
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:59,090
I'm going to hug you.

2335
02:27:59,091 --> 02:28:00,970
I'm going to hug you.

2336
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:02,850
I'm going to hug you.

2337
02:28:04,910 --> 02:28:05,910
I'm going to hug you.

2338
02:28:06,730 --> 02:28:07,730
I'm sorry.

2339
02:28:09,230 --> 02:28:10,410
I'm sorry.

2340
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:13,470
I'm sorry.

2341
02:28:13,650 --> 02:28:16,650
I'm sorry.

2342
02:28:16,651 --> 02:28:17,090
I'm sorry.

2343
02:28:17,091 --> 02:28:18,091
I'm sorry.

2344
02:28:27,990 --> 02:28:28,990
I'm sorry.

2345
02:28:31,550 --> 02:28:32,550
I'm sorry.

2346
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:34,550
I'm sorry.

2347
02:28:35,070 --> 02:28:36,070
I'm sorry.

2348
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:47,150
I'm sorry.

2349
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:48,590
I'm sorry.

2350
02:28:48,591 --> 02:28:48,870
I'm sorry.

2351
02:28:48,871 --> 02:28:50,130
I'm sorry.

2352
02:28:50,131 --> 02:29:02,400
I'm so glad to see you.

2353
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,720
You look so nervous.

2354
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:21,410
You're going to go, Senpai?

2355
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:33,600
You're going to be barefoot.

2356
02:29:49,610 --> 02:29:50,910
What's wrong?

2357
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:53,970
Are you okay?

2358
02:29:53,971 --> 02:29:55,090
Oh, no!

2359
02:29:55,890 --> 02:29:56,890
Oh, no!

2360
02:29:58,450 --> 02:29:58,670
Oh, no!

2361
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:06,810
What's wrong?

2362
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:08,970
What's going on?

2363
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:12,850
Oh, no!

2364
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:15,910
Oh, no!

2365
02:30:15,911 --> 02:30:16,911
Oh, no!

2366
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:19,230
Are you okay?

2367
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:21,150
Oh, no!

2368
02:30:21,151 --> 02:30:25,870
Gomen-kutsu,gomen-kutsu.

2369
02:30:26,090 --> 02:30:27,090
There's no proof.

2370
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:09,000
Thank you for the meal.

2371
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:10,680
That's dangerous.

2372
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:12,360
It's so beautiful.

2373
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,040
Do you want to do it?

2374
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:18,020
No, I have to change my clothes.

2375
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,120
Do you have to change
your clothes? It's not good.

2376
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:23,560
It's not good.

2377
02:31:23,561 --> 02:31:23,740


2378
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:24,940
It's not good? It's not good.

2379
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
It's not good.

2380
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:29,300
I just wiped it, so it's okay.

2381
02:31:31,730 --> 02:31:34,560
Don't you smell it?

2382
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:35,740
Don't you smell it?

2383
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:36,880
It's not a stain.

2384
02:31:36,881 --> 02:31:37,881
Isn't it good? It's hot.

2385
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:54,270
It's hot.

2386
02:31:55,050 --> 02:31:55,170
It's very hot.

2387
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:56,590
It's not good.

2388
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:57,970
It's not good.

2389
02:32:00,550 --> 02:32:01,550
Wait a minute.

2390
02:32:02,210 --> 02:32:02,910


2391
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:04,110
Is it not good? It's not good.

2392
02:32:04,350 --> 02:32:05,350
It's not good.

2393
02:32:06,930 --> 02:32:07,930


2394
02:32:08,930 --> 02:32:10,350
This is not good.

2395
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:13,810
Her technique is not good.

2396
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:15,430
How did you learn it?

2397
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:17,250
I think she is not good at it.

2398
02:32:18,350 --> 02:32:19,350
What?

2399
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:21,410
Is it because of her passion for research?

2400
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:22,610
I want her to feel good.

2401
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:26,260
If you move the camera there,

2402
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:29,050
I wonder if it will move.

2403
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:34,810
I want to see your face closer.

2404
02:32:34,811 --> 02:32:36,790
Please wait a moment.

2405
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:38,790
Is it bad?

2406
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:48,080
Is it bad?

2407
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:57,060
Is it bad?

2408
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:12,900
Please wait a moment.

2409
02:33:25,130 --> 02:33:27,190
Are you serious? Come here.

2410
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:31,930


2411
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:38,630
Let's get along with each other.

2412
02:33:38,670 --> 02:33:39,990
Do you want to get along with me?

2413
02:33:46,610 --> 02:33:48,210
Let's get along with each other.

2414
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:52,590
What are you doing?

2415
02:33:52,750 --> 02:33:53,750
You look like a man.

2416
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:04,240
Do you want to get along
with me? Wait a minute.

2417
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:06,380
Don't do that.

2418
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:07,900
Don't do that.

2419
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:09,400
Wait a minute.

2420
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:12,440


2421
02:34:17,220 --> 02:34:26,490
Do you think it's better to
play with me? I don't know.

2422
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:28,260
Wait a minute.

2423
02:34:28,590 --> 02:34:29,710


2424
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:30,830
No.

2425
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:34,080
It hurts.

2426
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:35,540
No.

2427
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:25,190
Don't laugh.

2428
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:28,030
You are laughing.

2429
02:35:28,530 --> 02:35:28,990
You are laughing.

2430
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:30,250
Are you laughing?

2431
02:35:30,290 --> 02:35:31,450
I didn't notice.

2432
02:35:31,590 --> 02:35:32,590
Are you OK?

2433
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:41,780
Are you OK?

2434
02:35:41,781 --> 02:35:42,781
Are you OK? No, I'm not.

2435
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:45,440
Are you OK? Oh, no.

2436
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:47,240


2437
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:49,460
I'm going to be scolded.

2438
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:52,780
Are you OK? Oh, no.

2439
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:55,600
Excuse me.

2440
02:35:57,010 --> 02:35:59,380
I'm going to be scolded.

2441
02:35:59,381 --> 02:36:00,381
Can I go now?

2442
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:01,580
What?

2443
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:02,860
I think I've loosened up.

2444
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:04,060
Can I go now? Yes, you have.

2445
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:05,720


2446
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:07,240
I've massaged you a lot.

2447
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,320
I don't want to.

2448
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:11,080
Can I go now?

2449
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:14,940
I want to put Senpai's picture in it, too.

2450
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:16,980
You said that, didn't you?

2451
02:36:16,981 --> 02:36:18,340
I said it twice.

2452
02:36:18,440 --> 02:36:19,440
I'm so active.

2453
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:21,080
What do you want to put in it?

2454
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:22,380
Can I?

2455
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:23,600
Can I turn the
camera to you? Sure.

2456
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:24,580
Look at it.

2457
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:25,100


2458
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:26,840
Do you want to lie down?

2459
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:28,200
What?

2460
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:29,100
Is it better to lie down?

2461
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:30,360
It's better to lie down.

2462
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,940
What? Put this in it.

2463
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:33,720


2464
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:34,840
Oh, coffee beans.

2465
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:35,480
Coffee beans.

2466
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:36,720
With a coffee bean cushion.

2467
02:36:36,721 --> 02:36:37,721
I'm going to take a bath.

2468
02:36:41,490 --> 02:36:42,490
Please.

2469
02:36:42,990 --> 02:36:49,080
It's big.

2470
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:49,920
Is it big?

2471
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:51,680
Your bath is big.

2472
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:54,840
I'm back to normal.

2473
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:05,750
How do you feel? I'm so nervous.

2474
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:07,930
I feel great.

2475
02:37:08,770 --> 02:37:12,190
I feel like I'm
going to explode.

2476
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:13,950
Really?

2477
02:37:14,090 --> 02:37:17,610
I was patient to go to the vet, so
it's not strange to go out at any time.

2478
02:37:22,510 --> 02:37:24,550
I feel good.

2479
02:37:27,535 --> 02:37:28,590
That's a honorific.

2480
02:37:30,365 --> 02:37:31,525
Choco-chan is already eating.

2481
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:36,610
I thought it was that,
but that's a honorific.

2482
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:38,130
I feel good.

2483
02:38:22,210 --> 02:38:23,570
Do you have anything you don't do?

2484
02:38:26,490 --> 02:38:27,710
How do you feel? I feel so good.

2485
02:38:27,850 --> 02:38:30,370
You feel good,
don't you? Yes, I do.

2486
02:38:30,371 --> 02:38:31,371


2487
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:37,690
He is laughing at me.

2488
02:38:39,170 --> 02:38:41,190
It's fun to take a video like this.

2489
02:38:41,830 --> 02:38:42,830
It's fun.

2490
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:44,130
It's your first time, isn't it?

2491
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:45,730
Of course, it is.

2492
02:38:45,731 --> 02:38:46,731
It's dangerous, isn't it?

2493
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:48,200
Please say that you usually do it.

2494
02:38:58,260 --> 02:38:59,260
How do you feel? It's the best.

2495
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:01,080


2496
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,400
Isn't her face
cute? It's so cute.

2497
02:39:58,610 --> 02:39:59,610


2498
02:39:59,810 --> 02:40:00,810
It's embarrassing.

2499
02:40:00,930 --> 02:40:02,190
Her voice is cute, too.

2500
02:40:03,450 --> 02:40:04,450
Hold on tight.

2501
02:40:09,810 --> 02:40:18,170
Her butt is cute.

2502
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:38,740
Is it dangerous?

2503
02:40:47,590 --> 02:40:49,190
He touched my butt.

2504
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:54,770
He touched my butt.

2505
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:24,840
Your butt is amazing.

2506
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:28,380
Your butt is twitching.

2507
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:32,100
Let's go to annoy the president.

2508
02:41:32,700 --> 02:41:33,700
What? Wait a minute.

2509
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,860


2510
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:42,720
Oh my gosh!

2511
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:49,820
This is terrible.

2512
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,440
I can't do this.

2513
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:54,720
I can't sit on the president's desk.

2514
02:41:56,060 --> 02:41:57,400
You'll be scolded.

2515
02:41:57,960 --> 02:41:58,960
I'll be scolded.

2516
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:01,300
Oh my gosh!

2517
02:42:03,100 --> 02:42:05,420
Oh my gosh, it feels so good.

2518
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:09,960
Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK.

2519
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:11,240


2520
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:13,760
Oh, no!

2521
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:15,260
Are you OK?

2522
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:16,460
Yes, I feel so bad.

2523
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:18,560
Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK.

2524
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:19,940


2525
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:21,040
Are you OK?

2526
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:22,900
Oh, no!

2527
02:42:37,420 --> 02:42:38,480
Do you feel bad?

2528
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:40,580
Oh, no!

2529
02:42:41,540 --> 02:42:42,620
Oh, no!

2530
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:44,540
Oh, no! I'm scared.

2531
02:42:44,541 --> 02:42:45,541
It's dangerous.

2532
02:42:47,240 --> 02:42:48,420


2533
02:42:49,480 --> 02:42:51,400
It's really dangerous if you get caught.

2534
02:42:51,401 --> 02:42:53,100
I have to check your chest, too.

2535
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:55,300
It's more dangerous.

2536
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:57,800
You'll get caught if you get caught.

2537
02:43:22,865 --> 02:43:23,900
Take it off.

2538
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:26,120
What's going on? It's difficult.

2539
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:29,281
What?

2540
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:33,780
You look so cool.

2541
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:36,120
What?

2542
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:39,100
Am I on the screen?
Yes, you are.

2543
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:40,600


2544
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:46,240
Is it the same one? Yes, it is.

2545
02:43:46,890 --> 02:43:48,120
The white one.

2546
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:50,860
The white one was in the frame.

2547
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:52,220
Was it? Yes, it was.

2548
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:53,480


2549
02:43:53,630 --> 02:43:54,800
Pass the camera to her.

2550
02:43:54,801 --> 02:43:54,860
What?

2551
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:56,460
I don't know what to do.

2552
02:43:58,540 --> 02:43:59,060
Can you do it? Let's try.

2553
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:00,280


2554
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:01,720
OK.

2555
02:44:05,820 --> 02:44:06,520
Can you do it?

2556
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:07,840
Can you do it? Wait a minute.

2557
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,110


2558
02:44:18,370 --> 02:44:19,370
You are so sexy.

2559
02:44:20,910 --> 02:44:21,910
Oh, no.

2560
02:44:22,670 --> 02:44:23,670
Wait a minute.

2561
02:44:23,870 --> 02:44:24,870
Don't push me.

2562
02:44:26,010 --> 02:44:27,050
I want to go out.

2563
02:44:27,710 --> 02:44:28,710
Do you want to
go slowly? Slowly.

2564
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:29,790


2565
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:35,340
Oh, no!

2566
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:40,730
You are licking my tongue.

2567
02:44:41,490 --> 02:44:42,530
You are cute.

2568
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:46,310
Are you OK?

2569
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,330
Do you want me to do it slowly?

2570
02:44:48,331 --> 02:44:48,810
Yes.

2571
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:50,770
Oh, no!

2572
02:44:51,090 --> 02:44:52,190
Are you OK? It's big.

2573
02:44:53,530 --> 02:44:54,530


2574
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:56,130
Is it big? It's big.

2575
02:44:56,750 --> 02:44:58,451
You said it in an erotic way.

2576
02:44:59,750 --> 02:45:01,730
It's big.

2577
02:45:01,731 --> 02:45:02,731
It's big.

2578
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:04,190
But it feels good.

2579
02:45:04,191 --> 02:45:05,410
I'm glad you got used to it.

2580
02:45:08,430 --> 02:45:09,950
Let me know when you get used to it.

2581
02:45:10,550 --> 02:45:11,550
I got used to it.

2582
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:13,070
You got used to it.

2583
02:45:13,230 --> 02:45:13,310
You are fast.

2584
02:45:14,030 --> 02:45:15,030
Go slowly.

2585
02:45:15,410 --> 02:45:17,190
Oh, no, no, no.

2586
02:45:21,250 --> 02:45:22,250
Oh, no.

2587
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:30,790
Senpai's face looks like a pervert.

2588
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:46,130
She is a mother of three children,
and is also a mother of four children.

2589
02:45:46,131 --> 02:45:46,310
She is the oldest daughter,
who is the oldest in the family.

2590
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:46,430
She is the oldest child, who
is the oldest in the family.

2591
02:45:46,431 --> 02:45:48,010
I'm scared.

2592
02:46:01,130 --> 02:46:02,130
Your legs.

2593
02:46:02,470 --> 02:46:03,470
My legs.

2594
02:46:05,070 --> 02:46:06,350
Are you okay?

2595
02:46:06,570 --> 02:46:06,830
Yes.

2596
02:46:07,430 --> 02:46:08,430
I'm in trouble.

2597
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:19,510
I'm in trouble.

2598
02:46:19,890 --> 02:46:20,890
You're in trouble.

2599
02:46:21,390 --> 02:46:22,390
You're not in trouble.

2600
02:46:23,130 --> 02:46:24,130
What? I'm not.

2601
02:46:24,310 --> 02:46:24,350
I'm in trouble.

2602
02:46:24,890 --> 02:46:26,950


2603
02:46:27,630 --> 02:46:28,870
Are you okay? I feel good.

2604
02:46:29,470 --> 02:46:30,470
I feel good.

2605
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:31,870
I'm in trouble.

2606
02:46:33,010 --> 02:46:36,470
I can't believe it.

2607
02:46:36,471 --> 02:46:38,410
Oh, my God! It's so big.

2608
02:46:39,820 --> 02:46:40,870


2609
02:46:41,810 --> 02:46:42,930
Oh, my God!

2610
02:46:43,470 --> 02:46:54,110
Oh, my God!

2611
02:46:56,410 --> 02:46:57,670
Which one do you feel better?

2612
02:46:57,830 --> 02:47:00,490
You can do it like this,
and you can do it like this.

2613
02:47:00,510 --> 02:47:01,510
Oh, my God!

2614
02:47:02,670 --> 02:47:04,630
You can do it like this,
and you can do it like this.

2615
02:47:04,631 --> 02:47:05,631
Oh, my God! It's difficult.

2616
02:47:05,690 --> 02:47:06,690
It's difficult.

2617
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:08,890
Both of them.

2618
02:47:11,430 --> 02:47:12,430


2619
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:15,210
Both of them look uncomfortable.

2620
02:47:16,630 --> 02:47:17,630
Oh, no.

2621
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:21,160
Oh, no.

2622
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:35,830
Oh, no.

2623
02:47:44,210 --> 02:47:50,790
When he was a baby, he was very tenacious.

2624
02:47:56,210 --> 02:48:00,340
He was the youngest child in the world.

2625
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:04,160
I'm glad he's a good boy.

2626
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:31,940
He's a good boy who's a good boy.

2627
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:34,320
What's this?

2628
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:38,260
Oh my gosh! This is cute.

2629
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:46,310


2630
02:48:57,630 --> 02:49:02,910
She is very picky!

2631
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:23,930
What was that just now?

2632
02:49:24,450 --> 02:49:25,450
It was a normal kiss.

2633
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:13,840
Do you want to do it?

2634
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:19,410
Do you want to see it?

2635
02:50:20,990 --> 02:50:23,410
I want to see it, but I also want to do it.

2636
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:24,850
Which one do you want to do?

2637
02:50:27,090 --> 02:50:28,090
I don't want to do it.

2638
02:50:28,785 --> 02:50:29,985
Senpai, you have a great face.

2639
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:32,430
Senpai, this is a joke.

2640
02:50:36,030 --> 02:50:37,250
I feel sick.

2641
02:50:38,130 --> 02:50:39,270
It's really bad.

2642
02:50:40,670 --> 02:50:42,031
Do you think you can hold
the camera? Yes, I can.

2643
02:50:42,055 --> 02:50:44,670
I'll do my best.

2644
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:49,810
What's wrong?

2645
02:50:50,430 --> 02:50:51,470
Do you have a sore throat?

2646
02:50:53,180 --> 02:50:54,180
My back?

2647
02:50:54,710 --> 02:50:55,710
Your back? It feels good.

2648
02:51:12,130 --> 02:51:15,450


2649
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:16,470
Does it feel good?

2650
02:51:16,471 --> 02:51:17,471
Do you feel good?

2651
02:51:29,010 --> 02:51:30,090
Do you feel good?

2652
02:51:44,450 --> 02:51:45,510
Do you want to touch it?

2653
02:51:46,410 --> 02:51:47,410
I want to touch it.

2654
02:51:48,670 --> 02:51:49,670
Here?

2655
02:51:49,910 --> 02:51:50,910
Here?

2656
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,160
It's easy to touch, isn't it?

2657
02:51:55,570 --> 02:51:56,570
It's easy to touch.

2658
02:51:56,990 --> 02:51:58,490
Do you want to touch it, Senpai?

2659
02:51:58,670 --> 02:51:59,670
I want to touch it.

2660
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:03,310
Do you feel good? It's hot.

2661
02:52:07,860 --> 02:52:09,450
My neck is hot.

2662
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:15,130


2663
02:52:20,410 --> 02:52:32,400
Is it hot? It's hot.

2664
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:47,840
It's hot.

2665
02:53:03,650 --> 02:53:05,910


2666
02:53:06,690 --> 02:53:10,350
Is it hot?

2667
02:53:11,450 --> 02:53:13,090
I think it's overflowing.

2668
02:53:13,870 --> 02:53:28,060
What's wrong?

2669
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:37,880
It's overflowing.

2670
02:53:38,940 --> 02:53:43,540
It's overflowing.

2671
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:46,320
Oh, no!

2672
02:53:50,840 --> 02:53:51,920
Can you suck out the sperm?

2673
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:54,260
I'm still in the urine.

2674
02:53:55,790 --> 02:53:56,990
Do you want me to suck it out?

2675
02:53:57,970 --> 02:53:58,970
Do I suck it out?

2676
02:53:59,380 --> 02:53:59,900
Yes.

2677
02:53:59,901 --> 02:54:00,560
I think I'll suck it out.

2678
02:54:00,561 --> 02:54:00,620
Do I suck it out?

2679
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:02,020
Yes.

2680
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:03,420
What?

2681
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:04,780
What?

2682
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:06,356
What did you think I was doing?

2683
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:07,620
What did you think I was doing?

2684
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:23,280
How is it?

2685
02:54:25,610 --> 02:54:26,610
It's very delicious.

2686
02:54:26,700 --> 02:54:27,500
Is it? It's delicious.

2687
02:54:27,501 --> 02:54:29,080


2688
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:30,480
Really?

2689
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:32,140
Do you eat it?

2690
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:33,660
What?

2691
02:54:34,660 --> 02:54:37,820
Do you eat it? No, I don't.

2692
02:54:39,260 --> 02:54:40,560


2693
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:42,780
What do you want to eat?

2694
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:44,400
This?

2695
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:46,300
Then, I'll take it.

2696
02:54:46,301 --> 02:54:47,621
Let's take a commemorative photo.

2697
02:54:48,530 --> 02:54:49,810
I'll take a commemorative photo.

2698
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:51,760
What's your favorite body part?

2699
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:53,600
What? My favorite body part?

2700
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:55,260
What? I like my back.

2701
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:57,860


2702
02:54:58,000 --> 02:54:59,000
I like my back, too.

2703
02:55:02,880 --> 02:55:07,850
Oh, my God.

2704
02:55:08,970 --> 02:55:12,050
Oh, my God.

2705
02:55:12,610 --> 02:55:12,890
It's easy.

2706
02:55:12,891 --> 02:55:13,891
It's a yoyo.

2707
02:55:15,370 --> 02:55:16,310
It's a yoyo.

2708
02:55:16,311 --> 02:55:17,311
What do you mean? It's a yoyo.

2709
02:55:18,830 --> 02:55:20,530


2710
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:24,030
I have a yoyo in my house.

2711
02:55:24,610 --> 02:55:24,890
What? Neck.

2712
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:26,010


2713
02:55:26,590 --> 02:55:26,910
Neck?

2714
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:28,230
Yes.

2715
02:55:28,810 --> 02:55:29,810
Where is it?

2716
02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:32,210
Hey.

2717
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:33,550
What?

2718
02:55:34,250 --> 02:55:34,550
What?

2719
02:55:35,110 --> 02:55:36,110
What?

2720
02:55:36,890 --> 02:55:38,050
Hey, it's dangerous.

2721
02:55:50,680 --> 02:55:54,450
I'm sorry to hear that.

2722
02:55:54,590 --> 02:55:55,930
I'm sorry to hear that.

2723
02:55:55,970 --> 02:55:58,350
I'm sorry to hear that.

2724
02:55:58,351 --> 02:55:58,650
I'm sorry to hear that.

2725
02:55:58,990 --> 02:56:01,230
What was that?

2726
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:03,090
It's a sweet tooth.

2727
02:56:03,750 --> 02:56:04,750
I'm sorry to hear that.

2728
02:56:19,540 --> 02:56:20,640
It feels good.

2729
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,120
She is 17 years old.

2730
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:49,670
She is very erotic.

2731
02:56:51,390 --> 02:57:09,340
She is very erotic.

2732
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:12,560
Yes, yes, yes.

2733
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:20,090
Oh, no, I'm going to have a nosebleed.

2734
02:57:46,820 --> 02:57:48,460
Oh, my God!

2735
02:57:49,100 --> 02:57:50,000
Oh, my God!

2736
02:57:50,001 --> 02:57:51,001
How are you feeling?

2737
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:52,340
Oh, my God!

2738
02:57:52,360 --> 02:58:03,560
Oh, my God! You are sweating a lot.

2739
02:58:06,150 --> 02:58:07,500
I'm sorry.

2740
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:11,260
Your clothes are dirty.

2741
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:12,360
My clothes? Your clothes.

2742
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:13,460


2743
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:14,860
Really? It's so dirty.

2744
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:16,160


2745
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:17,760
I don't think it's my fault.

2746
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:20,200
It's a mess.

2747
02:58:20,580 --> 02:58:21,580
It's a mess.

2748
02:58:23,470 --> 02:58:29,600
I'm glad.

2749
02:58:31,190 --> 02:58:32,980
It's really painful.

2750
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:35,220
It's a mess.

2751
02:58:35,860 --> 02:58:36,880
It's all over the place.

2752
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:40,260
How are you? I'm fine.

2753
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:42,660


2754
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:47,480
How about you? I'm fine, too.

2755
02:58:48,340 --> 02:58:50,580
That's great.

2756
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:52,060
You are strong.

2757
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:53,800
Look at her.

2758
02:58:54,460 --> 02:58:58,560


2759
02:59:06,130 --> 02:59:07,850
Riko, how are you?

2760
02:59:07,851 --> 02:59:08,851
You guys are so fast.

2761
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:37,231
Senpai... Oh, no!

2762
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:48,240
I'll put my hand on your shoulder.

2763
02:59:48,990 --> 02:59:50,810
Can you take a picture of my face?

2764
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:52,890
It's pretty close.

2765
02:59:53,510 --> 02:59:54,550
How about this?

2766
02:59:55,490 --> 02:59:56,490
Are you okay? Wait a minute.

2767
02:59:56,690 --> 02:59:57,890


2768
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:04,510
Are you scared?

2769
03:00:06,460 --> 03:00:08,130
You are scared,
aren't you? I'm scared.

2770
03:00:22,050 --> 03:00:23,120


2771
03:00:24,780 --> 03:00:28,420
Can I just watch you?

2772
03:00:28,560 --> 03:00:30,260
I want to do it.

2773
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:33,960
Do you want to
do it? It's amazing.

2774
03:00:35,950 --> 03:00:37,160
I'm scared.

2775
03:00:37,161 --> 03:00:38,360
I'm scared.

2776
03:00:57,640 --> 03:01:00,041
I'm getting tired.

2777
03:01:03,850 --> 03:01:06,790
I'm scared.

2778
03:01:08,210 --> 03:01:10,250
What does Senpai look like?

2779
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:13,610
Senpai is smiling.

2780
03:01:15,610 --> 03:01:16,770
Senpai, do you want to do it?

2781
03:01:19,400 --> 03:01:20,400
Do you want
to do it? I'll do it.

2782
03:01:20,510 --> 03:01:21,970
I'm going to do it.

2783
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:23,350
Then, stick out your butt.

2784
03:01:26,850 --> 03:01:29,870
You can raise the camera.

2785
03:01:30,990 --> 03:01:31,990
I'm going to do it.

2786
03:01:37,370 --> 03:01:53,290
I'm sorry.

2787
03:01:58,810 --> 03:01:59,810
It's close.

2788
03:02:00,550 --> 03:02:01,610
It's close.

2789
03:02:01,890 --> 03:02:03,830
Because it's dangerous.

2790
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:14,040
What's wrong?

2791
03:02:16,050 --> 03:02:17,580
I stood on the desk.

2792
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:19,760
Because it was dangerous.

2793
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:22,500
I felt good.

2794
03:02:22,880 --> 03:02:27,280
I felt good, but I thought
it would be too long.

2795
03:02:27,400 --> 03:02:28,740
Yes, it would be too long.

2796
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:31,280
When I noticed it, I stood on the desk.

2797
03:02:32,880 --> 03:02:34,200
You are happy.

2798
03:02:34,201 --> 03:02:35,201
I'm sorry.

2799
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:41,340
Oh, my God.

2800
03:02:41,870 --> 03:02:53,180
Don't tighten yourself and go by yourself.

2801
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:56,000
I'm not tightening.

2802
03:02:56,600 --> 03:02:58,560
Every time you hug
yourself, you say, Oh, my God.

2803
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,320
No, no.

2804
03:03:00,840 --> 03:03:01,840
I'm sorry.

2805
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:07,940
I'm going to go to the hospital.

2806
03:03:09,580 --> 03:03:10,620
I'm going to the hospital.

2807
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:13,260
I'm going to the hospital.

2808
03:03:14,740 --> 03:03:33,800
I'm going to the hospital.

2809
03:03:34,120 --> 03:03:35,160
I'm going to the hospital.

2810
03:03:48,390 --> 03:03:49,630
I'm going to the hospital.

2811
03:03:50,150 --> 03:03:51,630
I'm going to the hospital.

2812
03:03:51,800 --> 03:03:52,970
I'm going to the hospital.

2813
03:03:52,990 --> 03:03:54,070
I'm going to the hospital.

2814
03:03:54,090 --> 03:03:55,790
I'm going to the hospital.

2815
03:03:56,350 --> 03:03:57,390
I'm going to the hospital.

2816
03:03:58,370 --> 03:03:59,410
Oh, no!

2817
03:04:02,010 --> 03:04:04,090
Can we put our faces
side by side? Yes, we can.

2818
03:04:04,310 --> 03:04:06,890
Can I put it on your
face? Yes, you can.

2819
03:04:06,990 --> 03:04:07,990


2820
03:04:14,190 --> 03:04:18,270
Oh, no!

2821
03:04:21,010 --> 03:04:23,030
Oh, no!

2822
03:04:23,031 --> 03:04:24,031
Oh, no!

2823
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:43,730
When I was in the hospital,
I was really surprised.

2824
03:04:45,610 --> 03:04:50,330
I had a surgery and I was
hospitalized for about a year and a half.

2825
03:04:50,331 --> 03:04:51,846
I had a surgery and I was
hospitalized for about a year and a half.

2826
03:04:51,870 --> 03:04:53,750
I was hospitalized for
about a year and a half.

2827
03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:55,230
Where are you going? I'm sorry.

2828
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:57,760


2829
03:04:58,670 --> 03:04:59,710
Oh, no!

2830
03:05:00,770 --> 03:05:01,770
Oh, no!

2831
03:05:02,990 --> 03:05:03,990
Oh, no!

2832
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:06,070
Senpai, please wipe it off.

2833
03:05:06,510 --> 03:05:07,230
Senpai, please wipe it off.

2834
03:05:07,490 --> 03:05:08,070
Senpai, please wipe it off.

2835
03:05:08,071 --> 03:05:09,551
Senpai, are you going to wipe it off?

2836
03:05:09,760 --> 03:05:10,920
Tissue? Isn't it
around here? Maybe.

2837
03:05:11,190 --> 03:05:11,430
Thank you.

2838
03:05:12,210 --> 03:05:12,950
It's here.

2839
03:05:12,990 --> 03:05:13,990
I'm sorry.

2840
03:05:14,530 --> 03:05:15,530
I'm sorry.

2841
03:05:17,730 --> 03:05:18,730
Thank you.

2842
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:21,160


2843
03:05:21,420 --> 03:05:23,340
I can't wear it because
I'm being taken care of.

2844
03:05:23,650 --> 03:05:24,650
I'm wearing a lot.

2845
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:26,030
Give me a tissue.

2846
03:05:26,370 --> 03:05:26,870
I mean, clothes.

2847
03:05:27,270 --> 03:05:27,430
I'm sorry.

2848
03:05:27,810 --> 03:05:28,810
I'm really sorry.

2849
03:05:28,990 --> 03:05:29,410
What? It's true.

2850
03:05:29,790 --> 03:05:31,910
Wait, wait, wait.

2851
03:05:33,050 --> 03:05:33,250
What?

2852
03:05:33,330 --> 03:05:33,870
What?

2853
03:05:33,871 --> 03:05:34,871
Isn't it great?

2854
03:05:35,190 --> 03:05:35,650
What's this?

2855
03:05:35,870 --> 03:05:37,370
There's a lot coming out.

2856
03:05:37,371 --> 03:05:38,851
The president's desk is really scary.

2857
03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:40,530
It's scary.

2858
03:05:40,790 --> 03:05:41,790
It's scary, isn't it?

2859
03:05:43,310 --> 03:05:44,510
Are you okay?

2860
03:05:44,590 --> 03:05:44,870
Can you wipe it off? Yes, I can.

2861
03:05:45,090 --> 03:05:46,090
It's scary.

2862
03:05:48,260 --> 03:05:51,530
Have you ever pressed
the 3-point button?

2863
03:05:51,930 --> 03:05:52,930
Have you?

2864
03:05:53,410 --> 03:05:54,410
What?

2865
03:05:54,630 --> 03:05:55,670
I think you have about 10.

2866
03:05:56,670 --> 03:05:57,670
I don't think so.

2867
03:06:00,810 --> 03:06:01,890
I don't think so.

2868
03:06:03,570 --> 03:06:04,430
Yes, yes, yes.

2869
03:06:04,510 --> 03:06:06,190
After this, let's take a picture together.

2870
03:06:06,370 --> 03:06:07,370
No way!

2871
03:06:07,830 --> 03:06:09,170
How many times have you done it?

2872
03:06:09,610 --> 03:06:10,750
Isn't it amazing? No way.

2873
03:06:11,110 --> 03:06:12,110


2874
03:06:12,450 --> 03:06:14,890
If it's about two or three
times, I'll do it again.

2875
03:06:15,310 --> 03:06:16,310
Really?

2876
03:06:16,530 --> 03:06:17,530
I want to do it.

2877
03:06:18,140 --> 03:06:19,730
I'm not good at this.

2878
03:06:22,330 --> 03:06:24,390
Let's keep it a secret.

2879
03:06:27,450 --> 03:06:29,550
What should I do with this?

2880
03:06:30,350 --> 03:06:31,366
Can I wipe it with a
tissue? It's not good.

2881
03:06:31,390 --> 03:06:32,390


2882
03:06:35,310 --> 03:06:38,450
I'll dry it first.

2883
03:06:39,590 --> 03:06:41,270
If you turn it upside down, it's not good.

2884
03:06:42,790 --> 03:06:43,950
I can do it, can't I?

2885
03:06:45,390 --> 03:06:46,390
Wow!

2886
03:06:46,510 --> 03:06:47,510
How about this? I can do it.

2887
03:06:48,210 --> 03:06:49,550


2888
03:06:49,750 --> 03:06:50,030
Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK.

2889
03:06:50,370 --> 03:06:51,610


2890
03:06:52,770 --> 03:06:53,770
Awesome!
