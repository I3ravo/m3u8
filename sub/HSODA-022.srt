1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,680
It was delicious.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,880
It was delicious.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
It was amazing.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,060
It was my first time to
eat a proper course meal.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,400
I was nervous.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
Me, too.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,780
Was the table manner OK?

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,140
I may have made a mistake, but it was OK.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,160
I see. It was delicious.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,440
Thank you for today.

11
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:36,080
It's been a year since we started dating.

12
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:38,260
I'm glad to hear that.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,100
I'm not used to this look.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,440
What?

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,540
Don't I look good?

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,440
No.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,980
You look great.

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,220
Really?

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,320
You look beautiful today.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,700
Really?

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,880
You look more mature than usual.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,280
You don't usually say that.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,340
It's a little hot.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,940
Is it hot? It's cute.

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,840


26
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,200
Is your necktie bent?

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,140
It's a little bent.

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,940
I'm really happy.

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,360
It's embarrassing.

30
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,841
It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,540
You dropped something.

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,440
What's that?

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,390
Actually, I was going to give
it to you while we were eating.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,810
But I didn't have the courage to do so.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,730
Oh, sorry.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,130
Please marry me.

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,790
Wow, really?

38
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,430
I've never thought about it.

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,870
Really?

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,150
Yes.

41
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,670
Does it mean yes?

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,530
Really? Of course.

43
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,910
That's great.

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,590


45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,741
I was worried about what I
would do if you turned me down.

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,670
Were you that worried?

47
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,450
Yes.

48
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,990
I would never turn you down.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,510
Thank you. I'm so happy.

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,710
I see.

51
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,910
I think it's the right size.

52
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,870
Isn't it too big? It's perfect.

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:00,990
That's great.

54
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,430


55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,970
Thank you so much.

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,210
I was surprised that you
were able to adjust your size.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,550
I'm so happy.

58
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,260
I was so surprised.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm glad.

60
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,800
I was worried about you.

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,440
I was worried about you.

62
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,556
But I've been thinking
about it a lot lately.

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Really?

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,300
I thought it was a little strange.

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,881
I was a little nervous
before, but I thought it

66
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:43,700
was because it was a
restaurant I wasn't used to.

67
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:48,255
I'm so happy.

68
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,400
My dream was to get married.

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,380
Really?

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,180
Do you want to have a
wedding ceremony? Of course.

71
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760


72
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,500
I wanted to wear a dress.

73
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,011
It will definitely suit you.

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Really?

75
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,680
I've gained weight recently,
so I have to lose weight.

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,460
You are beautiful as you are now.

77
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,740
No, I can't show it to you.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,680
I see. You are beautiful at all.

79
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,151
Will you go on a diet
with me? Of course.

80
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,180


81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:23,760
Really?

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,220
Let's do our best together.

83
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,736
I'm looking forward to it.
I want to see your dress soon.

84
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Really?

85
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,850
Will you choose with me?

86
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,560
Yes, if it's okay with me.

87
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Yay!

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,400
You say embarrassing things.

89
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:54,640
I promised not to do
it until we get married.

90
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:06,180
I made a promise to you,
but I don't want to break it now.

91
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,110
But let's break it.

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,830
I've kept my promise so far.

93
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,910
Let's get married a lot.

94
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,670
OK.

95
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,930
I'll keep my promise until then.

96
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,051
I don't know if I can do it.

97
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,730
I don't know.

98
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,071
Then you have to report to your father.

99
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,530
Oh, I see.

100
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,830
Are you okay?

101
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:17,750
When I went to say hello to my
father and mother the other day,

102
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,330
my father was looking
at me with a scary face.

103
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,630
I didn't get angry, but
I was trying, wasn't I?

104
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,950
After that, didn't your father
say anything about me?

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,321
He said you were a good person.

106
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,430
Really? Oh, that would have been nice.

107
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,210
But this time it's a report that you're
getting married, so are you nervous?

108
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,630
No, I'm really nervous.

109
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:46,790
I'm so nervous.

110
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,250
I'm afraid I'll get hit.

111
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,890
My dad used to…

112
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,830
But I've never seen you get hit.

113
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,510
Don't worry.

114
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,990
I see.

115
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,170
I'm so nervous.

116
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,770
Don't worry.

117
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
We're going alone.

118
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,630
I'll do my best.

119
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:10,631
Yes.

120
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,230
I'm nervous.

121
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,550
Why are you nervous?

122
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,930
Because I've never
been to a place like this.

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,170
But you said you would
work hard on your diet with me.

124
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,070
Well, that's right.

125
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,590
But I don't want to leave you.

126
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,730
That's right.

127
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:32,806
I don't want to leave such a person.

128
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,190
That's right.

129
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,590
Am I okay?

130
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,030
No, you're fine.

131
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,031
Oh, really?

132
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,355
What are you worried about?

133
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,930
No, no, I don't know anything.

134
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,330
Excuse me.

135
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,470
Thank you for coming to the concert today.

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,790
Is the cost decided immediately?

137
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,330
Yes.

138
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,750
I'd like to prepare for the wedding.

139
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,590
Congratulations.

140
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
Thank you.

141
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,610
How long do you plan to hold
the wedding? In half a year.

142
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,630


143
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,030
In half a year?

144
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,390
Yes.

145
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,270
Then, we will do our best to hold
a wonderful wedding in half a year.

146
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,250
Thank you for your cooperation.

147
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,690
Thank you for your cooperation.

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,850
Do you have a course?

149
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,710
How many courses
are there? I see.

150
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,570


151
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,670
There is a wedding course, but I
recommend you to have a full body massage.

152
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,020
Then, I will do a full body massage.

153
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,490
I see.

154
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
Is there anything you are worried about?

155
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,430
I am worried about my back.

156
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,890
So, I would like to have
a full body massage.

157
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,350
I'm going to have a check-up.

158
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,750
Oh, I see.

159
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,166
I'll have a check-up on your back.

160
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,190
I see.

161
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,630
I'll have a check-up on your back.

162
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,550
I see.

163
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,370
I'm going to go now.

164
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
I see.

165
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,910
See you later.

166
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,470
Do you have any
allergies? No, I'm fine.

167
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,110


168
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
Oh, you don't have any allergies.

169
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,110
No, I don't.

170
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
I see.

171
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,540
There are so many menus.

172
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,220
Would you like to
have a look? Sure.

173
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,450


174
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,410
I've never been to a hair salon
before, so I don't know much about it.

175
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,450
Have you been to a hair salon before?

176
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,710
It's been a while.

177
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,510
I haven't been to a hair salon
recently, so I don't know much about it.

178
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,702
I think a lot of things
have changed, so if you

179
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:58,810
don't mind, could you
write it down in detail? I see.

180
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,470


181
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,590
I just need to write down the reason.

182
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,830
Oh, I see.

183
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
You can skip the parts
you don't understand.

184
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,130
I see.

185
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:11,010
I'm going to prepare a drink.

186
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,710
Thank you.

187
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
Thank you very much.

188
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,050
It's like a herb.

189
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,550
Yes, it is.

190
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,570
It's more effective when the body warms up.

191
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,690
I see.

192
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,610
It's a strange taste.

193
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,270
Yes, it is.

194
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,410
It's a little warm.

195
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,070
Where did you meet?

196
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,010
When I was a student, I
was in the same class as you.

197
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,630
I see.

198
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,410
Did you date each other
when you were a student?

199
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:28,350
No, I dated him after I
became a member of the board.

200
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,290
It's been a year.

201
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
It's been exactly a year.

202
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,450
It's good that you know each other well.

203
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,210
No, I don't.

204
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,510
I've learned a lot from dating.

205
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,870
I see.

206
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,470
Did you propose
to her? Yes, I did.

207
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,950
I envy you.

208
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,190
I envy you.

209
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,030


210
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,010
It's not a big deal.

211
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,770
I'm glad to hear that.

212
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,610
What attracted you to her?

213
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,850
She is kind and beautiful.

214
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,710
And she is good at cooking.

215
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:28,950
We get along well.

216
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,590
She is cute.

217
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,470
We get along well because we live together.

218
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,570
If we are not on good terms,
we don't come together.

219
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,870
That's right.

220
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,990
Do you have any other questions?

221
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,970
I don't have any.

222
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,130
Do you have any concerns?

223
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,850
This is my first time to come here.

224
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,790
Is it okay?

225
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,610
On the contrary, do you have any concerns?

226
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:04,331
Q. Do you have any advice for
people who have a hard time breathing?

227
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,590
A. I recommend you to hold
your breath even if it hurts.

228
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,860
Q. Do you have any advice for
people who have a hard time breathing?

229
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,610
A. I recommend you to hold
your breath even if it hurts.

230
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:31,590
Q. Do you have any advice for
people who have a hard time breathing?

231
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,390
I'm a little nervous, is that okay?

232
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,630
Why are you so nervous?

233
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,050
Please have a drink.

234
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,230
Thank you.

235
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
It warms me up a little.

236
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,670
It's good.

237
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,040
Are you okay? Are you a
little relaxed? Thank you.

238
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520


239
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,440
My body is getting warmer.

240
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
That's good.

241
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,680
I'm going to use oil for the test, so I'd
like you to hold the machine for a moment.

242
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,150
Your husband is very kind.

243
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,450
Yes, he is. I don't know how
to say it, but he's very kind.

244
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,650
He's got a good vibe.

245
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,990
He's calm.

246
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:56,376
I'm not the type to quarrel

247
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Is he a rich blue? I guess so.

248
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640


249
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,490
My husband told me so.

250
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:20,370
But when I got married, I
found out that he was a nice guy.

251
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,090
Really?

252
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,450
Besides, my husband and
Kanna are absolutely fine.

253
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,690
I think he is a nice guy.

254
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,310
But it's a big decision in my life.

255
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,130
I think so, too.

256
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,490
So I'm a little worried.

257
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:40,070
I think it's okay if
it's just the two of us.

258
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,550
I'll try my best to believe that.

259
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:53,580
It's a little embarrassing.

260
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,176
I didn't know I'd wear something like this.

261
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,780
I know.

262
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,740
I'm afraid I'll be seen.

263
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,140
I'm wearing it, too.

264
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,260
Really?

265
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,760
Yes.

266
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Isn't it embarrassing?

267
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,900
Didn't you have anything
to wear? No, I didn't.

268
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,400


269
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,420
I have a big butt.

270
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,320
Really?

271
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
Yes.

272
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm nervous.

273
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,180
Don't worry. You'll fall asleep.

274
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,680
Can I fall asleep? Yes, you can.

275
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
I see.

276
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Excuse me.

277
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300


278
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,140
Are you ready?

279
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Yes.

280
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,500
This way, please.

281
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm ready.

282
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
I'm ready.

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm ready.

284
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,660
Thank you for coming.

285
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,100
Thank you for coming.

286
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,440
I'm going to start the operation.

287
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Thank you for coming.

288
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,410
Thank you for coming.

289
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,760
It feels so good.

290
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
It's slow, isn't it? Not at all.

291
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,980
I gained weight.

292
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Really?

293
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,760
Yes.

294
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,460
Do you work out?

295
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,720
I go to the gym on Mondays.

296
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,880
I see.

297
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,280
I envy you because you go to the gym.

298
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,640
Don't you go to the gym?

299
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,550
I don't go to the gym.

300
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,820
I've been to the gym,
but I don't go to the gym.

301
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:41,560
But if you can keep it like
that, I think it's good at all.

302
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:51,501
Your skin is
very... It's strange.

303
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,900
It feels like it's well-maintained.

304
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,680
It's getting dry recently.

305
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
It's dry, isn't it?

306
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:58,900
Yes.

307
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:08,540
It feels great.

308
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,950
Your shoulders are a little stiff.

309
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,380
Yes, they are.

310
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,300
It's very easy to get stiff shoulders.

311
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
It's easy to get stiff shoulders
and have a bad posture.

312
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,880
I'm going to increase the pressure here.

313
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,540
First, please sit down.

314
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,110
It feels great.

315
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,440
That's good.

316
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,720
Thank you very much.

317
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,940
Please relax.

318
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,420
The right side is more stiff.

319
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Oh, really?

320
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,300
I'm going to put some pressure on it.

321
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,890
How is it? Does it hurt?

322
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,740
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

323
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,120
It doesn't hurt at all.

324
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:25,650
It was like a part-time job at first, but
when I realized it, it was a full-time job.

325
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,500
Thank you very much.

326
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,860
There are a lot of women, but
there are also couples like this.

327
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,860
It's okay. Please relax.

328
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,861
Please relax.

329
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,820
It may be hard for men, but
we are women, so please relax.

330
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,260
This area is easy to
get lymphatic circulation.

331
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,780
Just by letting the lymph flow,
you can feel your body lighter.

332
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,820
It feels good when I put it on.

333
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,270
It feels good when you put it on.

334
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,720
Was the wedding six months later?

335
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Yes.

336
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,250
Did you decide on the
wedding dress? Yes, I did.

337
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,640


338
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,900
What kind of design is it?

339
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:58,555
It's quite simple.

340
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,440
I can see a little bit of a hole in the
back of the neck and the back of the neck.

341
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
I see.

342
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:09,640
I can see a little bit of a hole in the
back of the neck and the back of the neck.

343
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,641
I see.

344
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,940
It's hard for me to do
it, so I'll give it a try.

345
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,400
I'll do it when I get a full score.

346
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Thank you.

347
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,920
Excuse me.

348
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:27,921
I'm going to start.

349
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,100
It's a strange feeling,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

350
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,520


351
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,590
There is also an expansion effect.

352
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,870
It's getting better.

353
00:22:53,290 --> 00:23:15,330
What is this?

354
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,075
This is a self-healing water.

355
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,290
Oh, I see.

356
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,770
It's like a unique blend.

357
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:35,450
Oh, it's a little different.

358
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,850
Yes, it's a little special.

359
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:53,000
Is the pressure okay?

360
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,001
Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay.

361
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,560


362
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Are you okay?

363
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
Yes.

364
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,310
Then, let's start using the oil.

365
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Yes.

366
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,460
When you use the oil,
this part will get in the way.

367
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,340
Yes.

368
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Can you take it off?

369
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,170
Yes.

370
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,330
I'll leave it here.

371
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,310
This is a mixture of herbal tea and soju.

372
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,020
It's okay. Please relax.

373
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm nervous.

374
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,500
I think it's embarrassing.

375
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,580
It's a nice wedding candy.

376
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,800
I'm going to use this.

377
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,081
I'm going to apply the ointment.

378
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:19,980
It's an important part
because it's connected.

379
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,290
Does it hurt? No, I'm fine.

380
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,230
It's effective.

381
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:51,940


382
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:28,520
I'm going to apply the ointment.

383
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:43,520
It's good to feel that the
oil is soaked into the skin.

384
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,860
Moisturization is also important.

385
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:59,500
Oil is moisturized, so the skin
looks beautiful when it is moisturized.

386
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,720
The tension also comes back.

387
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,961
I'm going to massage your back.

388
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,010
Excuse me.

389
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,990
Please relax.

390
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,340
Excuse me.

391
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Are you okay?

392
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,750
Please sit down.

393
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,420
Is it okay if I sit on your lap?

394
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,230
Yes.

395
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,160
If you don't want to sit,
please raise your legs.

396
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,460
How do you feel?

397
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:30,310
Please open your legs a little.

398
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,770
How do you feel?

399
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,080
It feels so good.

400
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,780
Does it hurt? It feels good.

401
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,280


402
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:16,290
It's embarrassing to be touched.

403
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,250
I don't think there are
many opportunities like this.

404
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:24,350
I don't usually get touched.

405
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,070
Raise this leg, please.

406
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,290
Don't raise it too much.

407
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,690
Okay.

408
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm going to take out the oil.

409
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:03,100
How do you feel here?

410
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:04,101
How do you feel?

411
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,860
I feel very good.

412
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,740
If you press a little harder,
it will be more effective.

413
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,050
What do you do?

414
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Harder?

415
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Yes.

416
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm not good at it.

417
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,420
It's okay. If it hurts, please tell me.

418
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,720
I see. Then I'll do it.

419
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,620
All right.

420
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:29,621
Thank you very much.

421
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Could you wait a moment?

422
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,210
Yes.

423
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Excuse me.

424
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,610
Excuse me.

425
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:02,170
I'd like you to push
the game a little harder.

426
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,430
Could you do that?

427
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,110
OK.

428
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Please relax.

429
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,920
You don't have to be stiff.

430
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,401
It's okay if you don't have any pain.

431
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,820
It's okay if you don't have any pain.

432
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,530
Please let me know if you feel any pain.

433
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,990
Okay.

434
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,170
Excuse me.

435
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,840
Please raise your legs.

436
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:13,760
Okay.

437
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,761
Excuse me.

438
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,060
Excuse me for this side.

439
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,060
Excuse me for this side.

440
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:56,410
Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay.

441
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,150
Please relax.

442
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,510


443
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,526
The pressure point is
not good for your body.

444
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,130
Excuse me.

445
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,651
I'm sorry.
I have a different feeling than usual.

446
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,111
This is a proof that you are relaxed.

447
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,540
Excuse me.

448
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
I'm sorry.

449
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,400
I broke something.

450
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
It's all right.

451
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:54,870
I'm going to cut it.

452
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,010
Excuse me.

453
00:40:57,395 --> 00:40:59,160
Excuse me.

454
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,800
Excuse me.

455
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
I'm sorry.

456
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,280
I'm going to change my clothes.

457
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,010
Oh, I see.

458
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Thank you.

459
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
Thank you.

460
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:15,545
I'm going to use a foil.

461
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,940
Excuse me.

462
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,140
Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay.

463
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,100
I'm relaxing.

464
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180


465
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,890
I've already operated on Mr. Kanna.

466
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:32,830
Yes.

467
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,450
There are a lot of lymph nodes here.

468
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,030
I see.

469
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
The blood flow will be
better if you let it out.

470
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,820
Your skin will be beautiful.

471
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
I see.

472
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,590
Excuse me.

473
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,580
How is the pressure?

474
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
It's just right.

475
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:55,610
Do you massage
like this? Yes, I do.

476
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,390


477
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,930
I can't relax unless I use
my body, such as massage.

478
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,410
I see.

479
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,970
I put on weight.

480
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:09,830
I see.

481
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,350
Excuse me.

482
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,350
Yes.

483
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:46,351
Okay.

484
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:20,540
It's pretty stiff.

485
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,720
Oh, I was told so earlier.

486
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Oh, really?

487
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,860
I'm going to focus on loosening it.

488
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,940
I understand.

489
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,560
Did it hurt?

490
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,320
No, I put my hand in my pants.

491
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,681
Is there anything you want to say?

492
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:46,016
Well, there is no meaning
if I say it from the top.

493
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,040
Oh, is that so? Directly.

494
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

495
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,680
I was a little surprised.

496
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,720
Excuse me.

497
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Yes.

498
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

499
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,050
I'm sorry.

500
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:29,830
It's okay.

501
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,270
Is it okay?

502
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,330
Yes.

503
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,470
I'm sorry.

504
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,401
Well, it's a common thing.

505
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,131
It's a sign that you are relaxed.

506
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,760
It's all right.

507
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,990
It's all right?

508
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,870
Wait, wait, wait.

509
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,940
It's all right.

510
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,400
It's all right, isn't it?

511
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,140
Yes, it's all right.

512
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,740
It's not good for your body to be stiff.

513
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
Wait, wait, wait.

514
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,860
It's pretty stiff, so
I'm going to loosen it.

515
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,140
No, that's a little...

516
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,520
It's okay, it's okay.

517
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,220
Please relax.

518
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,321
No, but... It's relaxing.

519
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,460
I have a girlfriend next
to me, so it's a little...

520
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,000
It's okay, I can't see it.

521
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,490
No, but...

522
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,200
I'm going to loosen it.

523
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:06,780
I'm going to apply a little more oil.

524
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:11,640
Do you want more oil?

525
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:14,960
That's not what I meant.

526
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,600
Wait a minute.

527
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,200
Please relax.

528
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:35,560
She told me to stop.

529
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,580
It's okay. Just relax.

530
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:49,070
No, it's a little... It's okay.

531
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,110
No, it's not okay.

532
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,640
It's okay.

533
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,890
It's not a massage,
is it? It's a massage.

534
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,090
It's very stiff, isn't it?

535
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,230
This is strange.

536
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,170
You have to loosen it.

537
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,730
No, I'm scared.

538
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:31,620
I'm scared.

539
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,460
It's okay.

540
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,700
Please relax.

541
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

542
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,700
What's wrong?

544
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:06,740
Please don't do that.

545
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,720
It's all right.

546
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,580
I'll keep it a secret from you.

547
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,880
But...

548
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
By the way,

549
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,360
Kanna-san is very relaxed.

550
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,210
What do you mean?

551
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,940
This is a magic mirror.

552
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,640
From the other side, it's a mirror.

553
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:37,970
You can't see this side.

554
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,540
Do you want to see?

555
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:52,480
What are you doing?

556
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:52,540
Are you okay? I'm okay.

557
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,660
I can't see this side.

558
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,360
No, that's not what I mean.

559
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,720
Because...

560
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,520
Please stop.

561
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,920
Please relax.

562
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,340
Please let me stop.

563
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:07,800
What are you doing?

564
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,100
But I'm relaxing.

565
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,500
What? That's strange.

566
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Relax, relax.

567
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,660
I'm okay.

568
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,420
I'm sorry.

569
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:17,421


570
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,760
Please don't do that.

571
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,860
Why are you doing this?

572
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,450
It's for your beauty.

573
00:51:32,105 --> 00:51:34,760
No, I mean...

574
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,640
Please don't do that.

575
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
It's terrible.

576
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,640
You're getting stiff
while saying such a thing.

577
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:53,330
Do you do such a thing? It's strange.

578
00:51:56,495 --> 00:52:01,190
But you don't get sick at all while
saying such a thing, do you? No, I don't.

579
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,930
Please relax.

580
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:05,230


581
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,390
What's wrong?

582
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,130
Do you want to add some oil?

583
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,360
No, it's enough.

584
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,710
Please stop.

585
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,730
You're doing this while
saying such a thing.

586
00:52:43,685 --> 00:52:45,670
You're getting harder and harder.

587
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,770
I don't want to.

588
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,850
I don't want to see her like this.

589
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:50,810
But you can't see it.

590
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,430
What are you doing?

591
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,910
You don't want to be
seen, do you? No, I don't.

592
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,690


593
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,270
I'm kissing you.

594
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,750
Why are you kissing me?

595
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,010
I'm kissing you.

596
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,310
No way.

597
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,390
That's impossible.

598
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,450
Your skin is very hard.

599
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:21,630
Are you usually in the middle?

600
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,810
No, I don't do such a thing.

601
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:34,760
You have a very beautiful face.

602
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,840
You have a very erotic face.

603
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:26,350
I want you to touch me more and more.

604
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:56,510
This side feels good, right?

605
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:29,100
This is the first time I've ever seen
Kana-san in such a costume, and it's amazing.

606
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,370
Kana-san, you look great in that costume.

607
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:43,870
It's strange. What do you mean?

608
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,090
You look like you're asking for it.

609
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,430
It's not like that.
I would never do such a thing.

610
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:52,650
Have you ever done
such a thing? No, I haven't.

611
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,670


612
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:57,671
I would never do such a thing.

613
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,010
No, I would never do such a thing.

614
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:04,590
Then, please look at me.

615
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,490
What are you talking about?

616
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,930
How relaxed you are.

617
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,030
Please look at me.

618
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:14,031
Excuse me.

619
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,190
Excuse me.

620
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,880
Kanna-san.

621
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,680
How do you feel? It's heavy.

622
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,960


623
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,960
You can lick as much as you want.

624
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,800
Excuse me.

625
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,980
It's amazing.

626
00:57:58,981 --> 00:57:59,981
It's amazing,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

627
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:01,870


628
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,770
It's getting harder than
before, isn't it? Yes, it is.

629
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,330


630
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,626
Kanna-san, you don't
put up with it so much.

631
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,650
Tetsuya-san, you put up
with it, don't you? No, I don't.

632
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,130


633
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:30,130
It's amazing, isn't it?

634
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,230
Is it funny?

635
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,130
I can't help laughing at you, Tetsuya-san.

636
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,190
Tetsuya-san...

637
00:58:54,815 --> 00:58:56,490
Wait a minute.

638
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,491
I'm sorry.

639
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:59,490
Do you want to quit?

640
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,910
She's been doing it for a long time.

641
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,430
It's not fair.

642
00:59:07,431 --> 00:59:08,910
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

643
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:47,380
Do you always lick her so meanly?

644
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,280
I've never had sex with her.

645
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,360
You haven't had sex?

646
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,260
I decided not to do it until
I die, so I'm taking a break.

647
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,740
But I'm licking the house of
someone other than Tetsuya.

648
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,040
Please don't say that.

649
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,950
It's amazing. It's already full.

650
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,360
While looking at Kanna, think
that you are being licked by Kanna.

651
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,680
What are you talking about?

652
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,080
Oh, my stomach is growling.

653
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,700
You don't want to put up with
it anymore, do you? No, I don't.

654
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,020


655
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:48,120
If you haven't had sex with your girlfriend
yet, do you want to do it with me?

656
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:52,700
Wait a minute.
You won't let her do it, will you?

657
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,480
No, it's something we've decided.

658
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:00,360
It's something you've decided,
but she's betraying you first.

659
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,200
I can't stand it anymore.

660
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:13,480
Have you ever seen
her boobs? No, I haven't.

661
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:16,720


662
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,640
Have you seen other people's boobs
since you started dating? No, I haven't.

663
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,340


664
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,740
Why are you taking it off?

665
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,440
It's a waste if I don't
touch other people's boobs.

666
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:37,441
Don't touch me.

667
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,320
Your breast is being
touched by someone else.

668
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
Don't say such a thing.

669
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,230
I have a girlfriend.

670
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,700
Don't say such a thing.

671
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,080
But she is with someone else.

672
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
What are you doing?

673
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
What are you doing?

674
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,760
Don't you have sex?

675
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,540
You're doing such a bad
thing, aren't you? Stop it.

676
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,660


677
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,240
What a terrible thing.

678
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,360
You're so afraid of yourself.

679
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,040
No, I'm not.

680
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,161
I'm not that kind of person.

681
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,520
Maybe I did something strange.

682
01:03:34,521 --> 01:03:35,641
Did you do something
to her? No, I didn't.

683
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,480


684
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:45,220
She always wanted to have a
baby, didn't she? No, I didn't.

685
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:46,960


686
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,760
She's not that kind of person.

687
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,080
She's a big girl.

688
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,981
She's got a baby in her belly.

689
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,191
Put your hands together like this.

690
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,781
Tetsuya-san, you've been holding
it in for a long time, haven't you?

691
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,610
Make your hands hard.

692
01:04:18,345 --> 01:04:20,300
Please, this time...

693
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,980
You keep saying, please stop, but
you don't let go of your hands at all.

694
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:32,220
Actually, I wanted to have a
normal relationship with you.

695
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:40,280
I don't want to have a relationship
with anyone other than my girlfriend.

696
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,520
How long have you
been dating? One year.

697
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800


698
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,320
One year, right?

699
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,640
You haven't had sex for a year?

700
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,120
No.

701
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,380
Ta-da!

702
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,540
Wait, wait, wait.

703
01:04:56,535 --> 01:04:58,500
You haven't seen this room for a year?

704
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
Hey!

705
01:05:04,185 --> 01:05:07,600
You haven't touched or licked here?

706
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,560
I haven't done such a thing.

707
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,440
Oh, well.

708
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
Give me your hand.

709
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,760
If I don't drink this water,

710
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,320
Hanna-san won't be satisfied.

711
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,820
What do you mean?

712
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:49,150
I want to drink more.

713
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,450
I want to vomit more.

714
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,450
I have to vomit.

715
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:01,350
I'm going to put you in my arms forever.

716
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:19,250
I love you, Guri.

717
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:35,670
I'm sorry.

718
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:36,671
Oh, it feels good.

719
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:05,060
I'm not crying, I'm not crying.

720
01:07:05,061 --> 01:07:07,180
No, no, no.

721
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,340
Then, I don't have to
put it in? No, no, no.

722
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:15,300


723
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,660
If you do that, you'll betray her.

724
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,730
Betray? Then, look.

725
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,740


726
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,420
Who is betraying?

727
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,400
Are you sure?

728
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:37,880
You may not be able
to have sex from now on.

729
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,980
I'll warm you up.

730
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:48,920
Are you okay?

731
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,220
Do you feel you are being
licked by another man?

732
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:06,180
I can't take it anymore.

733
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,090
Please put it in.

734
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,380
May I?

735
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,801
My husband is sleeping over there.

736
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Please put it in.

737
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,400
Okay.

738
01:08:31,995 --> 01:08:32,995
Oh, my.

739
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:35,670
Oh, my.

740
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,110
Oh, my.

741
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,070
Are you okay?

742
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:06,830
Yes.

743
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,280
You are like this.

744
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:14,390
Even though I am massaging your head.

745
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,860
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

746
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,980
It's okay, isn't it?

747
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:36,820
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

748
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:38,520
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

749
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:42,580
She's a terrible actress.

750
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,280
She's a terrible actress.

751
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,980
Why did you do that?

752
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:47,981
Are you tired?

753
01:09:50,715 --> 01:09:56,620
You say it's terrible, but you're so tired.

754
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,480
I'm a little scared.

755
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Look at my nose.

756
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,520
No, I don't want to see it.

757
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,020
Look at my nose.

758
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,560
No, I don't want to see it.

759
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,440
Oh, it's getting harder inside.

760
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,480
Stop, please stop.

761
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,060
Can I stop?

762
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,290
Then, please look at each other.

763
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,830
The one with her and the one inside.

764
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,550
It's like having sex with your
girlfriend, isn't it? No, it's not.

765
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,550


766
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:14,040
It's like having sex with a girl.

767
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,660
I'm so sorry.

768
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:23,260
I'm so scared.

769
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:46,910
You can do whatever you want.

770
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,460
I'm so sorry.

771
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,240
I'm sorry.

772
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,200
I'm sorry.

773
01:12:30,201 --> 01:12:31,241
Please look at the camera.

774
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,180
Can you see me?

775
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,900
I can see you very well.

776
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,560
Please come closer.

777
01:13:22,100 --> 01:14:43,180
Please come closer.

778
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:34,290
※This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

779
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,390
What do you want
me to do? Oh, my God.

780
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:36,940
I feel so good.

781
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:56,600
I'm sorry.

782
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:14,025
Oh, my God.

783
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:17,390
I'm so excited.

784
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:04,171
What's wrong? I'm so excited.

785
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,350
I'm so excited.

786
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,450


787
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:09,770
You're always lying.

788
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,030
You're so excited.

789
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,040
You said you weren't excited.

790
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,720
There's a lot in there.

791
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:53,160
Your girlfriend is looking at you a lot.

792
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,000
Please stop it.

793
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:01,720
Are you going to stop it?

794
01:18:01,721 --> 01:18:02,721
Are you okay?

795
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,720
She is sleeping.

796
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,480
She is shivering inside.

797
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:36,230
Do you want to be
violent like your girlfriend?

798
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:37,231
Are you okay?

799
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,940
You have a nasty face.

800
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,420
I can see it well.

801
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,290
You have the same attitude as other people.

802
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,400
Hey!

803
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,920
I'm sorry, my son.

804
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,640
You're such a lovely boy.

805
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:37,260
No, no, please stop.

806
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:41,340
You're such a bad boy.

807
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:42,500
You're happy, aren't you?

808
01:20:58,530 --> 01:20:59,530
You're excited, saying, Stop it.

809
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:00,830
No, I'm not.

810
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:04,610
Stop it.

811
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:05,750
I'm sorry.

812
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:25,750
I'm sorry.

813
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,430
I'm sorry.

814
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:36,590
I'm sorry.

815
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,470
I'm sorry.

816
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,980


817
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,980
Did you take it out of your stomach?

818
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,180
Let me see your stomach.

819
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,710
You took it out so much.

820
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:04,290
You have a lot in your stomach.

821
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,850
Excuse me.

822
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:32,750
Do you have a stomachache?

823
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:39,450
I'll give you a special massage.

824
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,260
Oh! It feels good.

825
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,320


826
01:28:14,845 --> 01:29:18,690
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying in the water.

827
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:35,240
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat in a bath.

828
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:35,300
I was surprised to see a cat in
a bath for the first time in my life.

829
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:42,080
I was surprised to see a cat in
a bath for the first time in my life.

830
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,161
I was surprised to see a cat in
a bath for the first time in my life.

831
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,010
I don't know.

832
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:01,650
It's up to you.

833
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,080
She is very sensitive
to the sound of water.

834
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:16,690
So she uses a water purifier.

835
01:32:16,691 --> 01:32:17,691
She is a very gentle cat.

836
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:36,790
She is very gentle when she wakes up.

837
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,310
She is a very gentle cat.

838
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:58,510
Oh, it feels good.

839
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,670
Oh, it's hot.

840
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:01,670
Oh, it feels good.

841
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:05,830
Oh, it's hot.

842
01:35:06,975 --> 01:35:11,730
Oh, it's hot.

843
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:35,140
Oh, it feels good.

844
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,880
Oh, my back.

845
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:49,240
Oh, it feels good.

846
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:29,390
Oh, no!

847
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:30,870
Oh, no!

848
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,050
Oh, no!

849
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:40,670
Oh, no!

850
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,970
Oh, no!

851
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,160
Oh, no!

852
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,130
Oh, no!

853
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,460
Oh, no!

854
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:53,980
Oh, no!

855
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:54,940
Ah, it felt good.

856
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:24,181
Would you like to come again?

857
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,430
Yes, I'll come again.

858
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:57,840
Are you okay?

859
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,360
Are you depressed?

860
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:05,920
Can you leave her alone?

861
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,800
I can't leave her alone.

862
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,720
Look at this video.

863
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:19,931
Did you just take this
video? She can't wait.

864
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,100


865
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,500
She's waiting for you.

866
01:41:40,501 --> 01:41:46,680
She is shaking her hips.

867
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:53,400
She is shaking her hips.

868
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,280
She is shaking her hips.

869
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:13,420
She is shaking her hips so much that
she is worried about the hospital bill.

870
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:21,500
What's wrong with you?

871
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:32,240
Are you excited to see this video?

872
01:42:32,241 --> 01:42:33,241
Really?

873
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:47,420
If you do that, your girlfriend
will leave you after marriage.

874
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:49,980
Shut up! It's our fault.

875
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:55,060


876
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,840
It's all our fault.

877
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:14,720
It's not our fault, is it?

878
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:22,960
It's all because we
don't satisfy your desires.

879
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:23,961
You shouldn't do that.

880
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,700
Are you okay?

881
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,880
You shouldn't do that.

882
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,580
How many times do I
have to do this? I'm sorry.

883
01:44:21,581 --> 01:44:22,581


884
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:48,100
She's been here all the time.

885
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:58,960
Slurp! Slurp!

886
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:04,480
Ah, ah, ah, that's it.

887
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,100
That's it, that's it.

888
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:13,180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

889
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:27,840
She might be saying a lot like me, too.

890
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:37,624
I may not be able to
be satisfied with such

891
01:45:37,636 --> 01:45:42,800
a wrinkled penis because
I had such a penis.

892
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,000
It's hot!

893
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,120
I didn't know her pussy was this hard.

894
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,800
I can't be satisfied with that.

895
01:47:18,825 --> 01:47:24,240
That's right, you have to lick it more.

896
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:53,460
Hmm!

897
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:56,520
Ah!

898
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,280
Ah!

899
01:48:01,281 --> 01:48:01,400
Ah!

900
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,600
Hmm!

901
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:06,800
Hmm!

902
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,460
Ah!

903
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:09,420
Ah!

904
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:11,140
Your left hand is resting.

905
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:13,440
Hmm!

906
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,320
Hmm!

907
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,520
Hmm!

908
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,300
Oh, my God.

909
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:59,880
It's intense, isn't it?

910
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

911
01:49:04,301 --> 01:49:11,220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

912
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:21,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

913
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:30,430
My girlfriend might
be in the back, like this.

914
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:49,280
You can't satisfy me with that.

915
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:56,840
I need to make it harder.

916
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:18,000
You have to make her feel good.

917
01:51:19,830 --> 01:51:21,271
You have to make yourself feel good.

918
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:07,254
This is the first time
I've ever had a baby, so

919
01:52:07,266 --> 01:52:11,740
I'm a little nervous, but
I'm going to do my best.

920
01:52:11,741 --> 01:52:14,500
Masa-san, are you having sex now?

921
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,440
Are you satisfied with just licking me?

922
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,020
If you want me to say, say it.

923
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:37,660
If you want me to be depressed, say it.

924
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:43,100
Oh, my nose.

925
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:59,600
If I don't put a lot of it in
here, I'll feel like I'm satisfied.

926
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:52,420
It's not our fault.

927
01:53:52,421 --> 01:54:01,160
No, it's not. It's not our fault.

928
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:17,700
I'm not satisfied with myself and
Mango, so I have to leave it as it is.

929
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:48,320
※It is not a sound effect.

930
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:40,130
It's amazing, isn't it?

931
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,000
I'm going to sleep.

932
01:56:44,775 --> 01:56:49,770
Oh my god! It's so hard.

933
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:54,890
I'm so sorry.

934
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:58,270
I made you so nervous.

935
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,670
I made you cry, didn't I?

936
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,370
Are you satisfied with just one visit?

937
01:57:10,975 --> 01:57:13,450
She's been to so many places.

938
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:49,650
〔Crying and panting〕
You look good.

939
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:59,150


940
01:58:00,770 --> 01:58:01,110
〔Laughing〕

941
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:04,090
You look better than when you came here.

942
01:58:04,091 --> 01:58:05,091
I'm going to bite you.

943
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:11,410
Your face is going to be bitten.

944
01:58:40,190 --> 01:58:47,830
It's good.
It's good for your body to feel good.

945
01:59:58,961 --> 01:59:59,961
Ah!

946
02:00:21,505 --> 02:00:24,400
I've got so many pimples.

947
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,900
I don't know what to do
with a woman I don't know.

948
02:01:04,110 --> 02:01:10,740
You're such a bad groom,
putting me in such a mess.

949
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,520
What are you going to do?

950
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:29,280
I think I can still do it.

951
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:31,640
Can you?

952
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:55,320
I can still do it, but what should I do?

953
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:11,830
It's not enough, isn't it?

954
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:18,880
What are you going
to do? I'm ready.

955
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:23,850


956
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:18,350
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

957
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:34,900
It's hard, isn't it?

958
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,740
You can do such a violent thing.

959
02:06:51,131 --> 02:06:52,370
I'm sorry.

960
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:02,850
Please pour more.

961
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:07,390
I've saved up so far.

962
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:52,400
「」「」

963
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:17,570
It's hot! It's hot!

964
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:19,930
It's hot!

965
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:21,410
It's hot!

966
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:04,540
You had a lot of fun, didn't you?

967
02:11:20,170 --> 02:11:29,180
I hope you'll bring your girlfriend again.

968
02:11:29,181 --> 02:11:30,421
It's okay if you don't like it.

969
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:43,640
I'll be waiting for you.

970
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:49,250
Let's have fun again.

971
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:05,730
How was it?

972
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,280
ST, how was it? It was good.

973
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:11,300


974
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:12,990
Was it good?

975
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:13,630
Yes.

976
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:15,230
How was it? I'm glad.

977
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,410


978
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:21,260
You are glad, aren't
you? Yes, I am.

979
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:22,770


980
02:12:25,890 --> 02:12:26,990
You will come again.

981
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:36,860
Really? Yes, anytime.

982
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:38,320


983
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:43,770
Shall we go? Yes, let's go.
