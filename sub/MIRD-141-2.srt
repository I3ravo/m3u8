1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is a lotion bath.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We will show you the feeling of a bath.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is a bubble bath.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Please wash your body and body.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then, please choose which one you like.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please come in!

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's do it cleanly.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Awawa! Awawa!

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Awawa! Awawa!

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is GingGing.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's getting bigger.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's put it on the butt.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, great! Ochi-Ochi is already big, isn't it?

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, my God!

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, my God!

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, my God!

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, my God!

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, my God!

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Avro is the best!

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Isn't it?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's so cute.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to cut it.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It feels good.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's so cute.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It feels good.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Look at this.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's so soft.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm good at it.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you tired?

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's okay.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh no!

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go to another place.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go to another place.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh no!

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh no! My neck.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, no.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can't hold it anymore.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go over there.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Over there.

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can I take a bath?

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Is it dangerous?

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm so happy.

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't touch me.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm so happy.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm so happy.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you okay?

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm okay.

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm so happy.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's fun, isn't it?

51
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ah, it's so cold.

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll wipe it for you.

53
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's go outside.

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's so cold.

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm so sorry.

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm so sorry.

57
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
More, more, more!

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:38,000
More, more, more!

59
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to sleep a lot!

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I got a lot!

61
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I got a lot!

62
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm so happy!

63
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Look at this.

64
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's go!

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, it's coming out!

66
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, it's coming out!

67
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait, wait!

68
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, don't, don't!

69
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No!

70
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't.

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Look outside.

72
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really?

73
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Should I take it out?

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's go.

75
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm scared.

76
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It came out of the mat.

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, it feels good.

78
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, it's coming out.

79
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It came out.

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Today is the second time.

82
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't do it anymore.

84
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

85
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

86
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ah! Ah!

87
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ah, I'm sorry!

88
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ah, it feels so good.

89
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ah, it's so painful!

90
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ah, it's painful!

91
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ah, it's dangerous!

92
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Ah!

93
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Ah, it's amazing!

94
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Ah, it's painful!

95
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Ah!

96
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Look at my eyes.

97
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Look at my eyes.

98
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm scared.

99
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Did you fall asleep?

100
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Did you fall asleep?

101
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm scared.

102
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He is licking his buttocks.

103
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He is licking his buttocks.

104
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He is taking a nap.

105
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Can I put it in?

106
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It looks like it's going to work.

107
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's warm.

108
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
When did you hit me?

109
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm so happy.

110
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It came out.

111
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I did it.

112
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That was great.

113
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Gin-chan is coming.

114
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Gin-chan is coming.

115
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm so scared!

116
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm so tired.

117
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm so tired.

118
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What's wrong?

119
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm scared.

120
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, amazing.

121
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's really slippery.

122
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Amazing.

123
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,380
Katsuragi-kun, come here.

124
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,420
Oh, Katsuragi-saki!

125
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Oh, oh, oh!

126
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Oh, nice!

127
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Oh, oh, oh!

128
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Oh, oh, oh!

129
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Oh, he's coming!

130
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
He's coming!

131
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Oh, he's so cute!

132
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Oh, he's so cute!

133
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Oh, oh, oh!

134
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Oh, oh, oh!

135
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Oh, oh, oh!

136
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
What's wrong with you?

137
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
I knew it was no good.

138
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
What are you doing?

139
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
I don't want to.

140
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I don't want to.

141
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Oh! Oh! Oh!

142
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm sorry!

143
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm sorry!

144
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Oh, no!

145
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Oh, no! Oh, no!

146
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Did you get it?

147
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Are you ready?

148
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Are you surprised?

149
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
It's hard, isn't it?

150
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
I don't know, I don't know.

151
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Hey, Mai.

152
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Yes?

153
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
What did you say?

154
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
I just said it.

155
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Hey, glasses.

156
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Glasses.

157
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
It's scary.

158
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
You're a coward.

159
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
How many are there today?

160
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Two.

161
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Two?

162
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Is it not allowed?

163
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I want to see more.

164
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
That's next to it.

165
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Next to it?

166
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Which one?

167
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
It's next to it.

168
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
It's hiding in the shade.

169
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Where is it hiding?

170
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
It's hiding in the shade.

171
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
2.5?

172
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
It's running away.

173
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
It's running away.

174
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Don't worry.

175
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm sorry.

176
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Stop it!

177
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
What did you say?

178
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm sorry.

179
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
You should say that it's not good.

180
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Stop it!

181
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
It's not good.

182
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm sorry.

183
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I'm sorry.

184
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Look at me.

185
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Stop it!

186
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Stop it!

187
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Stop it!

188
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Stop it!

189
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Stop it!

190
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Good boy!

191
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Good boy!

192
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Good boy!

193
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Good boy!

194
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Ah, it feels good.

195
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Ah, it feels good.

196
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Ah, it's dangerous.

197
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Ah, it hurts more.

198
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Amazing!

199
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Oh, it came out.

200
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
I'm sorry.

201
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
I'm sorry.

202
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
It's hard.

203
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
I'm sorry.

204
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Are you okay?

205
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
It feels good.

206
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
It's scary.

207
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
It's scary.

208
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Ah, I'm so scared!

209
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I can't get up yet.

210
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm sorry.

211
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
I'm sorry.

212
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
It's hard.

213
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Move!

214
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
I'm a old man.

215
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm sorry.

216
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
It's okay.

217
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I'm so sorry.

218
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Oh my God.

219
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
It's okay.

220
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
It's okay.

221
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
I'm fine.

222
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Come here.

223
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I'm sorry.

224
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
30 seconds left.

225
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Give me your tail.

226
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Tail.

227
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Here, tail.

228
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
She is crying.

229
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
She is feeling good.

230
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
She is closing her eyes.

231
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Is she closing her eyes?

232
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
She is going to close her eyes.

233
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
She is going to close her eyes.

234
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
She is going to close her eyes.

235
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:48,920
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

236
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Go!

237
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,920
There's no more sheep!

238
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,920
I'll pet the sheep for you.

239
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Everyone, come in here.

240
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
The end.

241
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
The end.

242
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Come here.

243
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Come here.

244
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Come here.

245
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
If you are looking forward to it,

246
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
if you are not looking forward to it,

247
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
come here.

248
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Come here.

249
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Come here.

250
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
I'm scared.

251
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
I'm scared.

252
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
It's intense.

253
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
It's intense.

254
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Let's go this way.

255
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
It's really scary.

256
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Thank you.

257
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Come here.

258
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
It's a little scary.

259
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
It's scary.

260
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
This is the place that I stand out the most.

261
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
All right.

262
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Let the children go forward.

263
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Everyone is looking forward to it.

264
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Master!

265
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Master!

266
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Cool!

267
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,480
How many times did you cast this time?

268
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
I do not know.

269
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Did you cast?

270
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Oh!

271
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
It's amazing!

272
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
It's amazing, isn't it?

273
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,480
There may be one more time with this momentum.

274
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Really?

275
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Please look forward to it.

276
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
That's all.

277
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
It was Tomohiro Tomohiro in the bath.

278
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Sparkle basketball.

279
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Sparkle basketball.

280
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
It's hot.

281
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
It's really hot.

282
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
It's hot.

283
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,480
How many shots did you take?

284
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
One shot only.

285
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
How was it?

286
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
It was close.

287
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Can you move away?

288
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Excuse me.

289
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
I found a very big person.

290
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Was there a very big person?

291
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Yes.

292
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Excuse me.

293
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
How many shots did you take?

294
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,480
It was the first time I was in the military.

295
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
The second time?

296
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
I don't know.

297
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
I went out twice today.

298
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
The second time.

299
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
The second time?

300
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
I didn't go out.

301
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
What did you go out?

302
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
The second time.

303
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I went out twice.

304
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Hata-no-san.

305
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Yes.

306
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Hata-no-san.

307
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
How was it?

308
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
That one.

309
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
That's right.

310
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
It was the first time.

311
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,480
But the other members came in the middle of it.

312
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Oh, right!

313
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
They thought I was busy.

314
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
That's right.

315
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
They changed my bag.

316
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
It was no good.

317
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
I'm happy.

318
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
I'll put Aichi in.

319
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Aichi.

320
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Really?

321
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Aichi, you're really tight.

322
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
It's a girl!

323
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
It's a girl!

324
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
No!

325
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
It's a girl!

326
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
It's a girl!

327
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
No!

328
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
I can't stop bleeding!

329
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
It hurts!

330
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Let me help you.

331
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Wait!

332
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
You made me cry.

333
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Thank you.

334
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
It's 10.40.

335
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,680
I am the president and Head of the House

336
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,460
I am the head of this shop

337
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,380
right

338
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,620
A drifter

339
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,120
Steering field

340
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,620
Hi, Lead konstruction

341
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,160
Is there anyone who thinks of me as a drifter?

342
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
I don't think so.

343
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
That's a good one.

344
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
What happened?

345
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I don't know.

346
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
I don't know.

347
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
By the way,

348
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
what is the team like?

349
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
We are

350
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
from your team.

351
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
We are the ones

352
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
who will dominate.

353
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Thank you.

354
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
I think you're cute.

355
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Thank you.

356
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Is there anything about me that is cute?

357
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Yes, there is.

358
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I'm a little happy.

359
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Hey.

360
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I would like to announce the results of this competition.

361
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,320
Anyway, both teams are very good

362
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,460
They can run super fast

363
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,800
That's really a great asset

364
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,280
They can perform outside of the box

365
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,740
so you will control they better

366
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,740
One more issue

367
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,740
I haven't seen your video yet

368
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,740
I don't know

369
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,740
I think so

370
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
How do you feel?

371
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
I don't know

372
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,740
I don't know

373
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
You don't know?

374
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
I don't know

375
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,740
You didn't show me your video

376
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
I don't know

377
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
It's a joke

378
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:18,740
So, I want you to practice with the feeling of launching

379
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,740
Let me go

380
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,740
Stand up

381
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Look at your face

382
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,740
Say hello

383
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,740
Say hello?

384
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,740
Come here

385
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,740
Say hello

386
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,740
What is your name?

387
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
Shin

388
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Let's change the name.

389
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Let's do that.

390
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,740
It's not good.

391
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,740
I don't want to do it.

392
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
I understand.

393
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Is it Oji-gi?

394
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
Yes.

395
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Oji-gi.

396
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
Thank you.

397
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Thank you.

398
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,740
It's strange.

399
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
You don't like it, do you?

400
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
Yes, I don't like it.

401
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
I don't like it.

402
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Then.

403
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
It's mixed.

404
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,740
It's mixed.

405
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
Go ahead, Kaz.

406
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740
Thank you.

407
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,740
Excuse me.

408
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
Wait, that was Chinko, wasn't it?

409
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Welcome.

410
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,740
So, we're going to have some fun in the next scene.

411
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Please use it more and more.

412
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
Thank you. Please look forward to it.

413
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Thank you for your hard work.

414
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
Let's go home now.

415
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Have a nice day.

416
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Katsu-kun, you know what to do, right?

417
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
Yes.

418
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
You know what to do, right?

419
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
Yes.

420
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Do your best.

421
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Thank you for your hard work.

422
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,740
You know what to do, right?

423
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
You know what to do, right?

424
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
You know what to do, right?

425
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
Katsu-san, go!

426
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
I don't want to drink either.

427
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
I'm not going to put it in.

428
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
I didn't put it in, so I was a little surprised.

429
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
By the way,

430
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
It's amazing.

431
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
From now on,

432
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,740
It's a little bit of a challenge.

433
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Oh, line up.

434
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
I'm going to put it in.

435
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
I think it's working.

436
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Yes, it's working.

437
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
Is it working?

438
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Yes, it is.

439
00:38:32,280 --> 00:39:01,540
Kanta & Haru-chan's

440
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Let's do it!

441
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,540
What are you going to do from now on?

442
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,540
I'm going to do a shuffle rank.

443
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:22,540
I'm going to do it every time, but I'm going to do it again this time.

444
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:30,540
From this time on, I'm going to add one by one.

445
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,340
I will announce one by one.

446
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:42,140
For example, if you have a difference, you can make a difference while having sex.

447
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,340
What? Everyone?

448
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,140
Yes, everyone should cooperate.

449
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,940
I don't do that.

450
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,340
Everyone should cooperate.

451
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,040
Can't you make a difference?

452
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,540
What? Well...

453
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Well, that's right.

454
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Well, well, well.

455
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,540
Well, everyone, let's cooperate.

456
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,540
What we want to say is that

457
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,540
It's not just sex.

458
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Everyone is encouraging and cooperating.

459
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Let's make one art.

460
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,540
It's a warm welcome.

461
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
Is it okay, everyone?

462
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Is that okay?

463
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
I'm the worst.

464
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,540
I don't think you know the best.

465
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
I know.

466
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
Do you understand?

467
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
You're a veteran, right?

468
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
Yes!

469
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,540
Now, I'll announce the winner!

470
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
Come on!

471
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,540
Ma!

472
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,540
Ma!

473
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,540
Here you go!

474
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Come on, come on, come on!

475
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Are you ready?

476
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,540
Is it good around here?

477
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
I think it looks good.

478
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
It will start soon.

479
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,540
Do you like drawing?

480
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
Do you like it?

481
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,540
Are you ready?

482
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
Yes.

483
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
If you feel good, make more.

484
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
It's good.

485
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
You can do both.

486
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
It's like this.

487
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,540
Like this.

488
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
Like this.

489
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Like this.

490
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,540
It's good.

491
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
It's good.

492
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
You can't bend down here.

493
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
It's good.

494
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Up to here?

495
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,540
Like this.

496
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,540
It's good.

497
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
It's good.

498
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
It's dangerous.

499
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
It's different even if you feel it.

500
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
What?

501
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,540
What?

502
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
It's not the evil spirit.

503
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
It's around here.

504
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
Isn't it off?

505
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,540
It's around here.

506
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
It's off.

507
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,540
Isn't it off if I shoot it?

508
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,540
A little more.

509
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,540
A little more.

510
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,540
If the remaining glue comes out, what should I do?

511
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,540
Then I'll put this tape and the tape on my nails.

512
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
Let's do 20 cm.

513
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,540
I'll do it.

514
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
Come on.

515
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Come on.

516
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
OK.

517
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
I'm nervous.

518
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,540
20 cm.

519
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
20 cm.

520
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,540
1 cm.

521
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,540
Can I get in?

522
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Let's go inside.

523
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
Let's go inside.

524
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Let's go inside.

525
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Do you like it?

526
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I like it.

527
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
It's different.

528
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,540
This is everyone's picture.

529
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,540
It's different.

530
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,540
I have to eat it.

531
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
What is this?

532
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Oh, but it seems to be.

533
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
It's like this.

534
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
I'm so happy to see you.

535
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
You're so cute.

536
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,040
Let's go.

537
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,640
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?

538
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,840
You'll get used to it soon enough.

539
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,640
Mocha? Mocha?

540
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,040
What's going on, Mama?

541
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,240
It's hot!

542
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,640
It's hot!

543
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
I'm so excited.

544
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
It feels good.

545
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,640
I want you to give me your tongue.

546
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,640
I want you to give me your tongue.

547
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,640
I'm scared.

548
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
It moved.

549
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,640
It moved.

550
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
It moved.

551
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,640
That's it.

552
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
They are terrible.

553
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,640
I'm scared.

554
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
I'm scared.

555
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
I'm scared.

556
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,640
I'm scared.

557
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,640
I'm scared.

558
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,640
It seems that there are people who say that they saw it.

559
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,640
Let's do it.

560
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
1,2

561
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
Ma

562
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,640
I will read the next letter.

563
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,640
You're here, you're here.

564
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,640
You're here, so you're wrong.

565
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
I'll put on my glasses.

566
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
It's okay.

567
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
Are you okay?

568
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
Can I lick your ears?

569
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,640
What is that?

570
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Teacher?

571
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Teacher?

572
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,640
Teacher?

573
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,640
What is this?

574
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
It's not working.

575
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,640
It's working.

576
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,640
It's not working.

577
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,640
It's not working.

578
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,640
Please continue.

579
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,640
I want to go home.

580
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
I want to go home.

581
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,640
No, I can't.

582
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,640
You can do it.

583
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,640
I'm watching you.

584
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,640
Then lick the nipple.

585
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,640
No, no, no.

586
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,640
I'm watching you.

587
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,640
I'm watching you.

588
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,640
I'm going to put it in.

589
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Can I put it in?

590
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
It's hot.

591
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,640
It's hot.

592
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,640
Wait, no, no, no.

593
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,640
There, there, there.

594
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,640
No, it hurts.

595
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,640
It hurts.

596
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,640
Wait, no, no, no.

597
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,640
No.

598
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,640
It's not good.

599
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,640
Wait.

600
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,640
It's okay.

601
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
It's okay.

602
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,640
Calm down.

603
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,640
It's okay.

604
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,640
I'm sorry.

605
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Now, let's see the reaction.

606
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,640
40 people are crying.

607
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
40 people are crying.

608
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,640
Amazing.

609
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,640
3 people are crying at 10 o'clock in the front.

610
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,640
1, 2, 3.

611
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,640
I cried for 40 yen.

612
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
I cried.

613
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,640
The next word is...

614
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,640
The last word is...

615
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,640
I don't know where I am.

616
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,640
I don't know where I am.

617
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,640
I feel like I'm going to puke.

618
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,640
It feels so good.

619
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,640
If you do it like this, it will look like this.

620
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,640
It's in the middle.

621
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Look, Tamasaki-san is waiting for you.

622
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Tamasaki-san is waiting for you.

623
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,640
Tamasaki-san is waiting for you.

624
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,640
Look, he's sitting down.

625
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,640
Ah, that's what you mean?

626
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,640
Come here.

627
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,640
Where are you going? Are you going to make a hole?

628
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,640
There's only one hole in the hole.

629
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,640
Is that so?

630
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,640
Ah! Ah! Ah!

631
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,640
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

632
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,640
Can I get it?

633
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,640
Ah! It's so nice!

634
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Ah! Hamasaki-san, that's not it!

635
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,640
That's not it!

636
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,640
Ah!

637
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,640
You can do it, right?

638
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,640
You can do it, right?

639
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,640
You can do it, right?

640
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,640
Let's go!

641
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,640
One, two!

642
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,640
Go!

643
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Do whatever you want!

644
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,640
It's so small.

645
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,640
It's so small.

646
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,640
It's so small.

647
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,640
It's so small.

648
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,640
It's so small.

649
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,640
Put it in your mouth.

650
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,640
I'll drink it all.

651
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,640
Really?

652
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,640
Is it okay to go?

653
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
It's so small.

654
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,640
It's so big.

655
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,640
It's so small.

656
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,640
It's so small.

657
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,640
How many times did you do it today?

658
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,640
Three times.

659
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,640
Three times? You did it three times?

660
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Yes.

661
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Then...

662
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Wait, I can't concentrate. It feels good.

663
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,640
No, don't do that!

664
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Ah!

665
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,640
Ah!

666
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Ah!

667
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,640
Ah!

668
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,640
Ah!

669
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,640
Ah!

670
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,640
I'm so tired.

671
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,640
Hey, hey, everyone, look at me.

672
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,640
When will you feel good when you look at me?

673
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,640
I can't do that.

674
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,640
What are you doing?

675
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
It's warm.

676
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,640
Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass.

677
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,640
Pass.

678
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Pass.

679
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,640
Oh, no.

680
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Oh, no.

681
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,640
Oh, no.

682
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
Oh, no.

683
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Ouch!

684
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,640
Chinko is getting really stiff.

685
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,640
It's coming out.

686
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
It's coming out a lot.

687
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,640
The amount is getting smaller.

688
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,640
Will it come out?

689
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
It's coming out.

690
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,640
It's coming out.

691
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,640
It's delicious.

692
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:38,640
Do you want to drink it?

693
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,640
Is it good?

694
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,640
Is it good?

695
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,640
Did you go?

696
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,640
Did you go?

697
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,640
Really?

698
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,640
It's dangerous.

699
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,640
It hurts.

700
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Did you squeeze it?

701
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,640
Did you squeeze it?

702

I want to go to the bathroom.

719
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,640
What should I do?

720
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,640
Oh, my God.

01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,640
I'm not a professional.

778
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,640
Everyone, let's do it.

779
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,640
Good, good.

780

Are you there?

798
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,640
Let's jump!

799
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,640
I was surprised!

800
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,640
I was surprised!

801
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
Give me your tail!

Give me your tail!

803
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,640

Ah...

805
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,640
Is it okay if I put something in here?

806
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,640
Thank you!

807
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,640

You can lick it.

818
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,640
Lick it.

819
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,640
Is it good?

820
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,640
It's good, isn't it?

821
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,640
It's good.

822
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,640
It's good, isn't it?

823
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,640
Use your tongue more.

824
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,640
It's sweet.

825
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,640
It's sweet.

826
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,640
Chikkun, don't hit me.

827
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,640
No.

828
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,640

Oh, no.

834
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,640
You're so erotic.

835
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,640
You're so erotic.

836
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,640
What are you doing?

837
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,640
What are you doing?

838
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,640
Let's eat!

839
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,640
It's Seiza!

840
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,640
It's Seiza!

841
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,640
What are you going to do?

842

Here's the finished Doraemon!

843
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
Wait a minute!

844
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,640
It was good, wasn't it?

845
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,640
Seiza! Seiza!

846
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,640
Wait a minute.

847
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:56,640
What did you do?

848
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,640
It's Doraemon.

849
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,640
You can't do that.

850
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,640
Ah, yes, yes!

851
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,640
Bite me!

852
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,640

01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,640
Bite me!

856
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,640
Bite me!

857
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,640
No!

858
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Bite me.

859
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,640
Bite me.

01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,640
Ah, yes!

861
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,640
Ah, yes!

862
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,640
Hey, you three.

863
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Hey, don't start acting here!

864
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Yes, everyone, one by one!

865
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,640
Yes!

866
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,640
Then this person is the mecha.

867
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,640
Wait a minute.

868
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,640
Wait a minute.

869
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,640
What are you doing?

870
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,640
You are making me dizzy.

871
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,640
Are you serious?

872
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,640
What are you doing?

873
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,640
Look at this.

874
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,640
What is this?

875
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,640
Look at this properly.

876
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,640
You shouldn't do that.

877
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,640
You shouldn't do that.

878
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,640
Everyone, look at this.

879
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,640
Hey, hey, hey.

880
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,640
Hey, hey, hey.

881
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,640
You are making me dizzy.

882
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,640
This is crazy.

883
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,640
Don't look at it.

884
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,640
Look at it properly.

885
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,640
Wow, amazing.

886
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,640
If you say, don't look at it,

887
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,640
I'll put it in the sink.

888
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,640
I'm so happy.

889
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,640
Wait a minute.

890
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,640
Hey, what are you doing?

891
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,640
I'm so happy.

892
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,640
Look at it.

893
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,640
Look at it.

894
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,640
I'm so happy.

895
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,640
Look at it.

896
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,640
It turned into a mess!

897
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,640
Oh my god!

898
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,640
Everyone is sleeping in the same bed today.

899
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,640
Congratulations!

900
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,640
If you're not tied up, lick it properly.

901
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,640
I have to do it.

902
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Lick it.

903
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,640
I want to be sucked in.

904
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,640
You can do it.

905
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,640
You can't help it.

906
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,640
I'm so glad.

907
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,640
I'm so sorry.

908
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,640
It feels good.

909
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,640
Amazing.

910
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,640
Jin is getting stiff.

911
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,640
He's getting really stiff.

912
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,640
He's been repaid.

913
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,640
He's been repaid.

914
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,640
Please sit down.

915
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,640
Look at his tail.

916
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,640
Look at his tail.

917
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,640
He's getting wet.

918
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,640
I'll pet him.

919
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,640
He's getting wet.

920
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,640
He's getting tied up over there.

921
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,640
He's getting wet.

922
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,640
Wait a minute.

923
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,640
You're not even moving your body.

924
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,640
Let's tighten up your body.

925
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,640
Oh, it came off.

926
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,640
You can run away if you want.

927
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,640
Hey, hey, hey.

928
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

929
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,640
What's wrong?

930
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,640
You're being tightened up.

931
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,640
I'm fine if you're tightened up.

932
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,640
I'll help you.

933
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,640
I can't move my right hand.

934
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,640
I've been tightened up.

935
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,640
Here we go!

936
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,640
No?

937
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,640
It feels good when it's spilled.

938
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,640
OK!

939
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,640
Oh!

940
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,640
It was good!

941
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,640
It was good!

942
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,640
It was the opposite, wasn't it?

943
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,640
Nice, Senpai!

944
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,640
I put out a lot.

945
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,640
I put out a lot today.

946
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
It's amazing.

947
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,640
While being double-footed.

948
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:44,640
Why did you guys become a couple?

949
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,640
Wow, that's great.

950
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,640
That's great.

951
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,640
I'm getting stiff.

952
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,640
But I'm here.

953
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,640
Hey, you!

954
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:59,640
Hey, you! What are you doing there?

955
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,640
What are you doing?

956
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,640
What are you doing?

957
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,640
What are you doing?

958
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,640
If you don't do it, you can't do it until the red card comes out, right?

959
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,640
Do it!

960
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,640
Run faster!

961
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,640
Otama-san, please get on.

962
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,640
It's a dress.

963
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,640
Slow down!

964
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,640
Slow down!

965
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,980
Oh, no!

966
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,380
Wait, wait, wait!

967
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,380
I'm going home.

968
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,380
Oh, no!

969
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,380
Oh, no!

970
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,380
Oh, no!

971
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,380
Oh, no!

972
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,380
I'm scared!

973
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,380
Oh, no!

974
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,380
It's hard!

975
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,380
Oh, no!

976
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,380
Oh, no!

977
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:44,380
Let's have a good dream!

978
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,380
Aikaro! Aikaro!

979
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,380
Let's go! Let's go!

980
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,380
Bye bye!

981
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,380
Bye bye!

982
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,380
Bye bye!

983
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,940
What is this, Hata-chan?

984
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:12,940
Halem? The other way around, Halem?

985
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,940
Please enjoy with Hata-chan, everyone.

986
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,940
Hata-chan!

987
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,940
Anaru!

988
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,940
Bye bye!

989
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,940
Hey, Anaru!

990
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,940
I wonder if the boys are really sleeping now.

991
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:47,940
I want to go see how they are doing.

992
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,940
I wonder if they are sleeping.

993
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,940
Let's go.

994
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:17,940
Are you sleeping?

995
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,940
Wake up.

996
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,940
Can you hear anything in this room?

997
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,940
I don't know

998
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:27,940
I don't know

999
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:30,940
I can't hear

1000
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,940
Are you okay?

1001
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:33,940
I can't hear

1002
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,940
I can't hear

1003
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,940
I can't see

1004
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,940
I can't see

1005
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,940
I can't see

1006
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:44,940
I can't see

1007
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,940
I'm sorry

1008
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:49,940
When I look this way, only my face is bright

1009
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:50,940
I feel like I know who it is

1010
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,940
What should I do?

1011
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:56,940
Please tell everyone not to sleep

1012
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,940
Please come early tomorrow

1013
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,940
I can't sleep yet

1014
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,940
Let's sit next to each other.

1015
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:32,940
They are sleeping.

1016
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:41,940
They are sleeping.

1017
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,940
Baby is sleeping.

1018
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,940
He is sleeping.

1019
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,940
I'm sorry.

1020
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,940
What are you doing?

1021
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,940
Why are you awake?

1022
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,940
Why are you awake?

1023
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,940
I'm so sorry.

1024
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,940
Don't look at me.

1025
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,940
I'm sorry.

1026
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,940
Why are you awake?

1027
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,940
I'm sorry.

1028
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,940
I'm sorry.

1029
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,940
She woke me up.

1030
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,940
If you don't go to bed early, it will be morning tomorrow.

1031
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,940
It's not late tomorrow. It's early.

1032
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,940
I have to go to bed early.

1033
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,940
Can't you sleep excitedly?

1034
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,940
Is it not enough?

1035
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,940
I don't think so.

1036
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,940
Then you have to check it.

1037
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:41,940
I have to check it.

1038
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:42,940
Look, look.

1039
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,940
Are you still feeling better?

1040
01:27:58,940 --> 01:27:59,940
Show me.

1041
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,940
Ah, you're feeling better already.

1042
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,940
How many did you get today?

1043
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,940
I got three.

1044
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:10,940
You're still getting bigger even though you took off your pants?

1045
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:13,940
Were you sleeping?

1046
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,940
Are you having a good time?

1047
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:15,940
Really?

1048
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,940
Your cell phone is on.

1049
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,940
You're getting bigger.

1050
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,940
Stop it already.

1051
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,940
Look.

1052
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:30,940
You're so fat.

1053
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:32,940
I'm telling you, I'm the one with the long neck.

1054
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:35,940
You can't sleep at all with this.

1055
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,940
He's saying, it's me.

1056
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,940
It's not me, really.

1057
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,940
What do you want to do?

1058
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,940
What are you thinking about?

1059
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,940
Do you want to sleep?

1060
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:53,940
Do you want to sleep?

1061
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,940
It's nice, isn't it?

1062
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:57,940
It's nice, isn't it?

1063
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,940
What are you doing?

1064
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,940
Hey, did you really sleep?

1065
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:28,940
Really?

1066
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,940
You're kidding.

1067
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,940
Why are you so energetic?

1068
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:35,940
What's wrong?

1069
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,940
You're so energetic.

1070
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,940
It's so cute.

1071
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:51,940
It's so cute.

1072
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:53,940
It's so cute.

1073
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:55,940
What's wrong?

1074
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:58,940
Are you happy?

1075
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:00,940
It's coming again.

1076
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,940
It's not happy.

1077
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:05,940
It's happy.

1078
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,940
He's saying it feels good.

1079
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,940
I've done it twice today.

1080
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,940
I feel like I've done it again.

1081
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:27,940
I was surprised.

1082
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:29,940
I was so excited.

1083
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,940
What?

1084
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:35,940
You were so excited that you stood up again?

1085
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,940
You are such a good boy.

1086
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:38,940
I was so excited.

1087
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,940
You were excited?

1088
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,940
You wanted to be excited?

1089
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,940
Yes.

1090
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:43,940
I'm sorry.

1091
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,940
I wonder if you'll be able to sleep right away if you feel good again.

1092
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,940
You're so energetic.

1093
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:03,940
You're so energetic.

1094
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,940
Do you want to go home?

1095
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,940
It's not a dream.

1096
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,940
You woke up, didn't you?

1097
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:49,940
He said he went out twice today,

1098
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:52,940
so I'll let him go out more tomorrow.

1099
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:55,940
I'll pet him a lot.

1100
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,940
Is it delicious?

1101
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,940
Yes, it's delicious.

1102
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,940
He's getting bigger.

1103
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,940
He's energetic.

1104
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,940
Are you happy?

1105
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,940
Do you want to fight?

1106
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,940
What do you want to do?

1107
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,940
When I bite here, it becomes very sensitive.

1108
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,940
Look!

1109
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,940
You like it, don't you?

1110
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,940
You like it too?

1111
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,940
You like it too?

1112
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:39,940
You like it too?

1113
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,940
You want to be a bear?

1114
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,940
You're cute

1115
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,940
You're so soft

1116
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:23,940
Do you want to eat it?

1117
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,940
I'm hungry.

1118
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,940
I'm hungry too.

1119
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:32,940
Ah!

1120
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,940
Hmm...

1121
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:38,940
Ah...

1122
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,940
Pfft...

1123
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:43,940
Does it feel good?

1124
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:46,940
Hmm...

1125
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:48,940
Hmm...

1126
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:50,940
I'm so sleepy.

1127
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:52,940
Hmm?

1128
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,940
I'm so sleepy.

1129
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:57,940
Hmm...

1130
01:33:58,940 --> 01:33:59,940
Ah...

1131
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,940
I'm so tired.

1132
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,940
I'm so tired.

1133
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,940
I'm so tired.

1134
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,940
I'm so tired.

1135
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,940
I'm so tired.

1136
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:11,940
I'm so tired.

1137
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,940
I'm so sorry.

1138
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:15,940
Oh.

1139
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,940
Oh.

1140
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,940
Oh.

1141
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:21,940
Oh.

1142
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:23,940
Oh.

1143
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,940
Sorry.

1144
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,940
Don't cry.

1145
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:29,940
I don't want to cry.

1146
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:31,940
I've put a lot of stuff today.

1147
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,940
Sorry.

1148
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,940
How many times did you put it today?

1149
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,940
I put it four times today.

1150
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,940
Four times?

1151
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,940
I think I can still do it.

1152
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,940
You think you can still do it?

1153
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:45,940
You can still do it!

1154
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,940
You're so stubborn.

1155
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:58,940
Take your pants off and do this.

1156
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:05,940
You like him?

1157
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:18,940
Oh, I was long gone.

1158
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:26,940
I want to put it out tomorrow too, and I want to show it to you.

1159
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,940
Let's sleep tonight as it is tomorrow.

1160
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,940
Yes.

1161
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:34,940
I want to show it to you too.

1162
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,940
I'm going to sleep now.

1163
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,940
I'm going to sleep now.

1164
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,940
I'm going to sleep now.

1165
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:43,940
I want to show it to you tomorrow too.

1166
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:47,940
I want to show it to you tomorrow too.

1167
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,940
Let's sleep today.

1168
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,940
Let's sleep.

1169
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,940
How is it?

1170
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,940
How is it?

1171
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,940
Let's sleep.

1172
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:59,940
Let's sleep.

1173
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,940
Why can we sleep?

1174
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,940
Good night.

1175
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,940
Can't sleep?

1176
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,940
Can't sleep?

1177
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,940
Yes.

1178
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,940
Really?

1179
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,940
Are you embarrassed?

1180
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:22,940
But you felt good, didn't you?

1181
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:23,940
Yes.

1182
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,940
I love you.

1183
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,940
I'm so excited.

1184
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:35,940
I'll bring this to you tomorrow.

1185
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,940
Thank you.

1186
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,940
Good night.

1187
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,940
Good night.

1188
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:47,940
See you tomorrow.

1189
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,940
Good night.

1190
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,940
Good night.

1191
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,940
Good night.

1192
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,940
Thank you for your hard work.

1193
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:05,940
See you later.

1194
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,940
It's hard on your stomach.

1195
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,940
Good night.

1196
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,940
Bye-bye, Kotomi.

1197
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,940
See you tomorrow.

1198
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,940
See you tomorrow!

1199
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:29,940
But tomorrow's...

1200
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:32,940
Tomorrow's prey is going to be two people.

1201
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,940
See you tomorrow!

1202
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:38,940
See you tomorrow!

1203
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,940
See you tomorrow!

1204
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,940
Oh, really? Then I'll stay.

1205
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,940
Bye-bye!

1206
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,940
Let's close the door.

1207
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:49,940
Let's close the door.

1208
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,940
Then I'll stay.

1209
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,940
Bye-bye!

1210
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,940
Good night!

1211
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,940
Say bye-bye to everyone.

1212
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:58,940
Say bye-bye to everyone.

1213
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,940
That's it for today. We're going to sleep too.

1214
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:10,940
Good night.

1215
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,940
Good night.

1216
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:13,940
Oh, my god!

1217
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:19,940
Oh, my god! They are making me cry!

1218
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:26,940
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1219
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,940
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1220
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:36,940
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1221
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:38,940
I have to sleep!

1222
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:39,940
I'm sleepy.

1223
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:41,000
Wow!

1224
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,560
Nooo!

1225
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,400
Everybody, cheer up!

1226
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,400
Let's go!

1227
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,400
Let's go!

1228
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,400
OK!

1229
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,400
Let's go!

1230
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,400
Let's go!

1231
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,400
OK

1232
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,400
Let's go!

1233
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,400
OK

1234
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,400
Do your best!

1235
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,400
Let's go!

1236
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,400
Do your best!

1237
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,400
OK

1238
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,400
Let's go!

1239
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,400
Let's go!

1240
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,400
Let's go!

1241
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,400
Let's go for the first time.

1242
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,400
Let's go!

1243
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,400
Yes!

1244
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,400
Yes!

1245
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,400
Yes!

1246
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,400
Yes!

1247
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,400
Good!

1248
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,400
It's warm!

1249
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:33,400
Micro, micro.

1250
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,400
It looks heavy.

1251
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,400
It's heavy.

1252
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,400
Are you filming something?

1253
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,400
Of course.

1254
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,400
The sun is shining.

1255
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,400
It's bright.

1256
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,400
The sun is shining.

1257
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,400
The sun is shining.

1258
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,400
The sun is shining.

1259
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,400
The sun is shining.

1260
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,400
The sun is shining.

1261
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,400
The sun is shining.

1262
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,400
Great!

1263
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,400
Bye-bye!

1264
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,400
Okay!

1265
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,400
Let's go!

1266
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,400
Right arm, right arm, 3, 2, 1.

1267
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:30,400
Right arm, right arm, 3, 2, 1.

1268
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,400
Good.

1269
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,400
Good.

1270
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,400
Right arm, right arm, 3, 2, 1.

1271
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,400
Good.

1272
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,400
Ichi, your hips are a little too high.

1273
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,400
Can you show us your hips while moving?

1274
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,400
Let's go!

1275
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,400
Let's try it.

1276
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,400
Go ahead.

1277
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,400
Right arm, right arm, 3, 2, 1.

1278
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,400
OK, 1, 2, 3.

1279
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,400
Great.

1280
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,400
Are you ready?

1281
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,400
OK, 1, 2, 3.

1282
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,400
OK, 1, 2, 3.

1283
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,400
Ready?

1284
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,400
OK, 1, 2, 3.

1285
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,400
I'm holding a swimsuit.

1286
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,400
Are you holding a swimsuit?

1287
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:55,400
It's important to feel like you're sticking out a little bit.

1288
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Thank you.

1289
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,400
Me too.

1290
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,400
Thank you.

1291
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,400
Ready, set, go!

1292
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,400
Noogie's Fan Festival!

1293
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,400
Bako Bako Bus Tour 2014!

1294
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,400
Let's go, everyone!

1295
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,400
OK!

1296
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:49,400
The first game is to find the ultimate couple.

1297
01:44:52,400 --> 01:45:00,400
First of all, we will choose a couple with only the correctness of each other in the Manjin feeling of Bakobasu.

1298
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:15,400
Next, let's see if you can make a couple in both the inside and the outside.

1299
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:22,400
Let's start with the munching feeling.

1300
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:29,400
Please line up in a row.

1301
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,400
I can see your feet.

1302
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,400
Are you OK?

1303
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,400
I'm tired.

1304
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,400
Please crouch down.

1305
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,400
Crouch down.

1306
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,400
Are you OK?

1307
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,400
You can move.

1308
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,400
I'll get off the curtain at the same time as I open the door.

1309
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,400
OK?

1310
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,400
OK.

1311
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,400
Open!

1312
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,400
This is so funny!

1313
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,400
This is so funny!

1314
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,400
He's laughing! He's laughing!

1315
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,400
Everyone, please be quiet!

1316
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,400
He's laughing!

1317
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,400
This is so funny!

1318
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,400
Can I touch it?

1319
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,400
Yes, you can!

1320
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,400
He's scared!

1321
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:26,400
I think there are different shapes and different types of people you like.

1322
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,400
I'd like you to think about that while you're at it.

1323
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,400
Everyone, there are different types of people you like.

1324
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,400
You don't want to do it, do you?

1325
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,400
I don't know.

1326
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,400
You should be energetic.

1327
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,400
I don't know if I'm energetic or not.

1328
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,400
That's right.

1329
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,400
Be energetic.

1330
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,400
You should be energetic.

1331
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,400
Be energetic.

1332
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,400
If we say, be energetic, she will be energetic.

1333
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,400
Be a honest girl.

1334
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,400
I'm lost.

1335
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:06,400
Ah!

1336
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,400
My back is shaking.

1337
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,400
Wow!

1338
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,400
It's really shaking.

1339
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,400
Rin-Pin!

1340
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,400
Yes.

1341
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Wait!

1342
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,400
I'm lost.

1343
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:19,400
It's really strange.

1344
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:20,400
I'm lost.

1345
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:21,400
Number 2.

1346
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,400
I'm lost.

1347
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,400
I'm lost.

1348
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,400
My back is shaking.

1349
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,400
Why is it so big?

1350
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,400
This is fun!

1351
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,400
Wow!

1352
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,400
Wow!

1353
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,400
It's a little wet.

1354
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,400
Are you ready?

1355
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:48,400
If you're a little worried, come over here.

1356
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,400
We have a teacher here.

1357
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,400
Please write down your name and number.

1358
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,400
I think it's better to have a healthy morning, isn't it?

1359
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,400
I wonder what it is.

1360
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,400
It's almost time to finish.

1361
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,400
What should I do?

1362
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,400
What should I do?

1363
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,400
I think the most useful thing in a manco is...

1364
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,400
the most useful thing in a chinko.

1365
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,400
I'm done.

1366
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,400
Please give it to me.

1367
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,400
Please give it to me.

1368
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,400
Please give it to me.

1369
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,400
It's difficult.

1370
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,400
It's difficult.

1371
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,400
Is it that difficult?

1372
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,400
But everyone has the same number.

1373
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,400
It's okay.

1374
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,400
Yes.

1375
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,400
Yes.

1376
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,400
Yes.

1377
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,400
I see.

1378
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,400
I see.

1379
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,400
Is it okay?

1380
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,400
This is a collection.

1381
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,400
This is a collection.

1382
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,600
I'm a middle school student.

1383
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,900
Okay, now we're going to change the course.

1384
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,400
Please turn around.

1385
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:14,100
Okay.

1386
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:15,200
Please turn around.

1387
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,000
We're going to do the reverse version.

1388
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,700
Okay, everyone, please stand by.

1389
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:20,200
Chome-chome, open!

1390
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:22,900
Oh!

1391
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,400
Great!

1392
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,000
Okay.

1393
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,800
Okay, the camera is filming now.

1394
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,900
I'm sure everyone is enjoying this, right?

1395
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,600
Yeah.

1396
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,600
It's going to take a while, isn't it?

1397
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,600
Wow.

1398
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,600
How is it, everyone? Take a look.

1399
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,600
How is it?

1400
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,600
Is it different?

1401
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,600
It's different.

1402
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,600
It's serious.

1403
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,600
I'm sorry.

1404
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,600
I'm sorry.

1405
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,600
It's hard to see a bank that's easy to see.

1406
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,600
It's a bit stuck.

1407
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,600
It's stuck.

1408
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,600
How is it?

1409
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,600
Everyone, come closer.

1410
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,600
Are you tired?

1411
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:27,600
Can I take a look?

1412
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,600
Not yet?

1413
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,600
Not yet, not yet.

1414
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,600
Oh.

1415
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,600
Yes.

1416
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,600
Please search for the one you like.

1417
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,600
This is Don't Touch Me.

1418
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,600
Is that okay?

1419
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,600
It means you won't touch it if you break it.

1420
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:56,600
Please tell me your favorite number.

1421
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,600
I'll close up.

1422
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,600
Number 3?

1423
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,600
Which number do you want?

1424
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:03,600
Number 3.

1425
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,600
What? Number 3?

1426
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,600
Number 3.

1427
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Number 3?

1428
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,600
I see. Who is number 3?

1429
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,600
Who is number 3?

1430
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,600
I see.

1431
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,600
Who is number 3?

1432
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:22,600
I said I was happy.

1433
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:30,600
Even if you say you like it, I'm sure you have a lot of feelings.

1434
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:39,600
I'm a little worried about this.

1435
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,600
Number 12.

1436
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,600
Number 12?

1437
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,600
I'm number 12 too.

1438
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,600
Why?

1439
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,600
What's the reason?

1440
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,600
I feel like it's coming out like this.

1441
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,600
It's coming out like this.

1442
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,600
Is it easy to put in?

1443
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,600
It's easy to put in.

1444
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,600
You don't want to do half of it, do you?

1445
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:01,600
There's a will to never show it.

1446
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,600
It's coming out of the hole.

1447
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,600
You don't want to show it, do you?

1448
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:11,600
There was a lot of consciousness that it wasn't in the middle.

1449
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:15,240
After that, try to get wet a little.

1450
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:16,720
Are you all right?

1451
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,400
Isn't it better not to get a cold?

1452
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,600
Yes, please hold the staff.

1453
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,440
What?

1454
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,720
Isn't it a little wet in the middle?

1455
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:30,080
Hey, it's fluffy.

1456
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:32,640
I don't know if it's because the weather is bad.

1457
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,640
I'm going to blow it a little.

1458
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,640
It's fun if you blow it.

1459
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:46,640
It's stupid.

1460
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,640
Is there anything you're interested in?

1461
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,640
You did it on number 14.

1462
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:58,640
Hold on.

1463
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,640
Even number 14 has a round butt.

1464
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,640
You're good.

1465
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,640
I'm not.

1466
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,640
You're a girl.

1467
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,640
It's time to enter.

1468
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:14,640
Number 14, you've done a great job.

1469
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,640
Which number do you want?

1470
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,640
Say it.

1471
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:20,640
Which number do you want?

1472
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:24,640
Number 12.

1473
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,640
Number 12.

1474
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:59,640
Now, what's next?

1475
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:06,640
This time, there are no stiff people.

1476
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,640
Yes.

1477
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,640
I see.

1478
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,640
Like this.

1479
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:14,640
Like this, like this, like this, like this.

1480
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:17,640
Ah, this time it's different.

1481
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,640
This is the same ball.

1482
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,640
If you multiply it, it's the same.

1483
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:23,640
It's the same.

1484
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:25,640
No. 9 has entered.

1485
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,640
Oh, I see.

1486
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,640
Well then, the results will be announced later.

1487
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:36,640
Goodbye. Thank you very much.

1488
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:41,640
I will announce the results later.

1489
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:45,640
Well then, everyone, the location has changed.

1490
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,640
From now on, free time.

1491
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,640
Let's start the talk time.

1492
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:58,640
Start!

1493
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:00,640
Please.

1494
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:02,640
Don't stop.

1495
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,640
Don't stop.

1496
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:06,640
There is no camera like this.

1497
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,640
Thank you.

1498
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,640
Shoshin-Gumi?

1499
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,640
Shoshin-Gumi.

1500
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:36,640
I'm sure you'll be the monster of this time.

1501
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,640
Thank you.

1502
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,640
I got this set.

1503
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,640
Thank you very much.

1504
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,640
I'm sorry.

1505
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,640
I'm sorry.

1506
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,640
I'm sorry.

1507
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:49,640
I'm sorry.

1508
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,640
I'm sorry.

1509
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,640
I'm sorry.

1510
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,640
I'm sorry.

1511
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:57,640
I'm sorry.

1512
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:59,640
I'm sorry.

1513
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,640
I'm sorry.

1514
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,640
I'm sorry.

1515
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:08,640
I'm Midori.

1516
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,640
I saw a black one.

1517
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:13,640
This is different.

1518
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:15,640
I'm sorry.

1519
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:16,640
I'm sorry.

1520
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:18,640
I'm sorry.

1521
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:20,640
And it's the opposite.

1522
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,640
And it's the opposite.

1523
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,640
I'm sorry.

1524
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,640
I'm sorry.

1525
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,640
I'm sorry.

1526
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,640
I'm sorry.

1527
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,640
I see.

1528
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,640
Oh, I see.

1529
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,640
I like this feeling.

1530
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,640
I knew it.

1531
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,640
I knew it.

1532
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,640
I knew it.

1533
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:47,640
I knew it.

1534
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,640
I want to sleep again.

1535
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:49,640
You're right.

1536
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,640
It's not clean.

1537
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:53,640
It's not clean.

1538
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,640
I knew it.

1539
01:57:55,640 --> 01:58:00,640
Hi, I'm Yasuyosu, a girl.

1540
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:03,640
I'm in charge of distribution.

1541
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:09,640
I think it's better to do it when you're in trouble.

1542
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:11,640
I often do it in the video.

1543
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,640
Really?

1544
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:17,640
I'm really surprised.

1545
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,640
I've done it once.

1546
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:21,640
This is the fifth time, so it's good.

1547
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:23,640
That's right.

1548
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:25,640
You've been here since you were little, haven't you?

1549
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,640
Yeah, I've been here since I was little.

1550
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,640
Nice to meet you.

1551
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,640
This is for girls.

1552
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,640
This is for boys.

1553
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:48,640
It's time to confess!

1554
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,640
It's really exciting.

1555
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,640
Are you excited?

1556
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,640
Yes, I'm excited.

1557
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,640
Ladies and gentlemen, from now on,

1558
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:05,640
please take the man you want to confess to on the slider and confess.

1559
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,640
If the man is okay,

1560
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:11,640
please come down the stairs together.

1561
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:14,640
If you can't, please slide the slider.

1562
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,640
Are you ready?

1563
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,640
Yes.

1564
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:18,640
Please wait a moment.

1565
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:19,640
Yes.

1566
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:20,640
Let's go.

1567
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:21,640
Are you ready?

1568
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:22,640
Yes.

1569
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:23,640
Are you ready?

1570
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,640
Yes.

1571
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:25,640
Where are you going?

1572
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,640
Let's go.

1573
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:27,640
Yes.

1574
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:28,640
Are you serious?

1575
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,640
Yes.

1576
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,640
Let's go.

1577
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,640
Go for it.

1578
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:32,640
Go for it.

1579
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:33,640
Go for it.

1580
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,640
Go for it.

1581
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:35,640
Everyone is watching.

1582
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,640
Please wait a moment.

1583
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:37,640
Great.

1584
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:40,640
Everyone is looking forward to it.

1585
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:42,640
They think it's me.

1586
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:44,940
I feel like I'm going to cry.

1587
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,340
Don't worry.

1588
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:50,440
Give it your best shot.

1589
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:52,740
Do you know your name?

1590
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,640
Say it out loud.

1591
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,140
Can I bring her?

1592
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,440
Of course.

1593
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:59,440
Let's do it.

1594
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,440
Do your best!

1595
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:25,440
Everyone's nervous!

1596
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,440
I don't want to slide!

1597
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,440
I'm going to do the shooting!

1598
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:30,440
I don't want to!

1599
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:32,440
Raise your voice and show us your national flag!

1600
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:33,440
Go!

1601
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,440
Can you step back a little?

1602
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,440
Yes.

1603
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,440
Raise your voice.

1604
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:44,440
Well...

1605
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:46,440
This is bad!

1606
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:47,440
This is bad!

1607
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,440
Do your best.

1608
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,440
Well...

1609
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:54,440
I've heard a lot of things about you.

1610
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,440
They talked about a lot of things and made me feel excited.

1611
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:13,440
When we were eating, they noticed how nervous I was.

1612
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:20,440
I had a great time.

1613
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:24,440
If you don't mind, please come down the stairs with me.

1614
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,440
How is it?

1615
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:27,440
Please.

1616
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,440
Yaaay!

1617
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:31,440
Yaaay!

1618
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,440
Ok, please stand up.

1619
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,440
No, I can't.

1620
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,440
Yaaay!

1621
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,440
Ok, let's go with the two of you.

1622
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,440
Wow!

1623
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,440
Ok.

1624
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,440
You can call her by her name or call her by her name.

1625
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,440
Go ahead.

1626
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,440
Are you embarrassed?

1627
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,440
Yes, I am.

1628
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:07,440
What if she rejects you?

1629
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:10,440
Yuki, please hold her hand.

1630
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,440
Yes.

1631
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,440
You don't have to turn around.

1632
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,440
You don't have to turn around.

1633
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:20,440
Go ahead.

1634
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,440
Here?

1635
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:24,440
Over there.

1636
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,440
Thank you very much.

1637
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,440
Please say something.

1638
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:43,440
Thank you for talking to me.

1639
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,440
Thank you very much.

1640
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:48,440
How was it?

1641
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:51,140
Thank you so much.

1642
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:54,140
Let's sing together.

1643
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:57,140
I'm so excited.

1644
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:04,040
Natsume, please sing.

1645
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:05,240
Really?

1646
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,440
Do you know her name?

1647
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,840
Really?

1648
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,940
You can call her by her name or bring her here.

1649
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:12,940
Then I'll bring her here.

1650
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:14,440
Go ahead.

1651
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:16,440
Who is it?

1652
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:20,440
Wait a minute.

1653
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,440
Wait a minute. Who is it?

1654
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:23,440
Wait a minute.

1655
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:24,440
Wait a minute.

1656
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,440
You two.

1657
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,440
You two.

1658
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:33,440
You two.

1659
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,440
Please confess.

1660
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:38,440
Wait a minute.

1661
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,440
Who is it with you?

1662
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,440
What's going to happen?

1663
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:47,440
Really? I'm a little nervous.

1664
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,440
Are you nervous?

1665
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,440
Yes, I am.

1666
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:57,440
I like your face.

1667
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:00,440
Thank you.

1668
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:09,440
I said I was M at first.

1669
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:15,440
I'm S, so I chose it because I like people who can tease me.

1670
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,440
Thank you very much.

1671
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,440
I'm going. Where is the sleeper?

1672
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,440
Let's go!

1673
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,440
Oh no! It's cold!

1674
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:16,440
I'm glad you're good at it.

1675
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:25,440
You know the name and the face, right?

1676
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,440
Yes, I do.

1677
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:30,440
You can drink it or put it on your head.

1678
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:34,440
I've taken care of this.

1679
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:40,440
Whose turn is it?

1680
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:42,440
Yes, I'll do it.

1681
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,440
Are you ready?

1682
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,440
Applause!

1683
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,440
Wait a minute.

1684
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,440
You can do it here.

1685
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:59,440
Go ahead.

1686
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,440
My back hurts.

1687
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:08,440
What should I do?

1688
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:11,440
Okay, please show us your reaction.

1689
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:16,440
She was very kind and talkative.

1690
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:22,440
I like her appearance.

1691
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:34,440
I thought she would be a good match for me.

1692
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:39,440
Please come down the stairs with me.

1693
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,440
Please.

1694
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:43,440
Thank you.

1695
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:54,440
Thank you so much.

1696
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:56,440
Thank you so much.

1697
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:58,440
Thank you so much.

1698
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,440
You can call me by my name.

1699
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,440
Please.

1700
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:04,440
I'll call your name.

1701
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,440
Ichi-san, right?

1702
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:07,440
Yes.

1703
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:08,440
That's good.

1704
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:10,440
Wait a minute.

1705
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,440
You two, please.

1706
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,440
I'm so happy.

1707
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,440
I'm so happy.

1708
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:21,440
Okay.

1709
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,440
Let's start.

1710
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,440
I'll start.

1711
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:33,440
Well, I talked to him with courage, and he said yes!

1712
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:38,440
Let's do it together!

1713
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:40,440
Yes, please!

1714
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:48,440
Thank you!

1715
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:50,440
Are you ready?

1716
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:51,440
Is it good?

1717
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:52,440
Yeah.

1718
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:53,440
Is it good?

1719
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:54,440
Yeah.

1720
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:55,440
Here you go.

1721
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:58,440
You can drink it.

1722
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,440
You can eat it.

1723
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:01,440
Here you go.

1724
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,440
Ryu!

1725
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:07,440
Wait a minute.

1726
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,440
Here you go.

1727
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:10,440
Here you go.

1728
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:13,440
Wow.

1729
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:14,440
You can put it on.

1730
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,440
Here you go.

1731
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,440
Here you go.

1732
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:18,440
Here you go.

1733
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,440
Here you go.

1734
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:39,440
Well, yesterday, Yu told me that he wanted to be developed by Sakurai-san, so I wanted to develop it.

1735
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:44,440
Please give me Shiofuki and Anaru.

1736
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,440
Please.

1737
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,440
I did it!

1738
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,440
Have you decided?

1739
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,440
You can call me by my name.

1740
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:03,440
You can call me by my name.

1741
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,440
I'm going.

1742
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,440
Please.

1743
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:07,440
I'm going.

1744
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:41,440
I thought it would be nice to have a gentle face.

1745
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,440
Let's do it together.

1746
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:44,440
Please.

1747
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:46,440
Please.

1748
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:48,440
Thank you.

1749
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,440
What are you going to do?

1750
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:57,440
Yes.

1751
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,440
Are you going?

1752
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,440
Yes.

1753
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:00,440
Let's go.

1754
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,440
Please.

1755
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:02,440
What's wrong?

1756
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:03,440
I'm going.

1757
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,440
Are you going?

1758
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,440
Let's go.

1759
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,440
It's too dramatic.

1760
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,440
Hama-san, do you want to read it?

1761
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,440
Do you want to read it?

1762
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:13,440
Please come out with the person you think you are.

1763
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,440
Oh, it's a new pattern.

1764
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,440
Oh, my God.

1765
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:19,440
Please do it again.

1766
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:23,440
Please come out with the person you think you are.

1767
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:25,440
I'm sorry, I'm a husky.

1768
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:31,440
Why did you come this way?

1769
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:34,440
It's pretty late.

1770
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:37,440
Let's do it one more time with text 3.

1771
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:38,440
Okay.

1772
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:40,440
Okay, for now...

1773
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,440
For now, please go up.

1774
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:44,440
Please stand up.

1775
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:48,440
It was a new pattern.

1776
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:51,440
Well, it's kind of a dirty pattern, isn't it?

1777
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,440
Go up, go up.

1778
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:55,440
Wait a minute, isn't there anyone who can do that?

1779
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:56,440
Hey.

1780
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:57,440
Okay.

1781
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,440
I can't do it.

1782
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:06,440
What do you want to say to your fans?

1783
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:10,440
It's a serious story.

1784
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:15,440
I've never confessed my feelings in my life.

1785
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:19,440
I don't know how to confess my feelings.

1786
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:35,440
I want to talk to you today and have sex with you.

1787
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:38,440
Nice to meet you.

1788
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:40,440
Thank you!

1789
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,440
Thank you.

1790
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:51,440
Are you ready?

1791
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:53,440
Is there any left?

1792
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:54,440
Yes, there is.

1793
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:55,440
It's perfect.

1794
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,440
It's perfect.

1795
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:58,440
You can call her by her name.

1796
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:00,440
Okay.

1797
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:01,440
Here you go.

1798
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:02,440
Okay.

1799
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:06,440
A little more.

1800
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:37,440
Thank you.

1801
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:40,440
Shall we start?

1802
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,440
Well then.

1803
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:48,440
Yes.

1804
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,440
I've decided from the first impression.

1805
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:52,440
Thank you.

1806
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:53,440
Yes.

1807
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:58,440
Please.

1808
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,440
Do it for me.

1809
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:00,440
Wow, cheating.

1810
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:01,440
Yes.

1811
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:05,440
I want to talk more and do more erotic things.

1812
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,440
Let's do it.

1813
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:09,440
Who's going to do it?

1814
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:11,440
Who's going to do it?

1815
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:14,440
Who's going to do it?

1816
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:17,440
Who's going to do it?

1817
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:19,440
Yay!

1818
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:30,440
Fall!

1819
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:32,440
It's cold!

1820
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:34,440
Get off the boat!

1821
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:36,440
Let's go together.

1822
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:38,440
Together?

1823
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:40,440
I want to go too.

1824
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,440
It's so cold!

1825
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,440
It's amazing!

1826
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:52,440
Here we go!

1827
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,440
Are you ready?

1828
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:11,440
Are there any left?

1829
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,440
Of course!

1830
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,440
Let's go!

1831
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,440
You can pull it in or pull it out.

1832
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:21,440
I can't remember the name.

1833
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,440
I just made up my mind.

1834
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:24,440
I see.

1835
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:25,440
I'll show you.

1836
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,440
Go ahead.

1837
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:30,440
You did it.

1838
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:32,440
It's a great choice.

1839
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:35,440
Wait a minute.

1840
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,440
Please put it on top.

1841
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:39,440
It's a great choice.

1842
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:41,440
I'm so nervous.

1843
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,440
Really?

1844
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,440
I'm so nervous.

1845
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,440
What should I do?

1846
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:49,440
Let's go back to the starting line.

1847
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,440
Yes.

1848
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:53,440
Just now,

1849
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:55,440
I was late.

1850
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,440
I was saying yes, but I was late.

1851
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,440
I was told no.

1852
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:01,440
I was going back.

1853
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,440
I thought it was cute.

1854
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:05,440
Please edit it.

1855
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,440
Thank you very much.

1856
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,440
Congratulations.

1857
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:16,440
I did it.

1858
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:21,440
There are three people left.

1859
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,440
There are three people left, right?

1860
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,440
Yes.

1861
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:26,440
Let's go.

1862
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,440
I'm shaking.

1863
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:29,440
I'm shaking.

1864
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:32,440
You know that there is no pattern of one person, right?

1865
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:34,440
I don't know.

1866
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:37,440
Wait a minute, if you make a sound, which one will be dropped?

1867
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:40,440
Please call your name and pull it.

1868
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:42,440
Here you go!

1869
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:47,440
Who do you think it is?

1870
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:49,440
Oh!

1871
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:51,440
Wait a minute!

1872
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:54,440
Wait a minute!

1873
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:57,440
It's the two of you!

1874
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:00,440
You made a good voice.

1875
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:03,440
It was an unexpected development.

1876
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:06,440
Which one will win?

1877
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:10,440
I'm getting nervous.

1878
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:12,440
My heart is beating so fast.

1879
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:24,440
My voice is shaking.

1880
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:30,440
Well, the bus was next to me.

1881
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:37,440
I was happy that you talked to me.

1882
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:44,440
Well, what should I do?

1883
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:50,440
Yesterday's EDGE was great.

1884
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:53,440
I want to do it again.

1885
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:56,440
I want to do it again!

1886
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:00,440
Thank you very much.

1887
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,440
I'm so nervous.

1888
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:06,440
When I did the warm-up yesterday,

1889
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:11,440
I felt really good.

1890
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:17,440
I know I can't beat Hikaru-chan.

1891
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:22,440
I want to have sex with Abeno again.

1892
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,440
Please.

1893
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:43,440
I was rejected for the first time in two years.

1894
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:47,440
Are you going to wear this?

1895
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:49,440
Yes

1896
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:52,440
Thank you everyone

1897
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:54,440
See you later

1898
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:57,440
Bye bye

1899
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:09,440
I'm scared

1900
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:12,440
My nose hurts

1901
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:14,440
I was hit by a car.

1902
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:23,440
You are the last one.

1903
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:25,440
Are you ready?

1904
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,440
Yes.

1905
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:27,440
Please.

1906
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:30,440
You can call my name.

1907
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:32,440
You can pull me.

1908
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:33,440
Go ahead.

1909
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:06,440
I want to know more about Mana.

1910
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:09,440
I'm always looking at her.

1911
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:12,440
I'm so excited.

1912
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,440
I can't stand it anymore.

1913
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:18,440
I want to be with her.

1914
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:21,440
What do you think?

1915
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,440
Please.

1916
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:25,440
I did it!

1917
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:27,440
I did it!

1918
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:29,440
I did it!

1919
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:31,440
I did it!

1920
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,440
Let's do it!

1921
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:34,440
We did it!

1922
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:42,440
What's going on?

1923
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:45,440
I'm so happy!

1924
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,440
Congratulations!

1925
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:51,440
The two couples have succeeded in their marriage.

1926
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:53,440
Congratulations!

1927
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:55,440
Thank you very much.

1928
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:59,440
We will announce the final result of the final round.

1929
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:03,440
The result will be announced shortly.

1930
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:05,440
Congratulations!

1931
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:07,440
Congratulations!

1932
02:21:07,440 --> 02:21:09,440
Congratulations!

1933
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:11,440
Congratulations!

1934
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:13,440
Congratulations!

1935
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:15,440
Thank you very much.

1936
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:19,440
So everyone, Manchin Couple's ultimate couple has been born!

1937
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:26,440
This time, we're going to announce the winner!

1938
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,440
We're going to announce it now!

1939
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:31,440
Ta-da!

1940
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:39,440
First, we're going to announce the boy!

1941
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:41,440
Zuka.

1942
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:49,440
Please come to the center.

1943
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:55,440
There are some people who think it's good to see his penis.

1944
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:58,440
Please take a look at it later.

1945
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:00,440
You can see it later.

1946
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:02,440
But...

1947
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:05,440
Miss Makenara!

1948
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:12,440
This is the final song!

1949
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:14,440
Both of you!

1950
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:17,440
Look at this face!

1951
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:18,440
How is it?

1952
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,440
I'm happy. It's the best!

1953
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:20,440
It was good, wasn't it?

1954
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:21,440
Thank you.

1955
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:25,440
This is the best costume ever.

1956
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:37,440
For the two of you, please look behind you.

1957
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:43,440
We have prepared a special gold bed for you.

1958
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:51,440
If you say, which one is it, and if you say, which one is it, it's because you're the ultimate couple.

1959
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:53,440
Wow, that's amazing.

1960
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:54,440
Then the two of you, please.

1961
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:55,440
Is it unfair?

1962
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:57,440
It's unfair.

1963
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:59,440
Well, it can't be helped, it can't be helped.

1964
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:08,440
Please go up.

1965
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:10,440
Put your hands together like this.

1966
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:17,440
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

1967
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:19,440
That's right, that's right.

1968
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,440
Put your hands together like this.

1969
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:32,440
Okay, from the end,

1970
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:36,440
shall we go to the usual Daeranko?

1971
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,440
Let's go to the restaurant!

1972
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:39,440
Hey!

1973
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:40,440
Hey!

1974
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:43,440
I'm going to eat a spiny lobster!

1975
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:48,440
This is a small restaurant!

1976
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:50,440
This is our food!

1977
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:52,440
Hey!

1978
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,440
Hey, stop it!

1979
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,440
Stop it!

1980
02:25:57,440 --> 02:25:59,440
What's the most difficult one?

1981
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:01,440
Excuse me.

1982
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:08,440
I have made the name of my wife, Hamehameha, come to life!

1983
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:10,440
Thank you!

1984
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:23,440
Oh my god!

1985
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,440
It's so bad!

1986
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:27,440
It's so bad.

1987
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:37,440
It's so bad.

1988
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,440
We're done.

1989
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,440
It's really done.

1990
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,440
It's over.

1991
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,440
What are we going to do?

1992
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,440
What are we going to do?

1993
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:54,440
Let's get out of here.

1994
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:56,440
Shut up!

1995
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:58,440
I want to say something!

1996
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:01,440
Listen!

1997
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,440
What is it?

1998
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:07,440
My grandma told me that

1999
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:13,440
if you put a lot of players in this deck,

2000
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:16,440
you can beat the king of Hamehameha.

2001
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:17,440
What is it?

2002
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:19,440
Is it true?

2003
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:30,440
What is it?

2004
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:34,440
What is it?

2005
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:36,440
What is it?

2006
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:38,440
Yes!

2007
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:40,440
Yes!

2008
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:42,440
Good! Good!

2009
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:44,440
To save the world,

2010
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,440
let's eat a lot of food

2011
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,440
and defeat him!

2012
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:50,440
Yes!

2013
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:54,440
Who is he?

2014
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:56,440
Let's all do

2015
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:58,440
a big round to save the world!

2016
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,440
Let's do a big round!

2017
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,440
Yes!

2018
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:04,440
Start!

2019
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:06,440
Start!

2020
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:08,440
Start!

2021
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,440
I'm tired.

2022
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:12,440
I'm tired of this play.

2023
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:14,440
I'm tired.

2024
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:16,440
It's very dangerous.

2025
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:48,440
The baby is trying to get out of the way.

2026
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:58,440
The baby is trying to get out of the way.

2027
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:30,440
Do you feel better?

2028
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:32,440
It tickles.

2029
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:02,440
Oh, it hurts!

2030
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:14,440
Oh, it feels good.

2031
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,440
It hurts.

2032
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,440
It's hot.

2033
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,440
It's hot.

2034
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:03,440
You're so cute.

2035
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:09,440
Can you see?

2036
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:14,440
How many times have I kissed you?

2037
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:17,440
You can't do that.

2038
02:32:17,440 --> 02:32:19,440
How many times have I kissed you?

2039
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:21,440
I'm not kidding.

2040
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:23,440
You don't have to do that.

2041
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:33,440
You're kissing your wife.

2042
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:40,440
It went in.

2043
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:42,440
It went in.

2044
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:46,440
It feels good.

2045
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:49,440
Oh, it's in.

2046
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:52,440
Oh, wow.

2047
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:56,440
Oh, it feels good.

2048
02:32:56,440 --> 02:33:03,440
Oh, I'm crying.

2049
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:09,440
Oh, it feels good.

2050
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:12,440
I'm so happy.

2051
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:15,440
I'm so happy.

2052
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:23,440
I'm so happy.

2053
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:26,440
I'm so happy, too.

2054
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,000
It's tight.

2055
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,200
Ah!

2056
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:41,500
Aw, it feels good!

2057
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:48,840
Good girl, tender boy.

2058
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:19,840
I'm okay.

2059
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:32,840
I'm okay.

2060
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:35,840
Oh, sorry. Look at me.

2061
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:37,840
Stop it.

2062
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:40,840
Stop it.

2063
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:42,840
Hey, hey.

2064
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,840
Hey, hey.

2065
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:46,840
Hey, hey, hey.

2066
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:48,840
Stop it.

2067
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:50,840
Stop it.

2068
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:52,840
Stop it.

2069
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:54,840
Hey, hey.

2070
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:56,840
Hey, hey.

2071
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:57,840
Stop it.

2072
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:00,840
Hey, hey.

2073
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:02,840
It hurts.

2074
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:10,840
It feels good.

2075
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:12,840
Did you sleep?

2076
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:14,840
It hurts.

2077
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:16,840
It's been a while.

2078
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:18,840
It hurts.

2079
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:21,840
Stop! Stop it!

2080
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:24,840
Stop it! Stop it!

2081
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:27,840
Stop it! Stop it!

2082
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,840
Are you okay?

2083
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:48,840
I want to go home.

2084
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:50,840
What are you doing?

2085
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:52,840
What are you doing?

2086
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:54,840
What are you doing?

2087
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:56,840
I want to play with you.

2088
02:35:56,840 --> 02:35:58,840
What do you want to do?

2089
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:00,840
What's wrong?

2090
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:02,840
What's wrong?

2091
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:04,840
I have to eat a little bit.

2092
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:28,840
I have to eat a little bit.

2093
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,840
I have to eat something.

2094
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:00,840
What do you want to do?

2095
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:08,840
I'm going to put it in.

2096
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:12,840
I'm going to put it in.

2097
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,840
One, two.

2098
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,840
I'm sorry.

2099
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:17,840
I'm sorry.

2100
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:19,840
I'm sorry.

2101
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:21,840
Are you ready?

2102
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:27,840
To defeat HameHameHadai,

2103
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:31,840
I will defeat HameHameHadai.

2104
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,840
Until the last drop.

2105
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:44,840
The last one.

2106
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,840
I slept a lot.

2107
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:51,840
OK, OK!

2108
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:54,840
Go! Go!

2109
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,840
It's gone.

2110
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:28,840
It's gone.

2111
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:38,840
I got it. Please.

2112
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:41,840
I got it.

2113
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:13,840
I'm scared.

2114
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:15,840
I'm scared.

2115
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:39,840
I'm scared.

2116
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,840
Oh my god!

2117
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:43,840
It's stuck here.

2118
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:47,840
It's too hard.

2119
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:49,840
It's melted.

2120
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:53,840
Is it that hard?

2121
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:01,840
It's hot.

2122
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:33,840
I'm sorry.

2123
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:42,840
I'm sorry.

2124
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:48,840
I'm so sorry.

2125
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,840
I'm so sorry.

2126
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:59,840
I'm so tired.

2127
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:01,840
I'm so tired.

2128
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:17,840
Do you feel like taking a bath?

2129
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,840
I'm so hot.

2130
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:24,840
Yay!

2131
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:26,840
I did it!

2132
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:30,840
Here I go!

2133
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:31,840
Here I go!

2134
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:33,840
One, two, three!

2135
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:35,840
Wow, you're pretty good!

2136
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,840
You're right!

2137
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:38,840
Don't cry.

2138
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,840
Don't cry.

2139
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:47,840
Don't cry.

2140
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:53,840
Ouch!

2141
02:42:56,840 --> 02:42:57,840
No!

2142
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:02,840
No!

2143
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:04,840
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2144
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:08,840
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2145
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:19,840
It hurts. It hurts.

2146
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:23,840
Go home, go home, go home.

2147
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:25,840
Wow, that's a lot.

2148
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:27,840
Are you full?

2149
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,840
I'm scared.

2150
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:31,840
Hurry up.

2151
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:33,840
Hurry up.

2152
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:41,840
What are you doing?

2153
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,840
I feel good.

2154
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:19,840
Let's take a picture.

2155
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,840
Do you want to eat together?

2156
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:40,840
Let's eat together.

2157
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:43,840
You can do it, you can do it!

2158
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:49,840
It's hard to take a picture because there are so many people in front of me.

2159
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:51,840
I'm sorry.

2160
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,840
I'm sorry.

2161
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:55,840

02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:05,840
I'm sorry.

2167
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:07,840
I'm sorry.

2168
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:09,840
I'm sorry.

2169
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:11,840
I'm sorry.

2170
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:13,840
How do you feel?

2171
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,840
I feel like this.

2172
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:28,840
Look at me.

2173
02:45:28,840 --> 02:45:30,840
Haichan.

2174
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:02,840
I'm sorry.

2175
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:15,840
I'm sorry.

2176
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,840
I'm sorry.

2177
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:21,840
I'm sorry.

2178
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:28,840
Ouch! Ouch!

2179
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:30,840
It's so close!

2180
02:46:58,840 --> 02:47:01,840
I'm going to stop them.

2181
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:05,840
It's coming out.

2182
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:37,840
Let's get out of here!

2183
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:39,840
I'm hungry.

2184
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:42,840
I'm hungry.

2185
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:44,840
I'm hungry.

2186
02:49:51,840 --> 02:49:54,840
I want to grow up.

2187
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:56,840
I'm so hungry.

2188
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:28,840
How do you feel?

2189
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:32,840
I feel like I'm getting bigger.

2190
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:07,840
I can't do it anymore.

2191
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:21,840
I can't do it anymore.

2192
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:23,840
I'm so scared.

2193
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:28,840
I'm so scared.

2194
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:39,840
I'm so scared.

2195
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:40,840
I'm sorry.

2196
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:50,840
I'm sorry.

2197
02:51:52,840 --> 02:51:54,840
I'm sorry.

2198
02:51:56,840 --> 02:51:58,840
I'm sorry.

2199
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:04,840
Say it louder!

2200
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:36,840
It's a big one.

2201
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:38,840
Run away!

2202
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:40,840
It's coming out.

2203
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:42,840
It's coming out.

2204
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:44,840
It's coming out.

2205
02:52:44,840 --> 02:52:45,840
Let's go!

2206
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:47,840
Let's go inside.

2207
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:52,840
Let's go together.

2208
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:54,840
Bye-bye!

2209
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:24,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

2210
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:31,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

2211
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:38,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

2212
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:10,840
I want to lick the chinchu.

2213
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:17,840
Ah, it feels good.

2214
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:27,840
It feels good.

2215
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:31,840
I want to lick the chinchu.

2216
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:33,840
Oh, no.

2217
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:36,840
Oh, no.

2218
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:39,840
Go, go, go, go, go.

2219
02:55:44,840 --> 02:55:46,840
I'm so tired.

2220
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:49,840
I'm so tired.

2221
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:55,080
I feel terrible...

2222
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:22,840
Oh, it's okay.

2223
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:23,840
It's okay.

2224
03:01:23,840 --> 03:01:24,840
It's okay.

2225
03:01:24,840 --> 03:01:27,840
You are a good boy.

2226
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:30,840
It's okay.

2227
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:32,840
Are you okay?

2228
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:33,840
Don't cry.

2229
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:35,840
Are you okay?

2230
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:46,840
It's okay.

2231
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:48,840
Stop!

2232
03:02:57,640 --> 03:02:58,840
Black pergunta 1

2233
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:00,140
Black pregunta 2

2234
03:03:04,140 --> 03:03:06,140
A good challenge

2235
03:03:06,140 --> 03:03:07,640
From this part

2236
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:07,640
I didn't suffer

2237
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:08,140
Yep

2238
03:03:08,140 --> 03:03:08,640
From this part

2239
03:03:08,640 --> 03:03:10,640
Oh, no, no, no, no!

2240
03:03:11,640 --> 03:03:12,640
It's a little too much.

2241
03:03:12,640 --> 03:03:14,640
It's a little too much.

2242
03:03:15,640 --> 03:03:17,640
It's too much.

2243
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:19,640
What is this?

2244
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:21,640
What is this?

2245
03:04:21,640 --> 03:04:23,640
What is this?

2246
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:25,640
What is this?

2247
03:04:25,640 --> 03:04:27,640
It's the other way around.

2248
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:50,640
10 seconds left!

2249
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:52,640
10 seconds left!

2250
03:04:52,640 --> 03:04:54,640
I'm scared.

2251
03:04:54,640 --> 03:04:56,640
This is fun.

2252
03:04:56,640 --> 03:04:58,640
You have ten seconds left.

2253
03:04:58,640 --> 03:05:00,640
I'm scared.

2254
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:02,640
I'm scared.

2255
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:04,640
It's a running car.

2256
03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:06,640
I'm scared.

2257
03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:10,640
I'm scared.

2258
03:05:10,640 --> 03:05:12,640
I can't stand it.

2259
03:05:12,640 --> 03:05:14,640
Ah!

2260
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:16,640
Ah!

2261
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:20,640
Ah!

2262
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:54,640
Thank you very much.

2263
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:58,640
Thank you very much.

2264
03:05:58,640 --> 03:06:02,640
Thank you very much.

2265
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:34,640
What happened?

2266
03:06:34,640 --> 03:06:36,640
What happened?

2267
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:38,640
It's not like that.

2268
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:40,640
That's right.

2269
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:42,640
You have to get closer.

2270
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:44,640
Is that so?

2271
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:46,640
What happened?

2272
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:48,640
What happened?

2273
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:50,640
What happened?

2274
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:52,640
What happened?

2275
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:54,640
What happened?

2276
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:56,640
What happened?

2277
03:06:56,640 --> 03:06:58,640
What happened?

2278
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:00,640
What happened?

2279
03:07:00,640 --> 03:07:02,640
Thank you very much.

2280
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:04,640
Thank you very much.

2281
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:06,640
Thank you very much.

2282
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:08,640
Please put your face together.

2283
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:10,640
Thank you very much.

2284
03:07:10,640 --> 03:07:12,640
Mako Bus is the best!

2285
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:14,640
The best!

2286
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:16,640
The best!

2287
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:18,640
3rd place!

2288
03:07:38,640 --> 03:07:40,640
Thank you for your hard work.

2289
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:44,640
Thank you very much.

2290
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:47,640
Thank you for your hard work.

2291
03:07:55,640 --> 03:07:57,640
Bakumatsu is the best!

2292
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:03,640
Thank you for your hard work.

2293
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:11,640
I wanted to do more.

2294
03:08:11,640 --> 03:08:12,640
It was fun.

2295
03:08:12,640 --> 03:08:14,640
My legs are shaking.

2296
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:16,640
My legs are shaking.

2297
03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:18,640
I almost fell asleep.

2298
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:20,640
I'm sorry.

2299
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:22,640
Three people.

2300
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:24,640
I'm sorry.

2301
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:26,640
I'm sorry.

2302
03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:28,640
I'm sorry.

2303
03:08:28,640 --> 03:08:30,640
I'm sorry.

2304
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:32,640
I'm sorry.

2305
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:34,640
I'm sorry.

2306
03:08:34,640 --> 03:08:36,640
I'm sorry.

2307
03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:38,640
I'm sorry.

2308
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:40,640
I'm sorry.

2309
03:08:40,640 --> 03:08:42,640
I put it in my stomach.

2310
03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:44,640
How was it?

2311
03:08:44,640 --> 03:08:46,640
It was so much fun.

2312
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:48,640
It was so much fun.

2313
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:50,640
How was it?

2314
03:08:50,640 --> 03:08:52,640
Can I put it in my stomach?

2315
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:54,640
Yes, you can.

2316
03:08:54,640 --> 03:08:56,640
Really?

2317
03:09:00,640 --> 03:09:02,640
It's cold.

2318
03:09:02,640 --> 03:09:04,640
It's cold.

2319
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:06,640
It's cold.

2320
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:08,640
I'm scared!

2321
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:10,640
I'm scared!

2322
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:43,640
What is this?

2323
03:10:57,640 --> 03:11:00,640
The rhythm is good.

2324
03:11:00,640 --> 03:11:02,640
It's fun.

2325
03:11:02,640 --> 03:11:03,640
I'm 45 years old.

2326
03:11:13,640 --> 03:11:15,640
It's my second time today.

2327
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:22,640
I wanted to do more.

2328
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:23,640
Who is it?

2329
03:11:31,640 --> 03:11:32,640
Who is it?

2330
03:11:37,640 --> 03:11:38,640
Who is it?

2331
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:50,640
I touched something with my hand.

2332
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:52,640
What?

2333
03:11:52,640 --> 03:11:54,640
It's not a bump!

2334
03:11:54,640 --> 03:11:56,640
It's a bump!

2335
03:11:56,640 --> 03:11:58,640
It's a bump!

2336
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:00,640
It's a bump!

2337
03:12:00,640 --> 03:12:02,640
I'm filming.

2338
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:04,640
I feel like I've done it today.

2339
03:12:04,640 --> 03:12:06,640
I can sleep well.

2340
03:12:06,640 --> 03:12:08,640
That's right.

2341
03:12:08,640 --> 03:12:10,640
Thank you.

2342
03:12:10,640 --> 03:12:12,640
Let me find it.

2343
03:12:12,640 --> 03:12:14,640
My back is right.

2344
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:16,640
Thank you very much.

2345
03:12:17,640 --> 03:12:19,640
Thank you very much.

2346
03:12:31,640 --> 03:12:33,640

2347
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:38,640
Pata-chan is here!

2348
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:40,640
What?

2349
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:41,640
Ega-san!

2350
03:12:44,140 --> 03:12:45,140
I got it!

2351
03:12:45,140 --> 03:12:46,640
Thank you so much!

2352
03:12:47,140 --> 03:12:48,640
Look, I'm happy that you got it.

2353
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:50,140
Thank you so much!

2354
03:12:51,140 --> 03:12:52,140
One more time!

2355
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:53,640
Okay, one more time!

2356
03:12:53,640 --> 03:12:54,640
Okay!

2357
03:12:55,140 --> 03:12:56,640
Look, the other side!

2358
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:57,640
Let's go!

2359
03:12:58,140 --> 03:12:59,140
Ready, go!

2360
03:13:03,140 --> 03:13:04,640
Thank you so much!

2361
03:13:06,140 --> 03:13:08,640
Well, I did a lot of work today.

2362
03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:10,640
I don't know.

2363
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:11,640
Why?

2364
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:12,640
I don't know.

2365
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:13,640
I don't know anything.

2366
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:14,640
Why?

2367
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:26,640
One, two.

2368
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:29,640
Bakobasu.

2369
03:13:29,640 --> 03:13:31,640
BAKOBASU

2370
03:13:39,640 --> 03:13:41,640

One, two, three!

2373
03:13:43,640 --> 03:13:47,640
Our bodies and hearts became naked!

2374
03:13:47,640 --> 03:13:50,640
BAKOBASU is the best!

2375
03:13:53,640 --> 03:13:54,640

Yes, I do.

2381
03:14:04,640 --> 03:14:05,640
Thank you for the food.

2382
03:14:05,640 --> 03:14:06,640

03:14:30,640 --> 03:14:31,640
The best!

2394

The next challenger is Arata in front of the TV!

03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:51,640
One, two!

2403
03:14:51,640 --> 03:14:53,640
Makobashi is the best!

2404
03:14:53,640 --> 03:14:55,640
Bye-bye!

2405
03:14:57,640 --> 03:14:59,640
Oh my god!

Thank you very much!

2415
03:15:13,640 --> 03:15:15,640
I made a plan for the first time in my life!

2416
03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:17,640
I got it!

2417
03:15:17,640 --> 03:15:18,640
One, two!

2418
03:15:18,640 --> 03:15:20,640
Bakumatsu is the best!

2419
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:21,640
Thank you very much!

2420
03:15:21,640 --> 03:15:24,640
We had a great time today!

2421
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:25,640
Thank you very much!

2422
03:15:25,640 --> 03:15:27,640
Makobasu is the best!

2423
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:30,640
This is what's left.

2424
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:33,640
We just became a couple.

2425
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:36,640
We will be happy from now on.

2426
03:15:38,640 --> 03:15:40,640
Makobasu is the best!

2427
03:15:46,640 --> 03:15:48,640
Makobasu is the best!

2428
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:50,640
Fusion Ha!

2429
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:55,640
I love Bakobasu!

2430
03:15:55,640 --> 03:15:59,640
Thank you! It was fun!

2431
03:15:59,640 --> 03:16:02,640
Bakobasu is the best!

2432
03:16:03,640 --> 03:16:04,640
Bye bye!

2433
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:07,640
Bakobasu is the best!

2434
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:09,640
It's so hot!

2435
03:16:13,640 --> 03:16:15,640
Makobashi is the worst!

2436
03:16:19,640 --> 03:16:22,640
It's been a very hot two days.

2437
03:16:22,640 --> 03:16:25,640
How was it for the two of you?

2438
03:16:27,640 --> 03:16:29,640
Wasn't it hard for you?

2439
03:16:29,640 --> 03:16:31,640
That's right.

2440
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:35,640
This time, it was the front and the back.

2441
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:40,140
I was nervous at the beginning, so I thought it was going to be tough.

2442
03:16:40,140 --> 03:16:45,040
Well, it was tough this time, but everyone had a great time this time.

2443
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:46,740
It was a lot of fun.

2444
03:16:46,740 --> 03:16:51,640
As Hata-chan said, everyone had a good time.

2445
03:16:51,640 --> 03:16:56,740
I was the first one to be left to the supervisor.

2446
03:16:56,740 --> 03:17:09,340
I like people who get excited rather than pulling it out, so I think I was excited for these two days.

2447
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:12,980
Everyone was excited, wasn't it?

2448
03:17:12,980 --> 03:17:21,860
If you want to go out, please go to this place.

2449
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:28,200
It may not come out, but if you want to come out, please do it until here.

2450
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:29,960
Then you may be able to come out.

2451
03:17:29,960 --> 03:17:33,240
It may be a very fun two-day trip.

2452
03:17:33,240 --> 03:17:37,240
So everyone, see you next time.

2453
03:17:37,240 --> 03:17:42,120
Good-bye.

2454
03:17:42,120 --> 03:17:44,520
Bye-bye.

2455
03:17:44,520 --> 03:17:46,520
This is Tsubomi.

2456
03:17:46,520 --> 03:17:51,000
This time, I had a lot of fun.

2457
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:59,320
It was the first time I met a good girl, but I was happy that everyone was kind to me.

2458
03:17:59,320 --> 03:18:04,480
I was able to get along well with the boys and had a good time.

2459
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:06,760
I want to go out again. Thank you very much.

2460
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:12,480
I'm Ayu Sakurai.

2461
03:18:12,480 --> 03:18:19,160
The last Daeranko, the Daeranko where everyone gathers,

2462
03:18:19,160 --> 03:18:23,160
As expected of Aya, I was overwhelmed.

2463
03:18:23,160 --> 03:18:26,160
It was a very fun 2nd period.

2464
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:27,160
Thank you.

2465
03:18:30,160 --> 03:18:32,160
I'm Kanaeruka.

2466
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:39,160
This time, I was able to participate in the Bakowa Bakowa Tour for the first time.

2467
03:18:39,160 --> 03:18:42,160
At first, I didn't know anything.

2468
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:45,160
It was really fun to actually start it.

2469
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:47,160
It became a memory.

2470
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:48,160
It was fun.

2471
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:50,160
Thank you so much.

2472
03:18:50,160 --> 03:18:52,160
I'm Kanaruka.

2473
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:54,160
Bye-bye.

2474
03:18:54,160 --> 03:18:56,160
Hi, I'm Hata-chan.

2475
03:18:56,160 --> 03:19:00,160
I came to Wakubasu this time.

2476
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:02,160
I didn't do any spy work.

2477
03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:04,160
I was having fun.

2478
03:19:04,160 --> 03:19:06,160
I had a lot of fun.

2479
03:19:06,160 --> 03:19:12,160
I hope I can come to Wakubasu again next year.

2480
03:19:12,160 --> 03:19:14,160
At that time, thank you everyone.

2481
03:19:14,160 --> 03:19:16,160
Thank you very much this time.

2482
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:18,160
Bye bye!

2483
03:19:18,160 --> 03:19:20,160
I'm Oto Hananase.

2484
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:24,160
This is my first time in Bakobasu.

2485
03:19:24,160 --> 03:19:30,160
I was so nervous because it was my first time shooting at a parking lot.

2486
03:19:30,160 --> 03:19:32,160
It was a lot of fun.

2487
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:34,160
Bye!

2488
03:19:34,160 --> 03:19:37,160
I'm Aichi Kotoe Uehara Ai.

2489
03:19:37,160 --> 03:19:42,160
This is my third time in Bakobasu.

2490
03:19:42,160 --> 03:19:48,160
Every year, the actresses are very luxurious, and they are all great actresses.

2491
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:53,160
I had a great time this year, and I had a lot of fun.

2492
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:55,160
I would like to appear again next year.

2493
03:19:55,160 --> 03:19:59,160
At that time, please apply to Bakobasu a lot.

2494
03:19:59,160 --> 03:20:01,160
Bye bye.

2495
03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:04,160
I'm Maya Kawamura.

2496
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:09,160
This time, I was very nervous because it was my first time participating in Bakobasu.

2497
03:20:09,160 --> 03:20:20,160
I had a hard time, but it was a very good memory, and I think it was a good sense of accomplishment that I was able to do it with everyone.

2498
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:22,160
Thank you very much. It was fun.

2499
03:20:22,160 --> 03:20:24,160
Bye-bye.

2500
03:20:24,160 --> 03:20:26,160
I'm Megumi Shina.

2501
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:32,160
Did you watch this video from the beginning to the end without missing it?

2502
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:34,160
It was amazing.

2503
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:38,660
What I just thought was, how many shots did I get?

2504
03:20:38,660 --> 03:20:42,660
If you don't know, please count and tell me.

2505
03:20:43,660 --> 03:20:47,660
Please look forward to next year's MAKOBASHI.

2506
03:20:47,660 --> 03:20:49,660
Thank you very much.

2507
03:20:50,660 --> 03:20:52,660
I'm KURUBU GIMIKAN.

2508
03:20:55,660 --> 03:20:58,660
This is the first time I've been on MAKOBASHI.

2509
03:20:58,660 --> 03:21:03,660
I don't think there's anyone else who's as fun as I am.

2510
03:21:06,660 --> 03:21:08,660
I'm Maki Hara Mara.

2511
03:21:09,660 --> 03:21:13,660
I debuted with a famous girl.

2512
03:21:13,660 --> 03:21:18,660
I've been working with her for less than a year now.

2513
03:21:18,660 --> 03:21:20,660
I'm very happy.

2514
03:21:20,660 --> 03:21:26,660
I've had a lot of opportunities to interact with fans.

2515
03:21:26,660 --> 03:21:30,660
I had a lot of fun today.

2516
03:21:30,660 --> 03:21:32,660
Thank you very much.

2517
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:34,660
Bye-bye.

2518
03:21:34,660 --> 03:21:36,660
I'm Ichika Kamihata.

2519
03:21:36,660 --> 03:21:39,660
This is my first time to participate in Mako Bus.

2520
03:21:39,660 --> 03:21:43,660
It's my first time to film with so many girls.

2521
03:21:43,660 --> 03:21:46,660
At first, I was so nervous that my legs were shaking.

2522
03:21:46,660 --> 03:21:48,660
I had a lot of fun for two days.

2523
03:21:48,660 --> 03:21:50,660
Thank you very much.

2524
03:21:50,660 --> 03:21:52,660
Bye-bye.

2525
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:54,660
I'm Mao Hamasaki.

2526
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:58,660
I'm Ichika-chan and this is the first time I'm taking part in this event.

2527
03:22:00,660 --> 03:22:03,660
I was able to experience a lot of things that I couldn't experience before.

2528
03:22:03,660 --> 03:22:07,660
It was a lot of fun to ride the water slide with everyone.

2529
03:22:07,660 --> 03:22:13,660
Please let me know what you think about it.

2530
03:22:15,660 --> 03:22:17,660
I'm Hikaru Kona.

2531
03:22:18,660 --> 03:22:22,660
This is my first time taking part in this event.

2532
03:22:22,660 --> 03:22:26,660
It was my first time at ZUK-SHI and I had a lot of different experiences.

2533
03:22:26,660 --> 03:22:30,660
It was like a girls' high school and I had a lot of fun.

2534
03:22:30,660 --> 03:22:34,660
I had a lot of fun talking to a lot of people.

2535
03:22:34,660 --> 03:22:38,660
Of course, it was a lot of fun.

2536
03:22:38,660 --> 03:22:43,660
If I have a chance again, I want to participate in something like this!

2537
03:22:43,660 --> 03:22:45,660
Yes!

2538
03:22:45,660 --> 03:22:47,660
Yes!

2539
03:22:47,660 --> 03:22:49,660
Bye bye!

2540
03:22:49,660 --> 03:22:51,660
I'm Riku Minato.

2541
03:22:51,660 --> 03:22:53,660
It was my first time to take a bus.

2542
03:22:53,660 --> 03:22:57,660
At first, I didn't know what kind of shooting it was.

2543
03:22:57,660 --> 03:23:01,660
It was hard, but it was fun.

2544
03:23:01,660 --> 03:23:03,660
I was bitten by a bug.

2545
03:23:03,660 --> 03:23:07,660
When I woke up in the morning, it was like this.

2546
03:23:07,660 --> 03:23:11,660
Please check it out on VTR.

2547
03:23:11,660 --> 03:23:15,660
I think I had a lot of fun.

2548
03:23:15,660 --> 03:23:19,660
If you like, please try to take a bus next time.

2549
03:23:19,660 --> 03:23:21,660
Thank you very much!

2550
03:23:21,660 --> 03:23:22,660
Bye bye!

2551
03:23:22,660 --> 03:23:24,660
I'm Yuki Natsume.

2552
03:23:26,660 --> 03:23:32,660
I was more nervous than I imagined.

2553
03:23:32,660 --> 03:23:35,660
But each one of us had a lot of fun.

2554
03:23:35,660 --> 03:23:42,660
I had a lot of fun interacting with other people.

2555
03:23:42,660 --> 03:23:45,660
Thank you all for participating.

2556
03:23:45,660 --> 03:23:49,660
Please let me know what you think about the show.

2557
03:23:49,660 --> 03:23:51,660
See you later. Bye bye.

2558
03:23:54,660 --> 03:23:55,660
I'm Abeno Miku.

2559
03:23:57,660 --> 03:23:58,660
This time...

2560
03:23:58,660 --> 03:24:00,660
Wait, this is embarrassing.

2561
03:24:00,660 --> 03:24:03,660
This was my first time participating in the show.

2562
03:24:03,660 --> 03:24:07,660
There were some friends and some friends I met for the first time.

2563
03:24:07,660 --> 03:24:13,660
I had a lot of fun while watching erotic scenes of various people.

2564
03:24:13,660 --> 03:24:23,660
I want to do various things and have a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to your feedback on Twitter.

2565
03:24:23,660 --> 03:24:26,660
So, bye-bye!

2566
03:24:26,660 --> 03:24:29,660
Thank you for your hard work.

2567
03:24:29,660 --> 03:24:34,660
I just want to improve my clothes a little more.

2568
03:24:34,660 --> 03:24:38,660
I always wonder if I can't do it at the same time.

2569
03:24:38,660 --> 03:24:44,660
I'd like you to upgrade the box a little more.

2570
03:24:44,660 --> 03:24:46,660
That's what I think.

2571
03:24:46,660 --> 03:24:47,660
That's all.

2572
03:24:47,660 --> 03:24:50,660
I also wanted a shell swimsuit at the end.

2573
03:24:50,660 --> 03:24:54,660
I'd like you to make my outfit like this.

2574
03:24:54,660 --> 03:24:56,660
Thank you very much.

2575
03:24:56,660 --> 03:24:57,660

It was a two-day trip that I fell in love with Yui Hatano.

2584
03:25:21,660 --> 03:25:23,660

2591
03:25:50,660 --> 03:25:52,660
Thank you for the good birthday present.

I'm Suzukawa. I shot 4 shots yesterday.

2594
03:25:59,660 --> 03:26:06,660
I was chosen by Gowako Meadey-Walland, and I was chosen by the last feeling couple.

2595
03:26:06,660 --> 03:26:11,660
It was a journey that I was able to use all my luck. It was very fun. Thank you very much.

2610
03:27:04,660 --> 03:27:06,660
but when I actually saw them, they were even more beautiful.

2611
03:27:06,660 --> 03:27:08,660
I was able to get involved with such women.

2612
03:27:08,660 --> 03:27:10,660
It was a really famous time. Thank you very much.

2618
03:27:28,660 --> 03:27:36,660

I was able to shoot only four shots.

2628
03:28:09,660 --> 03:28:14,660
I made a personal mistake and I was involved in the middle.

2629
03:28:14,660 --> 03:28:18,660
I was really bothered by the director and the staff.

2630
