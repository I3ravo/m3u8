1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,640
This is the end of the last
month's Bon Odori report.

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,480
Since the number of participants
has increased since last year,

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,900
I am very happy as a mayor.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,880
Next, Aoyama-san, please
read the accounting report.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,120
Yes, I will read the accounting report.

6
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:45,281
I'm going to read the first
part of the letter to you.

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,660
High-heat bill for public buildings.

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Execution fee.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,080
Electricity 6,059 yen.

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,120
Gas.

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,320
3,260 yen.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,300
I married my husband

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,460
and started living in this town.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,920
It's been about three years.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,600
Instead of my husband,
who was busy with work,

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,040
I was a member of the board of directors.

17
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,041
I used to be a warden.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,720
I didn't really want to be a
warden because it was a hassle,

19
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:21,317
but I was asked to do it
because there were no

20
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,780
other people, and I
took it for a long time.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,820
Well, now that we're
here, let's take a break.

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,540
That's right.

23
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,541
That's right.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,200
But, you know,

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,660
I found out after participating in the
board meeting that it costs a lot of money.

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,340
Well, it can't be helped.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
The board doesn't take care of the details.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,840
I see.

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,440
By the way, Mr. Aoyama,

30
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:05,641
Ms. Aoyama, have you got used to the
activities of the neighborhood association?

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,380
Yes, I have. I can't do anything, but
everyone is kind enough to teach me.

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,436
No, no. It is very helpful
for the neighborhood

33
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:20,020
association that Ms.
Aoyama has come.

34
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,200
She will handle the accounting properly.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,780
Ms. Aoyama, do you have any qualifications?
Like a weapon?

36
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,280
Oh, well, it's just a second-class weapon.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,560
Oh, that's amazing.

38
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,320
No, no, it's not that big of a deal.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
Oh, Mr. Sugiura.

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,880
By the way, today is the
end of the month, isn't it?

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
What should I do?

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,220
The usual thing.

43
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,480
Oh, that's right.

44
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,080
It was the end of the month.

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,180
What's the matter?

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,380
I always have a drinking
party after the end of the month.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,020
It's like a breather.

48
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,960
Oh, is it a drinking party?

49
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:18,961
Is that so?

50
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
Oh, that's right.

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,540
Ms. Aoyama, if you don't mind,

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,220
would you like to join
us after this? Oh, no, I.

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,160
..

54
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,080
I have some shopping to do.

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Since we're here,

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,340
let's go for a ride once in a while.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,440
Oh, of course,

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
we don't need money.

59
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,900
We'll pay for it.

60
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:50,380
I'd like you to have a drink
with me, even if it's just a little bit.

61
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,381
How about it?

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,960
Even if it's just one drink.

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,860
Well, just a little bit.

64
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,280
Well, just a little bit.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,420
Well, Mr. Aoyama will join us today.

66
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,046
I'm not good at refusing, so
I decided to participate in a

67
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:18,800
drinking party with the members
of the neighborhood association.

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,290
Let's drink to the further development
of the neighborhood association!

69
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,630
Cheers!

70
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:36,631
Cheers! It's so good.

71
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,890


72
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,010
The alcohol after work is so special.

73
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,410
Yes, it is.

74
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,250
Aoyama-san, do you drink
alcohol often? Yes, I do.

75
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,290
My husband likes alcohol,
so I drink it sometimes.

76
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,570
I see.

77
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,410
But I envy your husband.

78
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,870
He can drink with such a beautiful wife.

79
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,670
No, it's not like that.

80
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,090
You're right, Chairman.

81
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,630
By the way, do you have any children?

82
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,470
No, I don't have any children yet.

83
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:34,510
Oh, I see.

84
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,830
If I were a beautiful wife like Aoyama-san,

85
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,190
I would do something like
making children every day.

86
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,630
Hey, hey, hey!

87
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,870
Ayame-san, that's a bad habit.

88
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,670
It's easy to drink.

89
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,410
No, no.

90
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,130
It's not good to drink at the table.

91
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,470
You said you could drink a
little, but you can drink a lot.

92
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,890
No, no.

93
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,290
Do you often drink like this?

94
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,970
Yes, at the end of the month.

95
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,390
At the end of the month, we always drink.

96
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,690
I see.

97
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,610
Let's drink together at
the end of the month.

98
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,611
Let's go together.

99
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,110
I want to go with you.

100
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,970
What do you like?

101
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,610
I like red wine the most.

102
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,110
I can drink anything.

103
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,350
How do you get
drunk? I don't know.

104
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,870


105
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,590
I am told that I don't change much.

106
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,050
I don't care.

107
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,770
You are strong.

108
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,790
It's a rare opportunity,
so let's have another toast.

109
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,470
Cheers!

110
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,310
Good, good, good.

111
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,490
It's a good drink.

112
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,890
Master, would you like a drink?

113
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,310
I haven't drunk it yet.

114
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,810
I'll treat you today.

115
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,810
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,470
But it's expensive,
isn't it? It's okay.

117
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,670


118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,590
There is a deposit for that.

119
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,950
You don't have to worry about it.

120
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,730
Here you are.

121
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,290
One more time.

122
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:49,220
I can't drink anymore.

123
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
What?

124
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,740
Mr. Aoyama, you have a great style.

125
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,620
Did you do any sports?

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
No.

127
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,530
You have a great sense of fashion.

128
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,570
I want to do something about
my unyielding personality.

129
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:23,488
It's been a long time since I had a drink,
and I had a lot of fun, and I was drunk when I

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:32,530
noticed that I was drunk by the president of
the district who was good at making me drink.

131
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:33,531
But there was a problem.

132
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,810
I'm gonna win with 3-8.

133
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,610
3-7... I can't win with 3-8.

134
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,330
This weekend, I'm gonna win.

135
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,130
I'm looking forward to it.

136
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,590
If you win, please treat me.

137
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,430
Oh?

138
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,010
You fell asleep?

139
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,510
Aoyama-san, Aoyama-san.

140
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,290
What's up, Kaizo? I fell asleep.

141
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,710


142
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,430
What? Aoyama-san.

143
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,370


144
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,750
Aoyama-san, did you fall asleep?

145
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,890
The night is just beginning.

146
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,430
Aoyama-san, Aoyama-san.

147
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:29,520
Aoyama-san, I've been waiting for you.

148
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,640
Aoyama-san, please come in.

149
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
What's the matter?

150
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,730
He wants to go to the bathroom.

151
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,770
I've invited him to the bathroom.

152
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,230
Please let him in.

153
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,730
Have fun.

154
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,110
Aoyama-san, I'll take you to the bathroom.

155
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,450
Be careful.

156
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,150
Are you all right?

157
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,231
The bathroom is over there.

158
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:16,170
Are you all right, Aoyama-san?

159
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,310
I'll take you to the bathroom.

160
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:13,220
Are you all right, Aoyama-san?

161
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:32,030
Are you all right, Aoyama-san?

162
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,360
What are you doing?

163
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,720
Are you all right?

164
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:30,100
What are you doing? Don't worry.

165
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,500
I will release Aoyama-san.

166
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,540
Be quiet.

167
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,310
Don't do that.

168
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,430
Be quiet.

169
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,430
It's okay. I'm going to release you.

170
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,530
Today, I'm going to show you
how to make a cute cat mask.

171
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,746
I'm going to show you how
to make a cute cat mask.

172
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:10,050
I'm going to show you how
to make a cute cat mask.

173
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,340
You are very wet, aren't you?

174
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:35,920
I'll take care of you.

175
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,020
Hey, Aoyama-san,
it's hard for you, isn't it?

176
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,920
Instead of your husband, you attend the
meeting of the neighborhood association.

177
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,260
But why are you so wet, Aoyama-san?

178
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,261
What are you doing?

179
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,060
Look, you are messy.

180
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,560
Maybe you have a lot of complaints.

181
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Look.

182
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,320
I'll cool you down.

183
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,710
Aoyama-san

184
00:18:45,600 --> 00:19:13,720
I'll make you feel good.

185
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,840
I can't.

186
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,820
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

187
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,100
Don't worry.

188
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:01,080
I will heal you.

189
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,180
You have a nice butt.

190
00:21:24,400 --> 00:23:13,240
I can't do it.

191
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,960
I'm so tired.

192
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm so tired.

193
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:28,921
I'm going to die.

194
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,160
The movement of the waist is amazing.

195
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:11,161
Oh, it feels good.

196
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:54,280
I can feel the movement of my lower back.

197
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
It's amazing, isn't it?

198
00:27:35,470 --> 00:28:00,110
Oh, it feels good.

199
00:28:36,780 --> 00:29:06,758
I woke up from a drink and
was stunned to find that my

200
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:35,650
disordered self was covered
with a man's body fluid.

201
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Cheers!

202
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
Cheers! It's delicious.

203
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,220
It's the best.

204
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,080
By the way, Kyo-chan, did
you watch soccer? Yes, I did.

205
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
That's great.

206
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,380
Yes, it is.

207
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,820
It's a big deal, isn't it?

208
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,400
It's a big deal, isn't it?

209
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:10,760
It's a big deal, isn't it?

210
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,760
Since then, drinking parties have
been held frequently in the district.

211
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,110
I should have known that
my husband was there,

212
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,990
but the sexual harassment of the district
chairmen has escalated more and more.

213
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:41,906
I wanted to reject it,
but when I drank alcohol,

214
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:48,990
I became sensitive and
my mind became pure white.

215
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,510
It's really fun today.

216
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,106
I've been in the
neighborhood for a long

217
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:02,810
time, but I'm happy to
drink with Ayama-san.

218
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,500
Hey, Sugino-san, what are you doing?
Where are you touching?

219
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,541
Are you touching anything?

220
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,880
No, I'm not touching anything.

221
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
It's just my imagination.

222
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,080
But you're touching it, Mr. Sugiyama.

223
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
It's not good.

224
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,100
It's a private bar, so it's okay.

225
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,000
I have to speak up.

226
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,520
And, Mr.

227
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:46,000
Aoyama, I like you very much.

228
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,300
No, you don't.

229
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,301
Please don't.

230
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,860
You were so hot the other day.

231
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,060
And you were shaking your hips.

232
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,500
I didn't do that.

233
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,060
I don't remember.

234
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
Don't lie to me.

235
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:08,601
I can't believe it.

236
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,650
She is so beautiful.

237
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,540
Mr. Sugiyama, it's terrible.

238
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,960
Did you have sex with Ms.

239
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,310
Aoyama? I had fun today, too.

240
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:33,311
Ms. Aoyama,

241
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,870
if you didn't, you wouldn't come
to the drinking party, would you?

242
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,910
You're already wet, aren't you?

243
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,150
Ms. Aoyama.

244
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,950
No, it can't be true.

245
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:02,200
You are going to sleep.

246
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,480
You have a lot of sleep today.

247
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,950
I can't sleep here.

248
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,530
If you make a sound, you will be eaten.

249
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,880
Let's enjoy today.

250
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,220
I can't do it.

251
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
It's okay.

252
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:08,920
I can't do it.

253
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,320
You want to do it, don't
you? Let's have fun.

254
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:29,060
Are you okay? A little.

255
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,920


256
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,340
Are you okay? I'm fine.

257
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Oh, my God.

258
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620


259
00:34:45,250 --> 00:35:15,390
I want you to laugh.

260
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,450
Oh, my God.

261
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,990
I'm nervous.

262
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,650
I'm fine.

263
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:34,860
What should I do if
you get angry? I'm fine.

264
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,540


265
00:35:39,400 --> 00:36:02,740
If you don't make a sound,
no one will come, so be quiet.

266
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,150
Someone will come.

267
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,320
When you make a sound,

268
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:29,820
let's take this off.

269
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,400
If you take this off, you don't
want anyone to come, do you?

270
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,910
It's good, isn't it?

271
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:02,911
You are very wet.

272
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,470
You are easy to get wet.

273
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You are wet.

274
00:38:41,040 --> 00:39:09,380
Don't make a sound.

275
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,830
You are wet.

276
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,490
No, I'm not.

277
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
Are you sure?

278
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,700
Bye.

279
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,680
Please calm down.

280
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:35,270
What are you going to do?

281
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,690
You really want it, don't you?

282
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,380
Please put your hip here.

283
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,560
No, it's not good here.

284
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,370
Let's go.

285
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,600
It's in.

286
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:24,220
Nojima-san, you have to be quiet.

287
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,560
It's messy.

288
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
Drink some sake.

289
00:47:44,450 --> 00:48:22,130
It feels good, doesn't it?

290
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,790
Nojima-san, how is it?

291
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,090
It feels good, doesn't it?

292
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,160
Let's have a lot of fun today.

293
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,630
Come on, get up here.

294
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:48,660
Come on, come on.

295
00:50:51,920 --> 00:51:21,870
Your nipples are like this.

296
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,800
You like it, don't you?

297
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:41,170
You were shaking your
hips last time, weren't you?

298
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,210
It's OK to shake your hips.

299
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Come here.

300
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,160
You don't have to be afraid.

301
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:49,560
It's OK, isn't it? Please go.

302
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,760


303
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:09,880
Nojima-san, it's not
fair to go ahead of me.

304
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,460
I'm sorry.

305
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:20,470
You want me, don't you?

306
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,660
Do you want me?

307
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,760
So, this is the process of making a shushi.

308
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:01,380
I don't think there is any particular
problem, but how about checking it out?

309
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,760
Yes, it is within the budget.

310
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:20,180
There is a reservation fee, but this fee is
the same as usual, so it's okay, isn't it?

311
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,668
Then, I would like
to tell you about this

312
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,620
in the interior of the
church, so thank you.

313
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,240
Yes, thank you.

314
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,260
Well, that's all for today's meeting.

315
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,160
Thank you for your hard work.

316
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,060
Thank you for your hard work.

317
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,320
So, let's go to the usual bar after this.

318
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,020
Yes, let's go.

319
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,080
Aoyama-san, of course, you're going, right?

320
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,960
No, I'm going home.

321
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:55,961
I'm coming.

322
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,660
Can you go home? Aoyama-san.

323
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,840


324
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Yes.

325
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,300
Are you going home already?

326
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,500
Aren't you going to the drinking party?

327
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,640
I was looking forward to it.

328
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,780
I can't go to the drinking party anymore.

329
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,820
I see.

330
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
I'm sorry.

331
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,980
I've heard a lot from the president.

332
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:54,240
I'm sorry.
I know you're doing something erotic.

333
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,220
What?

334
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,160
I'll keep it a secret from my husband,
so please keep it a secret from me, too.

335
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,120
In a place like this?

336
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,660
It's not good to do it here.

337
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,900
Just touch me with your hands.

338
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:16,670
Please.

339
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,380
Just touch me with your hands.

340
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,660
It's me.

341
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,230
Are you gay? No, I'm not.

342
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:57,230


343
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,270
I'm fine, aren't I? Please.

344
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,470
Please stop.

345
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:02,630


346
01:05:03,110 --> 01:06:09,510
What will you do if I come again?

347
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,570
I'll let you go right away.

348
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,290
Excuse me.

349
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,490
Do you know such a gay person?

350
01:06:37,310 --> 01:07:03,820
I'm so excited because I'm gay.

351
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:57,720
It's wet.

352
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:08,330
I got it. I'll do it by hand.

353
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:10,530
Please don't.

354
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,210
Are you sure?

355
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,750
Is it OK? Someone will come.

356
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,170
Please wait a little longer.

357
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,630
Can I touch you directly?

358
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,040
I can't stand it.

359
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,880
It's just a little.

360
01:09:36,440 --> 01:10:13,880
Thank you very much. I was very excited.

361
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,840
Would you like to have a mouth?

362
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,370
Someone will come.

363
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:30,327
Someone will come,
so if you do a little, it will

364
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:33,070
be over soon, so please
do it with your mouth.

365
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:37,770
It's just a little.

366
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:38,771
It's a prank.

367
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,480
It's a prank.

368
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,160
You are very good.

369
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,100
Do you feel good?

370
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,420
I feel very good.

371
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,370
You are very good.

372
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:27,930
I'm nervous.

373
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,120
I'm going to make a lot of bread.

374
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,600
Bread is going to come out.

375
01:14:48,601 --> 01:14:51,060
I'm sorry. Can I have my mouth out?

376
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:59,600
I'm afraid I'm going to spit it out.

377
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:32,540
An-san, please.

378
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,820
I couldn't refuse the invitation
from the neighborhood association.

379
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:08,120
I couldn't turn down the
invitation, so I went on a leisure trip.

380
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:17,040
It was good to come to the hot spring for a
night or two to express my daily gratitude,

381
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:23,480
but the old men were looking
at me with a round mind.

382
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:25,340
The hotel was facing me.

383
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:33,640
As soon as I arrived at the hotel,
the drinking party began again.

384
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,780
Cheers!

385
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:48,360
Mr. Aoyama, please try this.

386
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:51,100
It's a local delicacy.

387
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,520
The rice is delicious, too.

388
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,940
I want to come here often.

389
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,430
How is it? It's good.

390
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:06,850
That's good.

391
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:08,610


392
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,800
Aoyama-san, I heard it from Hiroo-san.

393
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,720
I heard you and Hiroo-san
did something erotic.

394
01:18:24,721 --> 01:18:26,720
You seem to have done
a lot of things, don't you?

395
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,540
You are quite a person
who likes to do things.

396
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,100
Today, we came here to travel.

397
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,720
Let's have fun and get along with everyone.

398
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,980
You want to do it too,
don't you? Let's have fun.

399
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520


400
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,260
Let's play the king game.

401
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,700
That's a good idea.

402
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,040
I can't see it.

403
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,200
But you know what it is, right?

404
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,820
Yes.

405
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,220
I'll let you draw first.

406
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:10,980
Okay.

407
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,280
Please hide the number.

408
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,860
You can draw as you like.

409
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,580
I'll start.

410
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,080
Let's do it with one hand.

411
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:22,081
Let's do it by hand.

412
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,380
Let's do this.

413
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,020
One, two, three.

414
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,640
Who is the king? Yes, it's me.

415
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,620


416
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,260
Why?

417
01:19:41,261 --> 01:19:42,261
Why is it you?

418
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,840
Yay! I'm so happy.

419
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,260


420
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,900
What are you going to do?

421
01:19:46,901 --> 01:19:49,300
I don't know what to do.

422
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:56,440
The number one person will kiss Osawa.

423
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
Number one, number three.

424
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,760
Number two.

425
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,580
I'm glad it's number three.

426
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,160
Number one.

427
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:21,120
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss... What? No? Oh, no.

428
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,120
..

429
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:25,121
What does the king say?

430
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:26,820
Absolutely!

431
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,360
Well, you're number one.

432
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,280
So, look, you'll be okay.

433
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:39,360
How many seconds?

434
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,500
How many seconds? I'm the king.

435
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,920


436
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,100
How about 10 seconds?

437
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
10 seconds is fine.

438
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,720
What does the king
say? Absolutely.

439
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:51,780
Please.

440
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,260


441
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,970
Look at Hiroo's eyes.

442
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:05,610
Look, what does the
king say? Absolutely.

443
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:08,570


444
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:14,030
May I?

445
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:16,690
The king will kiss you.

446
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,130
How many seconds? Ten seconds.

447
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,270


448
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:32,050
Oh, I didn't count.

449
01:21:32,051 --> 01:21:32,390
It didn't come out.

450
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,890
Let's do it again.

451
01:21:35,890 --> 01:22:02,780
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 I don't know.

452
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:03,781


453
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,300
I'm a little dizzy.

454
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,440
I haven't taken a tube yet.

455
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,900
Let's do it next time.

456
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,180
Let's do it next time.

457
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,620
Yeah!

458
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,780
Who is the king?

459
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:19,781
Who is the king?

460
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,540
Yeah!

461
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,480
Yeah!

462
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,760
Yeah!

463
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,680
What should I do?

464
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,460
I'm a little nervous.

465
01:22:30,461 --> 01:22:31,461
I'm excited.

466
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,320
No.1 is...

467
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,460
No.2 is...

468
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
a Chikubiname.

469
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,880
Oh...

470
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,940
So, first of all... So,
first of all, who is No.

471
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,860
1? It's me!

472
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,320
As expected of the president.

473
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,420
Actually... No, it's not.

474
01:22:58,421 --> 01:23:01,720
So, who is the second person?

475
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:13,350
Well, let's do it like this.

476
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:17,650
Well, I'm going to be rude to you.

477
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,910
You don't like it?

478
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,010
Let's do it, everyone.

479
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,430
One, two...

480
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,530
This video is a derivative

483
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,630
Let's go.

484
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,880
What's wrong? Great.

485
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,220


486
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,320
You're doing something erotic.

487
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

488
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,180
I'll do it now.

489
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,320
10

490
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:06,340
Who is the king? It's me.

491
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,540


492
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,420
Who is it?

493
01:25:15,421 --> 01:25:27,820
The third person will be on
top of the second person's face.

494
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:36,500
First of all, the second person.

495
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:42,180
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

496
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,620
Well, then, the number
3 will be lying on the bed.

497
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,200
Number 3, huh? Well, then.

498
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000


499
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,160
You are number 3!

500
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,080
Well, then, who is number 3?

501
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,980
Oh, what's the
number? Ah, ah, ah.

502
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,860
It's 3, isn't it?

503
01:26:00,861 --> 01:26:05,540
So, I'm going to ask
you to cross your legs.

504
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,040
I can't do it. I'm embarrassed.

505
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:15,101
The king's word
is... Absolutely!

506
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,440
So, I'm going to ask
you to cross your legs.

507
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,200
Come on, Aoyama-san.

508
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,440
You are so cute.

509
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:28,220
Thank you.

510
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:29,700
Stand up.

511
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:32,420
Is it like this?

512
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:33,540
Is it OK?

513
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,220
Like this, right?

514
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:37,220
OK.

515
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,740
Stand up again.

516
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,220
It's difficult.

517
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,700
Come on! Good girl.

518
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,320
Come on.

519
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,860
It's difficult.

520
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:48,861


521
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,200
I'll support you.

522
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,000
I'll support you.

523
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,080
Is this okay?

524
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,240
Well, where are you licking?

525
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,860
I'm not licking.

526
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:04,900
I can't help it.

527
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:10,560
Do you count this,
too? Ten seconds.

528
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:33,040
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

529
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,020
You are so cute.

530
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:51,370
You are so cute.

531
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,070
King James is over.

532
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,270
It's dangerous.

533
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:07,070
Because I'm not doing anything.

534
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:13,130
You don't have enough alcohol.

535
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,170
I'll taste it.

536
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,350
Please don't.

537
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:26,790
Please don't.

538
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:51,280
I want some sake, too.

539
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,670
Here you are.

540
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,450
How does it
taste? It's delicious.

541
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:16,930


542
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,590
There's no need to be so polite.

543
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,130
This is how you do it.

544
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,110
Is this how you do it?

545
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:31,810
Yeah, like this.

546
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,930
I won't disturb you.

547
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:42,070
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

548
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:43,870
Oh, here it comes.

549
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,790
You're wearing a tea bag today.

550
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:53,510
Why are you wearing such a vulgar panties?

551
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,190
Do you want to fight?

552
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,250
Do you always wear such vulgar panties?

553
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:03,870
You have a lot of enemies.

554
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:26,350
I'm sorry.

555
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:29,550
I'll take it off.

556
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:36,770
I'm sorry.

557
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:44,870
You want to put it on?

558
01:30:44,871 --> 01:30:46,350
No.

559
01:30:46,351 --> 01:30:47,351
Thank you very much.

560
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:48,390
You too.

561
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,190
I'm going to take it off.

562
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:53,350
Wow!

563
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,030
Wow!

564
01:30:56,031 --> 01:30:58,570
When I open it again,

565
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,910
Wow!

566
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:01,650
Wow!

567
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:09,150
It's wet again,
isn't it? No, it's not.

568
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:11,310
No, it's not.

569
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:12,770


570
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:14,830
Let's have fun today.

571
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,470
Yes.

572
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:38,320
I'm glad I was able to take care of Ayumu.

573
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,700
Ayumu is a very gentle cat.

574
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,120
I'm glad I was able to take care of Ayumu.

575
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,380
I'm glad you like it.

576
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,280
You like this kind of thing, don't you?

577
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:02,100
You like this kind of thing, don't you?

578
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,280
You like this kind of thing, don't you?

579
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,720
I wanted you to put it in your friend.

580
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:07,721
It's Chico.

581
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,160
Let's have fun together.

582
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,680
I'll lick you.

583
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,460
You are so naughty.

584
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,400
Spread your legs.

585
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,150
Slowly.

586
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:07,970
Good.

587
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,860
You have a good look.

588
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:17,160
Open your eyes and show me.

589
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:19,440
No, I don't.

590
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,980
I'm embarrassed.

591
01:33:20,981 --> 01:33:26,900
It is the custom of the Chōnai-kai to
show each other embarrassing moments.

592
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,140
Let's deepen our friendship.

593
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:54,340
I can't get enough of it.

594
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,360
It would be great to drink
alcohol while looking at this manko.

595
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:02,320
I want to drink sake.

596
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:06,220
Then, let's make it Wakame sake.

597
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,240
Sounds good.

598
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:09,520
Sounds good.

599
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:10,980
Then, lie down.

600
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:18,140
Put your legs like this.

601
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,860
Who will drink Wakame sake?

602
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:25,540
Of course, it's me.

603
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,220
It can't be helped.

604
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:29,480
I'm going to give you a treat.

605
01:34:29,481 --> 01:34:30,481
Let's go.

606
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,040
Uri

607
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:38,880
Uri Ah Oh Ah

608
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,380
Ah

609
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,520
Oh

610
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,260
Oh Oh Oh Oh

611
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,420
You don't have to go.

612
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:42,980
You don't have to go.

613
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,220
You don't have to go.

614
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,880
I want to go.

615
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,120
I want to go.

616
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:03,900
Let's play together.

617
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:04,901
Let's play together.

618
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:11,960
Let's play together.

619
01:36:11,961 --> 01:36:13,040
I don't know what to do.

620
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,180
I'd like you to pet him.

621
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,470
He's young.

622
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,650
He's saying it himself.

623
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,920
I'm glad.

624
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:37,810
It's nice.

625
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,700
It feels good.

626
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:41,940
Come here.

627
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,720
Yabe-san, look at me.

628
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,820
Yabe-san, look at me.

629
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:01,740
Yabe-san, look at me.

630
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:07,660
Yabe-san, look at me.

631
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,820
I feel good.

632
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,640
I'll put you on my lap.

633
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:22,440
It's OK.

634
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,020
I'm going to sit on your lap.

635
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,100
OK, I'm going to sit on your lap.

636
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:36,210
It's good.

637
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:43,410
You look very happy.

638
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,220
Mr. Oyama.

639
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,600
There are more over here.

640
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:16,060
Mr. Oyama, you are grumbling.

641
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,420
Mr. Oyama, you are quite a M size.

642
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,380
Do you like this kind of thing?

643
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:28,140
Oh, great!

644
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,620
The skin got dirty.

645
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:35,620
Wow, great!

646
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,320
The mouth is also nice.

647
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,380
It feels good, doesn't it?

648
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:54,160
Ah, I got it, Dr. Hamayama.

649
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,500
Please let me stick it in, Dr. Hamayama.

650
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,356
He cannot do anything but move his mouth.

651
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:01,380
Come on!

652
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,880
Yes, a little bit.

653
01:39:03,881 --> 01:39:16,180
It's okay, it's okay.

654
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:24,460
I'm going to sleep.

655
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,280
I have a master.

656
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,240
Of course, I'll keep it a
secret from my master.

657
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,720
Well, well, well.

658
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,400
You haven't had enough
sake yet, have you? That's right.

659
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,760


660
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,460
Do you want me to give you a drink?

661
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:26,830
Thanks for watching this video.

662
01:40:26,831 --> 01:40:28,551
Please feel free to ask questions yourself.

663
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,100
I'll try to answer as many as possible.

664
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:49,610
Please enjoy this video.

665
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:52,690
You're getting more and
more erotic, aren't you?

666
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:55,610
What's wrong with you?

667
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:00,610
I can't do it anymore.

668
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,950
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

669
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:06,070
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

670
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:06,550
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

671
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:08,610
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

672
01:41:08,611 --> 01:41:08,710
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

673
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:10,186
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

674
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:12,166
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

675
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:14,150
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

676
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,546
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

677
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:19,230
I've been telling you
for a long time, haven't I?

678
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:20,650
I can't help it.

679
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:22,310
Do you want to change it?

680
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:27,450
What are you going to do?

681
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:28,450
Is it okay?

682
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:30,050
For the time being, once with this.

683
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:36,230
Oh, it's in.

684
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:39,110
I've always wanted to do this.

685
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:42,270
Look.

686
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:42,590
Look.

687
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:44,710
His nipples are sticking out.

688
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:46,630
His nipples are flat.

689
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:47,690
It's good, isn't it?

690
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:49,990
Ayumu-san, look.

691
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:51,350
Raise your elbow.

692
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:53,390
Get up a little.

693
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:55,890
Yes, yes.

694
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:56,910
Raise your elbow.

695
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,090
It's connected.

696
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:01,450
Look.

697
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:02,950
You can see it well.

698
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:04,970
Look.

699
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,530
Good.

700
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,990
You can't do that.

701
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:12,890
Look.

702
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,670
It's in there, isn't it?

703
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:16,210
How is it?

704
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:18,850
You seem to be getting along well.

705
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:27,590
It's not so cold.

706
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:30,350
I can't hear you.

707
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:32,550
It's cold.

708
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:43,790
Oh, it's tight.

709
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:49,670
You can't forget me.

710
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:07,020
The baby who was having a hard time
with the floor is now becoming a mother.

711
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:33,820
The baby is now 10 years old.

712
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,980
I have a futon for you.

713
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,840
Let's use the futon.

714
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:11,640
Come here.

715
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,700
Come here.

716
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:21,540
Come here.

717
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:31,740
Are you okay?

718
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:32,741
I'm going to take a bath.

719
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,140
Are you ready?

720
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,810
You have a good face.

721
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:58,210
You look good in anything.

722
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:28,110
I'm going to take a bath.

723
01:45:28,111 --> 01:45:29,351
I'm going to change my clothes.

724
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:37,930
Can I sit on your lap?

725
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:04,450
Your back is moving a lot.

726
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:08,630
Ayano, are you getting
serious? It feels good.

727
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:12,650


728
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:17,630
How do you feel?

729
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:27,730
It's the first time I've
been with so many people.

730
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:32,770
I'm going to go crazy.

731
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:36,930
You don't have to go crazy.

732
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:40,530
You're going to go crazy when you're born.

733
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,430
Your cheeks are blue.

734
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,590
You have a nasty waist.

735
01:46:58,591 --> 01:46:59,591
You are so quiet.

736
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,940
You feel so good.

737
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,130
You are so good.

738
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:52,390
Are you thirsty? Look.

739
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,380


740
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:50,060
We'd like you to measure the number of toes
in the hand while sitting or standing up.

741
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:53,821
urinating We'd like to measure the number
of toes in the hand while standing up.

742
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,160
I'm going to give him a sedative.

743
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:32,300
I'm going to give him a sedative.

744
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:52,200
Once in a while, I give him a sedative.

745
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,560
I'm going to give him a sedative.

746
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:19,460
I'm not upset anymore.

747
01:50:19,461 --> 01:50:24,480
I'm not angry anymore.

748
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,120
I'm not mad anymore.

749
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:34,560
I'm not angry anymore.

750
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,200
I'm not angry anymore.

751
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,620
I'm sorry.

752
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:45,420
May I look at your belly?

753
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:52,920
You have a lot of belly fat.

754
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:14,940
I can't take it anymore.

755
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:29,430
It's too strong.

756
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:39,070
I'm going crazy.

757
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:50,410
I will put the video link
on the description section.

758
01:53:50,430 --> 01:54:23,020
I will put the video link
on the description section.

759
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:27,760
Please enjoy the video.

760
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:02,060
Oh, it's so gross.

761
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,160
Oh, it's so painful.

762
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:18,860
Oh, if you hit me so hard...

763
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:22,450
I'm going to kill you.

764
01:56:07,190 --> 01:57:40,040
This is how I became a butterfly.

765
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:44,400
I have become a comforter for
the old men in the neighborhood.

766
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:54,580
Every time I go around the neighborhood,
I am used to the cleanliness of the staff.

767
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:05,000
But in fact, I am secretly enjoying it.

768
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,200
Thank you for watching!
