It's easy to be eroic.

334
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,590
I love it.

335

Yes.

456
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,580

479
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,860
I can't stand it anymore.

480
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,050
It's not cold, so it's okay.

481
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,620

What's that?

485
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,220
That fast?

486
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,260
Oh my god.

487
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:07,320
I can't do it anymore

488
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,760

You can do it, you can do it!

678
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:41,260
You can do it!

679
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:45,180
I'm going to get you!

680
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:55,320
I'm going to get you!

681
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:04,480
Ah, ah, ah.

682
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,230
Ah, ah.

683
01:30:14,231 --> 01:30:15,231
The bell is ringing.

684
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:16,570
That's right.

685
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,770
Ah, ah.

686
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,150
Ah, ah.

687
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:43,880
Well, let's have a toast.

688
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,380
Yes, cheers.

689
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,790
Yes.

690
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:59,220
Yes.

691
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,120
Is it good?

692
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,200
Is it good?

693
01:31:04,455 --> 01:31:05,460
Yes, it is.

694
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,780
Is it good?

695
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:08,220
Yes, it is.

696
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,600
From the director again.

697
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:20,410
I see.

698
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:45,120
Do you know?

699
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:46,540
I know.

700
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,480
I'm scared.

701
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,140
It's time to do it.

702
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:06,580
You can use this to attack Elena.

703
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,160
Attack?

704
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,600
Which one do you want to start with?

705
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,300
Which one?

706
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,401
Do you want to start with this?

707
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,121
Do you know? Have you ever used it?

708
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:24,620
Yes, I know.

709
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,720
I've used it before.

710
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:28,860
You've used it before?

711
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
What?

712
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,500
But I don't have it.

713
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:34,560
Have you ever done it?

714
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,960
Yes.

715
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:36,460

716
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:37,660
I don't have it.

717
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I don't have it.

718
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,160
I see.

719
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,240
Let's start from here.

720
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:46,860
Let's go over there.

721
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,640
This way.

722
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:57,170
Since we are here,

723
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,910
look at the mirror and stand up.

724
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:07,050
Ecchi Ecchi.

725
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:09,910
You are Ecchi.

726
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:40,640
Yes yes yes.

727
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,920
Let's try this

728
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,340
Like this.

729
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:47,100
Oh.

730
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,430
You can see it.

731
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,490
Hehehe.

732
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:45,841
This is amazing Good girl.

733
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,220
You can say a lot.

734
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:41,373
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

735
01:37:41,385 --> 01:37:57,460

Aaaa... Zzz... I
can't take it anymore.

743
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,420
I can't take it anymore.

744
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:47,690
Take a deep breath.

745
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:14,610
Urgh!

746
01:44:44,000 --> 01:45:09,800

Okay, okay, okay.

754
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,990
You can go a lot
Like you did before.

755
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:33,250
I can't do it anymore.

756
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:38,070
I can't do it anymore.

757
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:20,940
How do you feel?

01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,520
It's hard but I feel good.

763
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,130
The director is calling you again.

764
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,680
I have a message for you.

765
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:46,570
Wait a minute.

766
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:47,590
I see.

767
01:51:57,930 --> 01:52:04,140
You should use an eye
mask and do something erotic.

768
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,600
OK.

769
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:11,360

Can you do it by yourself?

774
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:16,940
Yes.

775
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,240

01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:13,440
You are very wet.

783
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:24,610
Do you get excited when you can't see?

784
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:26,370

785
01:59:28,110 --> 01:59:29,150
You're so wet.

786
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:34,230
I want to go home.

787
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:50,420
I can't believe I'm doing this to myself.

788
02:02:50,421 --> 02:02:51,516
I can't believe I'm doing this to myself.

789
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:40,763
