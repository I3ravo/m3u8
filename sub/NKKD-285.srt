1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is the first time I've ever done this, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it will turn out.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm looking forward to seeing how it will turn out.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm looking forward to seeing how it will turn out.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm looking forward to seeing how it will turn out.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,080
...

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,840
You.

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,300
Have some coffee?

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,880
No!

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,780
I'm okay.

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,580
Yes, yes.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,380
This weekend is weekend,

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,100
what about shifts?

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,620
hollow-out work.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This week?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
See?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The new garden.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We promised to go by car.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, that's right.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It was this week.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, I think it's okay.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Really?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It depends on the progress of the company's project.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Maybe I'll have to work overtime again.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,700
I see.

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,200
But don't worry too much.

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,200
You've been working all the time lately.

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,000
It's because I got fired from Tokyo and got a job at the management office.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,700
If I don't contribute to the company's business, I won't look good.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, it's hard for you, isn't it?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's okay, it's okay.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's still room for discussion in the apartment.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll do my best today as well.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Huh?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, it's already this time.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then, I'll go to the office.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
See you later.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Did you forget something?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, it's okay.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The next day

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please come in.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Have a good night.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, I'm home.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Welcome home.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is Kanae.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is Iguchi-senbu.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello, I'm Iguchi.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is Yamashita from Doki.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm Yamashita. Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Senbu, your wife is really nice, isn't she?

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
She's got a great body.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
More than that, I'm going to that club.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're going to the hotel?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please come in.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This way.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please come in.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Here, sit down.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is for you.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry for the trouble, but I'm really sorry.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, Yamashita, drink it.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, it's for you.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is for Kyoshiku.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, you're my friend. Please forgive me.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, it's not like that.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's good. This time, I'll give it to the new head of the Amakawa branch.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a great mansion.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is this the office?

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've been working as a loaner for 35 years.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, I see. But it's a management job starting next year.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If I were the head of the department, I would have worked hard and returned it as soon as possible.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's true.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No, no, no.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No, I really want to return it.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can't believe I'm going to be a manager soon.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Thank you for waiting. Here's your snack.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Oh, thank you.

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,700
Kimu, sit down here.

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Oh, okay.

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,200
Sit down, sit down.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,900
You have to sit down here.

93
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,300
Oh, thank you.

94
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh, thank you.

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
Here's your snack.

96
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,500
Thank you.

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,700
You're welcome.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm so glad to be invited by such a beautiful lady.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
By the way, the vice president's group is doing something suspicious.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They are really bad guys.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, we have to be careful not to cause trouble.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If we like, we'll try to make the people of the executive branch lose their jobs.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We'll start a scandal.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, Amakawa-kun, you're going to lose your job from next term.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We have to be careful not to cause trouble.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, executive.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What do you think of Ms. Amakawa?

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, I don't know.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She's the best in the class.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Right, Ms. Amakawa?

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you very much.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But Ms. Amakawa is really beautiful.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're right, Senmu.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're so beautiful.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You have a good style.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you do anything like modeling?

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No, I didn't do anything like that.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
By the way,

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
when I was a student,

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I went to Miss Campus.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, I think I got second place.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow, that's amazing.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You got second place in Miss Can?

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I wonder if that's true.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't believe it.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't remember anything about the past.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm so jealous of the beautiful wife of Mr. Harukawa.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You should get married too, Yamashita.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're single, aren't you?

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes, I am.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I envy you.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll get married soon.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is that so?

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Anyway, Hamakawa-kun,

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,180
With a beautiful wife and a nice apartment.

138
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,960
Anyway, I hope you will continue to do your best as our manager.

139
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,880
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
Well, let's toast.

141
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Well, let's toast.

142
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,900
Well, let's toast again.

143
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,280
Cheers.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Thank you for the food.

145
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,320
Wow, it's so nice.

146
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,920
It's amazing that you can make such a wonderful dish even though it's so beautiful.

147
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I just used what I had.

148
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,420
You really don't have a place to go during the day, do you?

149
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,420
No, I don't.

150
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,720
As expected, you are the most successful wife of the year.

151
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,920
Please stop, Director.

152
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
I don't want to. It's embarrassing.

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Here is your sake.

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Thank you.

155
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Your cooking is very good.

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm glad that you like it.

157
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
It's the best.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Every time I cook such a delicious dish, the food is delicious.

159
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I'm going to go to the bathroom for a while

160
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Please come in.

161
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Please come in.

162
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Please come in.

163
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Thank you.

164
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
No problem.

166
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
What kind of request do you have today?

167
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Where are you from?

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Actually, I'd like to talk to you about your husband, Mr. Amakawa.

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,320
About my husband?

170
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:48,320
As a new manager, he's still working hard at the company.

171
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,820
In fact, our company also has what is called a school punishment, which is like a fight for the school punishment.

172
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:01,320
The people of the opposite class are playing a lot of tricks.

173
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,320
So, to make Mr. Amakawa, who has just been promoted to the management office, lose his job,

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,320
I've been pointing out the drawbacks of last year's project.

175
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
If things go on like this, Master,

176
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I don't know if I'll be able to get a promotion,

177
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
or if I'll be able to get rid of some kind of bribes.

178
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Um, um...

179
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Can't you do something about it?

180
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Master...

181
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,320
He's busy with work every day.

182
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
He said he wanted to get a job as a manager.

183
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,320
He said he'll do his best because he has a lot to do at home.

184
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Can't we do something about it, teacher?

185
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
Even the loan at home...

186
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,320
We can do something about it with the bonus.

187
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,920
We're really working hard together right now.

188
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,120
But...

189
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,920
Um...

190
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
It's like this.

191
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,720
Please.

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,020
Well...

193
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,920
We can't do anything about it, can we?

194
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,820
Really?

195
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,720
Yeah.

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,320
If I don't do the opposite, I'll be at a risk.

197
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Well, I'm at a risk, so I can't just say it.

198
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
What should I do?

199
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Um, Sam, this is...

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Well, if you leave me to it, I'll take good care of you.

201
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
But...

202
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
There's a risk, but there's also a risk.

203
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I trusted you as the head of the department, but I failed.

204
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I'm sorry, but my husband will scold me.

205
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,320
You still have a loan, don't you?

206
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Your husband is silent, so I don't know.

207
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm sorry, but please don't do this.

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:47,320
I don't know if my husband can stay as the head of the department or not.

209
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,320
You understand, don't you?

210
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm in trouble.

211
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,320
If you can't pay the loan, you'll be in more trouble.

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
That's...

213
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Which one do you think is in trouble?

214
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
But...

215
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,320
You have a really good body, don't you?

216
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Please stop. I can't see you.

217
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Please stop, Mr. Eguchi.

218
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm in trouble.

219
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Where are you going, madam?

220
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm really in trouble.

221
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I don't want to do it. I'm going to be scolded by my boss.

222
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,320
If you don't pay the rent, you might have to leave this apartment.

223
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
That's...

224
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
And this and that...

225
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I've been curious about your body for a long time.

226
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Please stop.

227
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:08,320
If you let me touch your body, I'll wipe away the work of the other party.

228
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
It's not a bad thing, isn't it?

229
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
What if my husband finds out about this?

230
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I don't know.

231
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
If you leave it to me, it will be over soon.

232
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
What do you think?

233
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
For me...

234
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm in trouble...

235
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
As the wife of the chief...

236
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
You have to support your husband.

237
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
This is...

238
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
As expected...

239
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Please stop.

240
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,320
If you leave it to me, I'll do something about my husband.

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm sorry

242
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
It's not over yet.

243
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Please stop.

244
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,320
You can't just swallow it.

245
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
It's really good, isn't it?

246
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Are you sensitive here?

247
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
No, I'm not!

248
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320
You're saying you're not, but you're reacting, aren't you?

249
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Right?

250
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Or...

251
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Is there a more sensitive place?

252
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
No, please don't do that!

253
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
There is, isn't there?

254
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
There is...

255
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Please don't do this to me.

256
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:21,320
If you leave it to me, I'll keep working at the company.

257
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
What is it?

258
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
I don't like it.

259
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Show me your beautiful butt.

260
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,320
It's really covered.

261
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Stop.

262
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,320
If your husband's future is promised, it's a good deal, isn't it?

263
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Don't you think so?

264
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
My husband's future...

265
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,320
I didn't know that.

266
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Don't say that.

267
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,320
It's getting tighter here.

268
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,320
I can feel it.

269
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I can feel it.

270
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Is it here?

271
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Please don't do that.

272
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,320
I don't want to.

273
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Please forgive me.

275
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
You're getting wet.

276
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
It's okay.

277
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
You'll feel better.

278
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Stop it.

279
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Please don't do that.

280
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Did you say something?

281
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Please don't do that.

282
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
It's that easy, isn't it?

283
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
No, no, no.

284
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Please let me go.

285
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
No, no.

286
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I'm sorry, I'm not a skipper.

287
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
That's not true!

288
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
It's okay, it doesn't hurt.

289
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,320
It's getting worse and worse.

290
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Please stop it.

291
00:22:33,320 --> 00:23:03,320
No, no

292
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm sorry.

293
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
You're really going too far, aren't you?

294
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
No.

295
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Right?

296
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Just now...

297
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Um...

298
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
My husband...

299
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
No...

300
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Stop it.

302
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
No, no, no.

303
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
You're full of energy, aren't you?

304
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
You're not going to run away, are you?

305
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Mr. Izuchi, Mr. Izuchi...

306
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Oh no!

307
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Please don't!

308
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
What?

309
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
What are you doing?

310
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,320
No, you can't get mad at me like this, can you?

311
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,340
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

312
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,360
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

313
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,420
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

314
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,480
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

315
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:58,540
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

316
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:58,600
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

317
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:58,660
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

318
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:58,720
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

319
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:58,800
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

320
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:58,880
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

321
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:58,960
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

322
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,020
No, I can't get mad at you like this, can you?

323
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,020
I'll cover it up.

324
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Let's do something more pleasant.

325
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
I'll cover it up.

326
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Please stop.

327
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
Please stop.

328
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
I can't.

329
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
I can't do it.

330
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Is it okay?

331
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
No.

332
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
No matter what happens to my husband.

333
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Stop.

334
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
No!

335
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Go! No!

336
00:25:35,020 --> 00:26:05,020
I'm sorry

337
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Me too.

338
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,020
Well then, see you later.

339
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,020
You don't have to do this anymore.

340
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:15,020
If you leave it to me, I'll do something about my husband.

341
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Isn't it cheap if your husband's future is promised with this?

342
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:31,020
Don't you think so?

343
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:43,020
If you leave it to me, I will continue to work in the company from now on.

344
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:31,020
I'm sorry

345
00:28:31,020 --> 00:29:01,020
I'm sorry

346
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
I'm home!

347
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Welcome home!

348
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
You took a bath?

349
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Yes, I'm sweating.

350
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
I'll get you some food.

351
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Thank you.

352
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
By the way,

353
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
about my project,

354
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
I'm having a hard time.

355
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
I'm sorry.

356
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I had a hard time.

361
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
It was Saturday, right?

362
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
Yes.

363
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,020
I wanted to go to a gardening shop.

364
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020
Yes.

365
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,020
It may be a little strict.

366
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Is that so?

367
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,020
I understand.

368
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
Anyway,

370
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I'm working hard as a manager now.

371
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,700
For the sake of our future,

372
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,980
we have no choice but to do our best now.

373
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,900
I understand. I'll do my best, too.

374
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,380
What's for dinner tonight?

375
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,180
I don't know.

376
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,220
Do you have any requests?

377
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,500
I see.

378
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,420
How about hamburgers?

379
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I'll go get them.

380
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:57,020
I'm sorry

381
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,020
I'm sorry

382
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
I'm sorry.

383
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,020
As expected of your wife.

384
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
It's a wise decision.

385
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:58,020
I thought you would understand because you are smart.

387
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Please keep it a secret from your husband.

388
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Of course.

389
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:49,020
I don't know why, but I'm not sure if it's because I don't know how to do it

390
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Please wait for me.

391
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Of course I will.

392
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,020
You don't have to worry about your husband.

393
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:27,020
Your husband is working hard at the company right now, so you should do your best, too.

394
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,020
Hold him tight.

395
00:33:49,020 --> 00:34:19,020
Oh, oh

396
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
I can't believe I'm doing this.

397
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,020
I'm so happy.

398
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,020
I'm so happy.

399
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,020
I'm so happy.

400
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
I'm so happy.

401
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
I'm so happy.

402
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
I'm so happy.

403
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,020
I'm so happy.

404
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,020
I'm so happy.

405
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,020
I'm so happy.

406
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
I'm so happy.

407
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,020
I'm so happy.

408
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm so happy.

409
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
I'm so happy.

410
00:34:47,020 --> 00:35:06,020
I'm so jealous that you have such a good style and a wife who is easy to feel.

411
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,900
Ah, ah, ah

412
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,400
Slurping

413
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,280
Hmm?

414
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,520
Stomachs areVAgGn

415
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,840
Ah no

416
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,900
onsidering

417
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,580
Ah, don't play with me

418
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,240
Wait..

419
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,760
Stop

420
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,320
Stop it

421
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
I'm sorry.

422
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,320
You're in love, aren't you?

423
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Stop it, stop it.

424
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Why are you crying?

425
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm so hungry.

426
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm so hungry.

427
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,320
I can't do it anymore.

428
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I can't do it anymore.

429
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:39,320
No, no

430
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Are you okay?

431
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm not done yet.

432
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
I'm almost done.

433
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Stop it.

434
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Forgive me.

435
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Ah...

436
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Ah...

437
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Ah...

438
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Ah...

439
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
It's all over the place.

440
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
No, it's not.

441
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,080
It's...

442
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
Ah...

443
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
No...

444
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Ah...

445
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
I'm so sorry.

446
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
I'm so sorry.

447
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
I'm so sorry.

448
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm so sorry.

449
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm so sorry.

450
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
I'm so sorry.

451
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,320
I'm so sorry.

452
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
I'm so sorry.

453
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
I'm so sorry.

454
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm so sorry.

455
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
I'm so sorry.

456
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
I'm so sorry.

457
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm so sorry.

458
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm so sorry.

459
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:45,320
It's time to make you feel better.

460
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
What is it?

461
00:39:51,320 --> 00:40:21,320
I'm sorry

462
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Yes.

463
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Do you smell good?

464
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Yes.

465
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
You've been through so much.

466
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Please take care of me.

467
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Please take care of me.

468
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:34,320
I wonder if the owner is really okay.

469
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Isn't it natural?

470
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,320
How is the taste of Chimpanzee other than your husband?

471
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
That's right.

472
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
That's right.

473
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
That's right.

474
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
That's right.

475
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
That's right.

476
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
That's right.

477
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
That's right.

478
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
That's right.

479
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
That's right.

480
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
That's right.

481
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
That's right.

482
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
That's right.

483
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
That's right.

484
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
That's right.

485
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
That's right.

486
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
That's right.

487
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
That's right.

488
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
That's right.

489
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
That's right.

490
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Please lie down.

491
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Here we go, madam.

492
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Ah!

493
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
As expected of your wife.

494
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,320
With this, you can be sure of your husband's identity.

495
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Please, please, don't leave me.

496
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I can't do it anymore.

497
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,320
I can't do it anymore.

498
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
No!

499
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
No!

500
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
No!

501
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
No, I can't.

502
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
Please wait.

503
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I can't do this anymore.

504
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
I can't go.

505
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
You're full of wounds.

506
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,320
No, I can't go.

507
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I can't do it anymore.

508
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Please wait.

509
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
I just said it.

510
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Please wait.

511
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm sorry.

512
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
I just said it.

513
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Mom, I can't do it anymore.

514
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
I can't do it anymore.

515
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
I can't do it anymore.

516
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,320
How do you feel?

517
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,320
How do you feel?

518
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
How do you feel?

519
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Compared to your husband

520
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Do you feel better?

521
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Hey, what do you think?

522
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
Be honest with me.

523
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:18,320
If you behave like that, I'll cut your hair.

524
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
See?

525
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,320
It's a big one.

526
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,320
It's my husband's.

527
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
It's dangerous.

528
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:25,320
No, no

529
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
What should I do?

530
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:25,320
No, no

531
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,320
I can't die.

532
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Oh, no, no

533
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,320
I can't do it anymore.

534
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,320
I can't do it anymore.

535
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I can't do it anymore.

536
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,320
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,320
I can't do it anymore.

538
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I can't do it anymore.

539
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,320
I can't do it anymore.

540
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
I can't do it anymore.

541
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,320
No, no, no.

542
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,320
Go, go, go.

543
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
Please stop.

544
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Please stop.

545
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
I'm going!

546
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
I'm going!

547
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
I'm going to cry.

548
00:50:38,320 --> 00:51:08,320
I'm sorry

549
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,320
Are you happy?

550
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Please leave it to me.

551
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:23,320
Before that, your wife is going to go to work.

552
00:52:38,320 --> 00:53:08,320
Mom

553
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
I'm sorry.

554
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,320
Congratulations.

555
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
I'm sorry.

556
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
I think it's time for you to go to the shop.

557
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Please.

558
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,320
No, I can't go there.

559
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,320
I'm going.

560
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

561
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,240
I'm sorry!

562
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,340
Would you like to take a shower?

563
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,900
Actually I have a meeting after this.

564
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,080
Mr. Shinji...

565
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,080
It's the pleasure to meet you.

566
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,380
Well now...

567
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,320
Feel your armsScraping

568
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:45,320
Hey, Amaka-kun, your husband is working hard at the company.

569
00:55:53,320 --> 00:56:03,320
Now that I'm on your side, your husband is safe in the future.

570
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:13,320
You don't have to worry about anything.

571
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
Thank you very much.

572
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,320
Senma, how long are you going to stay here?

573
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:31,320
It's good to have a bath in the middle of the night.

574
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,320
It's comfortable.

575
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:40,320
I'm not used to bathing in the middle of the night.

576
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,320
I don't want to.

577
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,320
There's nothing to do.

578
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,320
You're doing your best, Ran-chan.

579
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,320
But when I come back...

580
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,320
Why don't you come back?

581
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,320
Ran-chan, you're standing up again.

582
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,320
But...

583
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm sorry

584
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,320
You can't forget the chimp from before, can you?

585
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,320
What's wrong? You went too far a while ago.

586
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,320
Are you okay now?

587
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,320
Stop it, please stop it.

588
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Did you feel lucky to have a chimp from before?

589
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,320
I want to take a bath.

590
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,320
You want to take a bath, don't you?

591
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
I want to take a bath.

592
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Please don't do this to me.

593
00:58:52,320 --> 00:59:22,320
It's been a long time since the last time I saw it

594
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,320
You're so mean!

595
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,320
You rubbed me like that for the first time in my life!

596
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,320
You just ate all the food with this chimp, didn't you?

597
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,320
No, I didn't.

598
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,320
I'm sorry.

599
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,320
Do you do this with your husband in the bathroom?

600
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,320
What are you going to do if I ask you?

601
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,320
You're a good girl.

602
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,320
I've never done anything like that.

603
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,320
I see.

604
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,320
So you're not going to do this for me?

605
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
You're rude.

606
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:01,320
You can't be satisfied with just a little bit of it, can you?

607
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
Right?

608
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,320
I can't be satisfied with just a little bit of it, can you?

609
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:17,320
Are you satisfied with just a little bit of sex?

610
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,320
To be honest, I do love you.

611
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,320
I'm not asking if you love me or not.

612
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,320
I'm asking if you're satisfied with me.

613
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
It's not enough, is it?

614
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,320
I feel good.

615
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:47,320
I'm sorry

616
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,320
I'm going to take care of you for the rest of your life, so please take good care of me.

617
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,320
I'm going to take care of you for the rest of your life, so please take good care of me.

618
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,320
I'm going to take care of you for the rest of your life, so please take good care of me.

619
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,320
I'm going to take care of you for the rest of your life, so please take good care of me.

620
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,320
I'm going to take care of you for the rest of your life, so please take good care of me.

621
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:42,320
Oh, oh

622
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
Oh, it's hot.

623
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,320
Oh, it's hot.

624
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,320
Oh, it's hot.

625
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,320
Oh, it's hot.

626
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
Oh, it's hot.

627
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,320
Oh, it's hot.

628
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,320
Oh, it's hot.

629
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
Oh, it's hot.

630
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,320
Oh, it's hot.

631
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
Oh, it's hot.

632
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
Oh, it's hot.

633
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
Oh, it's hot.

634
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
Oh, it's hot.

635
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

636
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,320
You're so good

637
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,320
Madam

638
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,320
You're so good

639
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,320
Oh no, oh no

640
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,320
It's so hot

641
01:05:40,320 --> 01:06:10,320
I don't know what to do with my body, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about my body

642
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

643
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

644
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

645
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

646
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

647
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

648
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

649
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

650
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

651
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

652
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

653
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

654
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
I'm going to eat the rest of it.

655
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,320
Then I'll go to the office.

656
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,320
Oh, you're early in the morning again today.

657
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,320
It's been a week, isn't it?

658
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,320
It's okay, it's okay.

659
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,320
I've been told a lot of things like my brain and my normal days.

660
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Don't overdo it.

661
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:37,320
But recently, I'm really happy to work with you.

662
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,320
I wonder what happened.

663
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:47,320
Well, it's easy for me to work, so it's okay.

664
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,320
Well, I'm going.

665
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,320
Yeah.

666
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,320
Welcome.

667
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,320
Thank you for your hard work.

668
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,320
I'm Amakawa.

669
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,320
I'm sorry for being so busy.

670
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,320
Actually,

671
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,320
regarding this project,

672
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,320
I'd like to ask you

673
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,320
for your opinion.

674
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,320
That's right.

675
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,320
Also,

676
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,320
I'd like to ask you

677
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,320
for your opinion

678
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:01,320
I'd like to talk to you about the negotiation with the vanguard and the subcontractor.

679
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
Yes.

680
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,320
Yes, that's right.

681
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,320
I'm sorry.

682
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,320
Oh, and about the order form.

683
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,320
Oh, Hamakawa-kun.

684
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,320
How is it?

685
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
Well, thank you in advance.

686
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:30,320
You're the boss, so you have to do your best from now on.

687
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,320
I'm counting on you.

688
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:42,320
From now on, the company's main members are all up to you.

689
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,320
Right?

690
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,320
I'm counting on you.

691
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,320
Well then,

692
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:27,320
make sure to give me the documents by next week.

693
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,320
Yeah.

694
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,320
Yeah.

695
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,420
Even if I can't win, please do your best.

696
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:40,920
Right

697
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:44,980
Yes.

698
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,320
Yes, yes, of course.

699
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,360
Rock!

700
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Ah...

701
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
Well, I'm counting on you from now on.

702
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,320
Oh!

703
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,320
It doesn't matter.

704
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,320
Amakawa-kun, I'm counting on you.

705
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:45,320
I told you earlier, but the company is entrusted to you.

706
01:11:45,320 --> 01:12:15,320
I'm sorry,

707
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,320
I'm going to make your beautiful wife sad.

708
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,320
I'm begging you.

709
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
Let's go.

710
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,320
Do your best.

711
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,320
It's like your husband is doing his best.

712
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,320
You have to do your best too.

713
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:25,320
Yamashita-kun, I'm glad you're a professional.

714
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:33,320
I'll always be with you from now on.

715
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:40,320
It's great that you're so beautiful.

716
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,320
I didn't think you were this good.

717
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:48,320
You look so clean.

718
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,320
I really like you.

719
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,320
Say something.

720
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,320
Hmm?

721
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,320
Hmm?

722
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,320
Hmm?

723
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,320
Hmm?

724
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,320
Hmm?

725
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,320
Hmm?

726
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,320
Hmm?

727
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,320
Hmm?

728
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,320
Hmm?

729
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,320
Hmm?

730
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,320
Hmm?

731
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,320
Hmm?

732
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,320
Hmm?

733
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,320
Hmm?

734
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,320
Hmm?

735
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,320
Hmm?

736
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,320
Hmm?

737
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,320
Hmm?

738
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,320
Hmm?

739
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,320
Hmm?

740
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,320
Hmm?

741
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,320
Hmm?

742
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,320
Hmm?

743
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,320
I love you so much.

744
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,320
Don't worry.

745
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,320
Yamashita-kun.

746
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,320
You're so skinny.

747
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,320
You're amazing.

748
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,320
How is it?

749
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,320
It's beautiful.

750
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,320
Do you want to know what's going on down there?

751
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,320
Yes, I do.

752
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,320
Let me help you.

753
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
This body is beautiful.

754
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,320
Wow, it's so beautiful.

755
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,320
Is it heavy?

756
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,320
Wow.

757
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
It's a beautiful combination.

758
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,320
I wonder if it's okay if I pinch it with this.

759
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,320
It's good.

760
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,320
I'm scared.

761
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
Hold her.

762
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,320
I'm scared.

763
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,320
Widen your wings.

764
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,320
That's right.

765
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,320
You can do anything.

766
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:11,320
I love you, Chimpanzee.

767
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,320
I love you, too.

768
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:20,320
Don't cry.

769
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,320
I'm going to keep it to myself.

770
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,320
I told you the truth.

771
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,320
You won't find out.

772
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,320
Great.

773
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
Look at this side.

774
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
It's a body.

775
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,320
Look at this side.

776
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,320
Touch it.

777
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
Make it feel good.

778
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
You're the best.

779
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:21,320
You can do such a cruel thing, can't you?

780
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:25,320
No, it's for my husband.

781
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,320
For your husband?

782
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,820
Are you sure?

783
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:38,320
You're probably excited to hear that.

784
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,320
What?

785
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
Hey.

786
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,820
Are you okay?

787
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:00,800
I'm sleepy.

788
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,800
What?

789
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,800
You want to get wet again?

790
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,800
No, I don't want to.

791
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:09,800
Why?

792
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,800
Um.

793
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:21,800
I'm sleepy.

794
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,800
Hey.

795
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:23,800
What?

796
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,800
You're probably wet.

797
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,800
It hurts.

798
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,800
Say something.

799
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,800
Please.

800
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,800
I'm sorry.

801
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,800
You're happy that you got two of them.

802
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
What do you think?

803
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
Please answer.

804
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,800
I'm sorry.

805
01:19:31,800 --> 01:20:01,800
I'm sorry

806
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:31,800
No, no

807
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,800
You know what to do.

808
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,800
Hurry up.

809
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
You can go now.

810
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,800
Hurry up.

811
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
Go on.

812
01:21:31,800 --> 01:22:01,800
I'm sorry

813
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,800
Let's get out of here.

814
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,800
Let's get out of here.

815
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,800

01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,800
Let's get out of here.

819
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,800
Let's get out of here.

820
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,800
Let's get out of here.

821
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
Let's get out of here.

822
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,800
Let's get out of here.

823
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
Let's get out of here.

824
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,800
Let's get out of here.

825
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
Let's get out of here.

826
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,800
Put it in your mouth.

827
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
Oh, no.

828
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:29,800
Ah ah

829
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,800
Thank you so much.

849
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,800
Yeah, it was really good.

850
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,800
I'm going to give you a lot of good things from now on.

851
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,800
That's right.

852
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
Be sure to follow me.

853
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
Thank you very much.

854
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,800
Let's drink.

855
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
Thank you.

856
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,800
I'm sorry.

857
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
Please drink.

858
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,800
Please be with me.

859
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
Thank you.

860
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
I'm sorry.

861
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
I'm sorry that you came.

862
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,800
Thank you for waiting.

863
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,800
Thank you.

864
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
Thank you very much.

865
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Thank you.

866
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,800
Well, I'm so relieved this time.

867
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Thanks to you, I was able to do this project.

868
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,800
You really did a great job, Maka.

869
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,800
It's true. It's a difficult case, but it's great.

870
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:10,800
Well, well, well, well, this is all thanks to all of you who supported me.

871
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,800
Well, well, well, you don't have to say that.

872
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,800
Well, I'll just have a drink.

873
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,800
Please drink.

874
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,800
Thank you.

875
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,800
It's really delicious.

876
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,800
Tonight as well.

877
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
It's true.

878
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,800
The taste of your wife.

879
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,800
No, it's not like that.

880
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,800
Hamakawa-kun, you should be thankful for your wife's kindness.

881
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,800
Yes, sir.

882
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,800
I'll do my best.

883
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,800
Let's drink.

884
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,800
Let's drink.

885
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
Thank you for the food.

886
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,300
The sake is delicious.

887
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,300
It's the best.

888
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,300
Let's drink more.

889
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,300
It's because your wife supported you in the shadows.

890
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,300
Right, wife?

891
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,800
Hooray!

892
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,620
Swallow all of them!

893
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,800
The first 불�!

894
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,600
The first!

895
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,240
Better, hey?

896
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:37,840
Don't expect much

897
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,780
This is a departmental question

898
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,260
It's all thanks to you guys

899
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,500
Oh, another one

900
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,840
The first...

901
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,340
The first...!

902
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:50,800
I'm sorry

903
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
I'm sorry.

904
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
The doctor will wake up.

905
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,800
I'm sorry.

906
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,800
I'm sorry.

907
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,800
I'm sorry.

908
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
I'm sorry.

909
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,800
I'm sorry.

910
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,800
If you do it here, your voice will come out, right?

911
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,800
You wanted to do something like this, right?

912
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,800
OK, now...

913
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
Lower, lower.

914
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,800
You really want it, don't you?

915
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,800
Everyone knows that you like it.

916
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:54,800
You're just pretending to be serious in front of your husband, aren't you?

917
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,800
You want to touch it, don't you?

918
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,800
You really want to touch it, don't you?

919
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,800
You want to touch it, don't you?

920
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,800
You want to touch it, don't you?

921
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,800
Huh?

922
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,800
The teacher is coming.

923
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,800
Why are you saying that?

924
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,800
Hey.

925
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,800
The royal gear is bad.

926
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,800
Which one do you want?

927
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:24,800
I'm sorry

928
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,800
Calm down.

929
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,800
Calm down.

930
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,800
Calm down.

931
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:31,800
Don't worry, I'll lend you a lot of money so you don't have to worry about me.

932
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,800
I'm sorry.

933
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,800
I'm sorry.

934
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,800
I'm sorry.

935
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,800
I'm sorry.

936
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:36,800
I'm sorry.

937
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,800
I'm sorry.

938
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,800
I'm sorry.

939
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:54,800
Don't worry about me. I'll lend you a lot of money.

940
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,800
Don't cry.

941
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
Don't cry.

942
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
Don't cry.

943
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,800
Don't cry.

944
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,800
Don't cry.

945
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,800
Don't cry.

946
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,800
Don't cry.

947
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,800
Don't cry.

948
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,800
Don't cry.

949
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,800
Don't cry.

950
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,800
Don't cry.

951
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,800
Don't wake up like that.

952
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,800
I'm going to wipe your tears.

953
01:33:50,800 --> 01:34:20,800
I'm sorry

954
01:34:50,800 --> 01:35:20,800
No, no

955
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:52,940
Ouch, it hurts…

956
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,500
Your beautiful wife right here is in such a bad situation.

957
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:04,860
Look at her face, she's lost a big part of her body…

958
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,400
What happened to you?

959
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,160
I'm sick?

960
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,700
Oh, sorry.

961
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
It's okay.

962
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,800
It's okay.

963
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,800
It's okay.

964
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,800
It's okay.

965
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,800
It's okay.

966
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,800
It's okay.

967
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:54,800
You're not satisfied with your husband's chimp, are you?

968
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,800
Master...

969
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,800
You like to run, don't you?

970
01:37:46,800 --> 01:38:09,800
You're talking to yourself, aren't you?

971
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:15,800
You're talking to yourself, aren't you?

972
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,800
Please drink hot water.

973
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,760
The memory is very bad.

974
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:40,860
Who were you touching just now?

975
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:43,860
It's my...

976
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,860
It's my...

977
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,860
It's my poop.

978
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,860
You touched it on your own.

979
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,860
Right?

980
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:00,860
Show it to them.

981
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:03,860
That's embarrassing.

982
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,860
It's dirty.

983
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:08,860
No, no.

984
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,860
You came here by yourself, didn't you?

985
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:14,860
Show me.

986
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:15,860
Show me.

987
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:16,860
How did you do it?

988
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,860
What a nasty finger.

989
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,860
It's so dirty.

990
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:44,860
You always do it by yourself.

991
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:50,860
You can't do anything by yourself.

992
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,860
Show me your mouth.

993
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,860
Open your mouth.

994
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,860
You're amazing, madam.

995
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,860
You're so cute.

996
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:22,860
You've grown so much.

997
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:30,860
Don't say that.

998
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:37,860
That's good.

999
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,860
You can't do such a horrible job.

1000
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,860
Right?

1001
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:45,860
You can't make your wife happy, can you?

1002
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:53,860
I can't take it anymore.

1003
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,860
Please let me go.

1004
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:59,860
Your wife didn't listen to you.

1005
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,860
I can't take it anymore.

1006
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,860
Please let me go.

1007
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,860
What do you want?

1008
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:10,860
What do you want to do here?

1009
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:22,860
I want to be close to you.

1010
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,860
Open your eyes.

1011
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,860
What do you want here?

1012
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:39,860
What's going on?

1013
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:42,860
I can't breathe.

1014
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,860
Be quiet.

1015
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:53,860
I can't breathe.

1016
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:07,860
Oh, no.

1017
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:13,860
Oh, no.

1018
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:15,860
It's bigger than the master.

1019
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:19,860
Oh, no. It's amazing.

1020
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:26,860
Ouch.

1021
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:27,860
Ouch.

1022
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:29,860
I'm going.

1023
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:30,860
I'm going.

1024
01:42:36,860 --> 01:43:06,860
Oh, oh

1025
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:08,860
Oh, it hurts!

1026
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:10,860
Oh, it hurts!

1027
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:15,860
Why?

1028
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:17,860
It hurts!

1029
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:26,860
She's gone.

1030
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,860
She's not here yet.

1031
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:36,860
I'm sorry

1032
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:08,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1033
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,860
Oh no, this is...

1034
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,860
You're really going to do this, aren't you?

1035
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:36,860
You look like a shrimp.

1036
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,860
I can't do this.

1037
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,860
I can't do this.

1038
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,860
I can't do this.

1039
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:34,860
Oh, oh

1040
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,860
Move your tongue.

1041
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:12,860
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1042
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:23,860
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1043
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:29,860
I'm sorry.

1044
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:40,860
It feels so good.

1045
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:43,860
I'm sorry.

1046
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,860
Does it feel so good?

1047
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:03,860
You're going to get in trouble.

1048
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:05,860
You're going to get in trouble.

1049
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,860
You're going to get in trouble.

1050
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,860
I'm sorry.

1051
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:21,360
I'm sorry.

1052
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,360
I'm sorry.

1053
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,360
I'm sorry.

1054
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:28,860
I'm sorry.

1055
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:30,860
I'm sorry.

1056
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,360
I'm sorry.

1057
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,860
I can't do this anymore.

1058
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,860
I can't do this anymore.

1059
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:43,860
I can't do this anymore.

1060
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,860
I can't do this anymore.

1061
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,860
I can't do this anymore.

1062
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:49,860
I can't do this anymore.

1063
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,860
I can't do this anymore.

1064
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:53,860
I can't do this anymore.

1065
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,860
I can't do this anymore.

1066
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:57,860
I can't do this anymore.

1067
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:59,860
I can't do this anymore.

1068
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:01,860
I can't do this anymore.

1069
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:03,860
I can't do this anymore.

1070
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:05,860
I can't do this anymore.

1071
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:35,860
Oh, no

1072
01:49:35,860 --> 01:50:05,860
Ah, ah

1073
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:45,860
You're going to wake her up.

1074
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:59,860
I don't know.

1075
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:02,860
What? You want me to hold you?

1076
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:05,860
You're moving by yourself.

1077
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:14,860
You're moving by yourself.

1078
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:26,860
What's going on?

1079
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:31,860
Can I take it out again?

1080
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:33,860
I haven't taken it out yet.

1081
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:35,860
What happened to your mouth?

1082
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:37,860
My mouth is the best.

1083
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,860
It's the best.

1084
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:29,860
I'm sorry

1085
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:32,860
Why?

1086
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:45,860
Why?

1087
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:29,860
No, no

1088
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:59,860
Oh, oh

1089
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:31,860
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1090
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:33,860
Ah! Ah!

1091
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:35,860
Ah! Ah!

1092
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:37,860
Ah!

1093
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:39,860
Ah! Ah!

1094
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:41,860
Ah! Ah!

1095
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:43,860
Ah! Ah!

1096
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:45,860
Ah! Ah!

1097
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:47,860
Ah!

1098
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:49,860
Ah!

1099
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:51,860
Ah! Ah!

1100
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,860
Ah! Ah!

1101
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:55,860
Ah! Ah!

1102
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:57,860
Ah! Ah!

1103
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:59,980
Don't!

1104
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:00,860
You're the best, ma'am.

1105
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:10,860
Now you're free to go.

1106
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:24,860
If you want to do it again, I'll let you do it.

1107
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:25,860
See you later.

1108
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:28,860
Take care of her.
