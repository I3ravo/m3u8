1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,300
The first day of
the trip It's so big.

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,020


3
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,260
It's about the size of a human.

4
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
It's so big.

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
It's amazing.

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,620
It's so fast.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's so big.

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,180
It's really big.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
It's getting bigger and bigger.

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,920
It's getting bigger and bigger.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,560
It's getting bigger and bigger.

12
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,550
The first time I saw
him, he was 4 years old.

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,470
He was 10 years old at that time.

14
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:18,190
This is his first time in the water.

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,750
I have never seen him in the water before.

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,130
But he still finds new things.

17
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,590
I wonder what kind of fish it is.

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm curious.

19
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,690
I wonder what kind of fish it is.

20
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,660
It looks like a carnivorous fish.

21
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,390
I wonder what kind of fish it is.

22
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,810
I wonder what kind of fish it is.

23
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:12,189
It's been a long
time since I've had a bath, but I feel

24
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:22,780
like I've been
bathed for the first time in a long time.

25
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:29,309
It's been a long
time since I've had a bath, but I feel

26
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:35,980
like I've been
bathed for the first time in a long time.

27
00:05:36,080 --> 00:06:03,910
I'm going to take a bath.

28
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,350
How was your work today?

29
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,850
It's going well.

30
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,550
If it goes like this, it's a knuckleball.

31
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,325
How about you,
Misao? I'm doing well.

32
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,690


33
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,490
How about you, Kodomo?

34
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,530
I'm not good at this.

35
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,550
How many
times do you play this month? Next.

36
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,890
Ah, that's it.

37
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,330


38
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,390
Here's your hot water.

39
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,630
Thank you.

40
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,110
What? You're already
drinking? That's fast.

41
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,650


42
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,550
That's not fair. We're drinking too.

43
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,670
Is this okay?

44
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,470
Excuse me, can I have
some sake? You're fast.

45
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,010
Let's drink.

46
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,610


47
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,750
Cheers! It smells good.

48
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,090


49
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,070
It's good, isn't it?

50
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,470
Do you feel
refreshed? Yes, I do.

51
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,426
It's been a while since
I went to a hot spring.

52
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,450
It's good.

53
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,091
It's been a while since I went to a hot
spring, so I took a bath with my brother.

54
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
How many have grown?

55
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,750
Stop it!

56
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,630
How long have you not taken a bath?

57
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,950
I haven't taken a bath for about a year.

58
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,590
I went on a trip last year.

59
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,650
You are still growing.

60
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:47,130
I was just talking about that with Akiyo.

61
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,790
About boobs?

62
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,150
I want to talk about men's boobs.

63
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,510
It's not fun to talk about men's boobs.

64
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,750
I haven't done it recently.

65
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,250
Is that so?

66
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,710
My daughter
is amazing, isn't she? No, she is not.

67
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,890


68
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,570
My daughter is amazing, isn't she?

69
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,370
She is not normal.

70
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,550
She is not normal.

71
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,830
Really?

72
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,050
You are amazing.

73
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,990
We are communicating.

74
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,870
What? Are you
Italian? No, I am not.

75
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,990
It is strange that you
don't speak Italian.

76
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,750
When I work, I speak Spanish.

77
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:26,610
Yes, yes, yes.

78
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,770
In the middle of the summer.

79
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,710
Because the work is getting late.

80
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,390
It doesn't matter.

81
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,610
It's better to do it when I'm tired.

82
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,670
When I'm tired.

83
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,390
What?

84
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,210
Our promise after marriage is like a
slogan.

85
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,730
One shot when I wake up.

86
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:43,870
What?

87
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,950
One shot when I wake up.

88
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,070
What?

89
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,350
Get up in the morning and get on the bus.

90
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,590
What?

91
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,550
My sister is like that.

92
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:52,551
What?

93
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,630
One shot at the station.

94
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,390
Really?

95
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,150
From the first
thing in the morning? Yes, yes, yes.

96
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,610
I don't want to.

97
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,650
You don't want to?

98
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,210
No, I'm not that strong.

99
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,170
Hey, Aki-kun.

100
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,090
What kind of sex are you going to have?

101
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,550
What kind of sex?

102
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,130
What kind of sex are you going to have?

103
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,030
Don't make me say that.

104
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,530
I'm curious.

105
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,610
You don't have to.

106
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,450
But I don't know anyone else.

107
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,470
It's been a while since I've
seen you, so I'm a little nervous.

108
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,030
Is that so?

109
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,030
It's my first time.

110
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,486
It's a little different from Ipe-san.

111
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,346
Wait a minute, Misa's
blood is flowing, right?

112
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,310
Well, the DNA is the same, but my
sister is also flying, so it's amazing.

113
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,250
I feel like it's empty, but what about the
action mode?

114
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,610
You're looking at this,
aren't you? Look at this.

115
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,570


116
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,510
I can't imagine from this body.

117
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,230
It's pretty amazing.

118
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,430
Is it that amazing?
What you have.

119
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,530
What I have.

120
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,030


121
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,470
Really?

122
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,910
Is it that amazing?
It's amazing.

123
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,691
I've never seen other people.

124
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,110
I don't know.

125
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,710
Show me.

126
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,870
Wait a minute.

127
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,150
You're not
a cutting board, are you? No, I'm not.

128
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:17,850


129
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm not a cutting board.

130
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:19,810
It's OK.

131
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,210
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,211
I was nervous.

133
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,650
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,010
You suddenly came to me.

135
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:29,270
You suddenly came to me.

136
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,730
I'm so worried.

137
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,950
You have such a fine thing.

138
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,050
I don't say like I'm a secretary.

139
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,310
That's not true.
You have a fine thing, too.

140
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,850
But it may be more amazing than that.

141
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,910
It's more amazing than it looks.

142
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,270
You're laughing and saying.

143
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,030
Just a little bit is fine.

144
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,810
Just a little.

145
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,070
You're a family.

146
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:00,230
It's heavy, so I can't take it off.

147
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,930
Please take off the belt.

148
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,330
I can't take it off.

149
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,210
I can't take it off.

150
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,290
You can't take it off?

151
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,510
Yes, I can't take it off.

152
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,310
We don't have that many people.

153
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,870
Don't say that.

154
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,830
It's early in the morning.

155
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,230
What's early in the morning?

156
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,470
It's early in the morning.

157
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,590
You don't have to.

158
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,430
Show me.

159
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,170
I can't see it.

160
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,291
Because... Hey, hey.

161
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,170
Hey, look at this.

162
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,270
I can't see anything.

163
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,250
Can you see anything? No, no.

164
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
It's real.

165
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,290
It's real.

166
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,250


167
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:35,790
It's real?

168
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,090
Really? It's this wide.

169
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
It's so wide.

170
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,770


171
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,330
I have one like this.

172
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,430
Can you show it to me?

173
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,670
I'm not looking at the whole thing yet.

174
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,150
Hey, you can't see anything.

175
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,010
It looks like a fish sausage.

176
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,230
No, it's not.

177
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,710
It looks like a squab.

178
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,130
It looks like a fish sausage.

179
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,510
It looks like a grilled fish.

180
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,410
No, no, no.

181
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,550
It's amazing.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,190
I touched it, but it's okay.

183
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,910
Let's eat from the top.

184
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,750
Let's eat from the top.

185
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,110
Wait a little longer.

186
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,690
Wait a little longer.

187
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,130
It's amazing.

188
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,850
What?

189
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,510
You know what?

190
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,550
What?

191
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,590
What?

192
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,850
What are you talking about?

193
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,930
We are brothers.

194
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,810
What?

195
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,850
You know, when
we are married, we get bored easily.

196
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,700
It's
not like we're going to sleep all night.

197
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,510
We're doing it every day.

198
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,210
The pattern is set.

199
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,530
But we're not that bored.

200
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,610
It's important to be energetic.

201
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,011
So... Have you ever heard of it?

202
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,530
I thought it was only about overseas.

203
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,870
I don't think that's going
to happen in Japan.

204
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,770
There are places like that.

205
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,510
You mean there is a place?

206
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,610
Since we are
here, let's change it once in a while.

207
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,370
What?

208
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,270
Are you doing such a thing?

209
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,530
Once in a while?

210
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,110
Once in a while?

211
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,990
It's good to change it once in a while.

212
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,370
It's exciting.

213
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,130
It's exciting.

214
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:25,890
But you should stop it.

215
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,910
It's exciting to be seen,
isn't it? Wait a minute.

216
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,970
Wait a minute.

217
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:30,971
Wait a minute.

218
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,730
Wait a minute.

219
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,050
You should stop it.

220
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,730
You should stop it.

221
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,570
He is eating very well.

222
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,030
He is eating very well.

223
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,530
He is eating very well.

224
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,310
He is eating very well.

225
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,090
He is eating very well.

226
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,370
He is eating very well.

227
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,590
He is eating very well.

228
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,630
He is eating very well.

229
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,370
He is eating very well.

230
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,690
What's wrong, Misato-san?

231
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,930
Why are your nipples so swollen?

232
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,830
What's wrong with you?

233
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,550
What happened to you?

234
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,590
I'm so embarrassed.

235
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,110
I've never done such a thing in my life.

236
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,310
Why is Misato's nipple so big?

237
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,870
It's as big as a bear.

238
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,150
It's big as a bear.

239
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,270
It's big as a bear.

240
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:37,690
It's big as a bear.

241
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,210
How do you feel?

242
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,530
Do you feel good?

243
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,710
Tell me honestly.

244
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:46,850
Misato.

245
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,270
What are you doing?

246
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,670
What are you doing?

247
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,930
Your belly is wet.

248
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:11,990
Your belly is getting bigger and bigger.

249
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
Your belly is getting bigger and bigger.

250
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,201
Your belly
is getting bigger and bigger, Misato-san.

251
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,700
It's not good.

252
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,720
I can't stop it! Give me more.

253
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:38,721
Give me more.

254
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,240


255
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,720
I can't stop it!

256
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,880
You can't stop it.

257
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,400
You can't stop it.

258
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Do you like it?

259
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,260
Have you ever
been blamed by a woman like this?

260
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,700
No, I don't think so.

261
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I don't think so.

262
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,300
I've blamed you so many times.

263
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm the only one who knows.

264
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,401
Then you have
to teach her the different tastes of women.

265
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Hey!

266
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Sometimes, Misano
has different tastes of men.

267
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Really?

268
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Which one
do you like more, this one or this one?

269
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,280
Sometimes you are
so nervous that your lower body is shaking.

270
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,960
I can't do it.

271
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,740
You have to do it to be brave.

272
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:55,905
Wait a minute.

273
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,760
Misato, you can't stop crying.

274
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,140
Misato, you can't stop crying.

275
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,780
Misato, you can't stop crying.

276
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:41,781
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,240
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:50,241
It's been 15 minutes.

279
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,500
Oh, my sister.

280
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Why? Look at this.

281
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Look at this.

282
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,410
Look at this.

283
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,100
It's a lot.

284
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,660
It's a lot.

285
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Let me see.

286
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,540
Let me see.

287
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,760


288
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,440
What are you
doing? Don't do that.

289
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,180


290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,900
How do you feel? I feel good.

291
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200


292
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,560
You should be more aggressive.

293
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,160
You are not aggressive.

294
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,060
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,220
Are you going to drink it?

296
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
What?

297
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,150
I'm going to drink it.

298
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
Oh, come on.

299
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,400
Just do it.

300
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
It doesn't matter whether
you drink it or not.

301
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,880
Are you excited?

302
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
No.

303
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,340
I'm excited.

304
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,300
But I can't drink it.

305
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,570
Why are you in such a hurry?

306
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,620
You are so kind.

307
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,760
You are so shy in front of your husband.

308
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,340
You are a pervert.

309
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
You are, aren't you?

310
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,440
If you weren't a pervert,
you wouldn't be so shy.

311
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Look at yourself.

312
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,380
It's so big.

313
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Look at this, Misato.

314
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,420
It looks delicious.

315
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,480
Why did you rub it so much?

316
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,860
I rubbed it from the top of my panties.

317
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Really?

318
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,980
Look at this, Misato.

319
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,700
If I rub it directly like this,
will I be able to see it? That's right.

320
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,800


321
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,640
It looks delicious as usual.

322
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,640
It's different from time to time.

323
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,400
That's right. If I
don't taste it, I'll forget your goodness.

324
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,640
That's right.
In order to know your goodness.

325
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,020
If I rub it a lot, I think you'll see it.

326
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,000
She is crying.

327
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:47,001
Look, Akio Kumara.

328
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,240
She is crying.

329
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
She is shaking her body.

330
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,020
She is shaking.

331
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,790
Akio Kumara is shaking.

332
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,370
She is crying.

333
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:14,371
You look so cute.

334
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,730
You are so slimy.

335
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,230
You are so slimy.

336
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:21,870
You are so slimy.

337
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,150
You are so slimy.

338
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,890
You are so slimy.

339
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,270
You are so slimy.

340
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,850
You are so slimy.

341
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,130
You are so slimy.

342
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,890
You are so slimy.

343
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,830
You are so slimy.

344
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,910
You are so slimy.

345
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:41,791
Do you want me to do something
for you, Misato? Rub your boobs.

346
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,810


347
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,590
It feels good,
doesn't it? I'm hungry.

348
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,230


349
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,830
What's wrong, Misato?

350
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,070
My stomach is full.

351
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,550
Full? I'm hungry.

352
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,770


353
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,590
You're amazing, Akirin.

354
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,850
Your dick is harder than mine.

355
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,210
Your dick is harder than mine.

356
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:22,990
Is it hard?

357
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,850
It's small but hard, isn't it?

358
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,050
It's really hard.

359
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,910
It's hard.

360
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,110
But when you do it, it's harder.

361
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,770
Really? I'm glad.

362
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,330
Can I do more?

363
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,550
You are good at it.

364
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,590
You are my sister.

365
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,750
Is it always hard?

366
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,110
How much do you
have in your head? Here.

367
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,810


368
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,950
Tell me how much you have in your head.

369
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,530
If you don't, you have a lot in your head.

370
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,571
You can see it, can't you?

371
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,150
I'll squeeze out all of it for you.

372
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:35,130
Misato, this is a dry golden egg.

373
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,390
You did it today, didn't you?

374
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:38,551
You did it today, didn't you?

375
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,470
It's amazing, isn't it?

376
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:48,530
Why don't you eat this?

377
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,450
You are so energetic.

378
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,670
She is still a virgin.

379
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:57,671
Oh my god!

380
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,690
I feel sick, too.

381
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,570
What?

382
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,570
Hey,

383
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,390
Do you see a doggy?

384
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,710
Wait, wait, wait.

385
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,670
What?

386
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,570
Wait, wait, wait.

387
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,400
But the smell is the same.

388
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,480
I smell it, too.

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,840
I smell it, too.

390
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I smell it, too.

391
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
No, you don't.

392
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,380
The shape is different.

393
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,800
It's been a long time.

394
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,940
It's been a long time.

395
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,940
It's been a long time.

396
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:18,941
It's been a long time.

397
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Honey.

398
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Yes?

399
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,540
Can I come in?

400
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,541
Ura-chan!

401
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
You got in!

402
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Great!

403
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Big!

404
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Great!

405
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,860
You have a great body shape!

406
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Do you feel good?

407
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
I feel good!

408
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,340
You have a lot of body fat!

409
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,740
I know!

410
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,900
You have a lot of this!

411
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
I have!

412
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,040
What's wrong?

413
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,440
Do you want me to
help you? Yes, I do.

414
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,520


415
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
What's wrong?

416
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,160
It's been a long time.

417
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,800
It's been a
long time since I had such a hard time.

418
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,080
You're not crying, are you?

419
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:48,560
You're crying a lot.

420
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:01,450
You're hungry, aren't you?

421
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,330
You're eating a lot.

422
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,350
You're hungry, aren't you?

423
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,210
You're eating a lot.

424
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:02,230
You're eating a lot.

425
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,010
What are you going to do with this?

426
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,490
You can't help it.

427
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,950
Come here.

428
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:23,050
What is it? You have so many.

429
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:32,510
What's wrong with you?

430
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,210
You're crying all of a sudden.

431
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,880
Come here.

432
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm too excited.

433
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,120
I'm so happy.

434
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,210
I'm crying.

435
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,130
I'm so happy.

436
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,410
I'm too excited.

437
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,430
I'm so happy.

438
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,000
I can't get up.

439
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,120
Misato, get up and look.

440
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,980
She's sleeping.

441
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
Look at her.

442
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,260
She's so dirty.

443
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,670
Please look at me from over there.

444
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,510
Momoko, look at me.

445
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,610
I'm in the solitude.

446
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,300
Your tears are falling into me.

447
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm going to cry.

448
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,420
Please feel good in my chest.

449
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,780
Misaki, please look at me.

450
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,330
Oh, no!

451
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:44,210
Oh, I was surprised.

452
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,770
I don't know if I can go in.

453
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,730
Wait a minute.

454
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,850
Oh, it's hot.

455
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,730
Oh, my God.

456
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,690
Mi-san, wake up.

457
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,350
Oh, my God.

458
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,220
Oh, my God.

459
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:24,010
Can I dig out a heart full of love?

460
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,170
Oh, no!

461
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:58,320
It's been a while.

462
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,540
It's been a long time
since we met last time.

463
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,320
We'll meet again tonight.

464
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
I heard that!

465
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,220
But for a while, I'll be with you.

466
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,720
Sounds like fun.

467
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,580
You don't have to go to HAPPIFY.

468
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,030
Of course.

469
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,340
We can eat together.

470
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,520
We usually eat at TAKEOFF.

471
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,100
We are tired of eating out.

472
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,260
We usually eat at TAKEOFF.

473
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,650
We eat at TAKEOFF.

474
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,810
I'm hungry.

475
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,210
I'm hungry.

476
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,450
I'm hungry.

477
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:57,970
I'm hungry.

478
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:58,971
How do you like it?

479
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,550
It's really good.

480
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,290
It's good, isn't it? It's good.

481
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:18,390


482
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,370
It's really good.

483
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,950
This is scary.

484
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,770
I want to eat half of it.

485
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,070
You were eating at that time.

486
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,310
No, I wasn't.

487
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,630
I didn't eat at all.

488
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,790
I ate a lot.

489
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,150
Let's stop it.

490
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,690
I'm in a hurry.

491
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,230
Thank you very much.

492
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,870
The soup is more than I expected.

493
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,410
Do you drink it? Yes, I do.

494
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,050
I can't drink it.

495
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:23,610
I can't drink it.

496
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,070
What are you shooting?

497
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,550
The boss told me to shoot it.

498
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,570
You all have nice Yukata.

499
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,710
Are you really
drunk? Just a little.

500
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,310
Oh my god.

501
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,730
..

502
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:46,710
I need to weigh it.

503
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,770
Is it OK?

504
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,710
OK.

505
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,910
Wait a moment.

506
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,710
You look gorgeous.

507
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,970
Let me check the weight of this.

508
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:10,970
No, wait.

509
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:12,290
You also weight the meat with the lid.

510
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,390

523
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:50,090
Huh?

524
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,880
Huh?

525
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:23,880
This is the
first time for me to eat this kind of food.

526
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:24,881
It's a bit stinky.

00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,900
This is the

534
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,960
It's good, isn't it?

535
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Cheers!

536
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,300

It's hot.

540
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I'm full.

541
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm full.

542
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,900
Please eat all the cheese.

00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:40,661
It's fun.

547
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,640
Let's go for a run.

548
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,160
We've been shooting for a long time.

549
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,440
We've been shooting for a long time.

550
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:49,280
Let's have a drink.

551
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:50,281
Where is the glass? It's broken.

552
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,380
It's OK.

553
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620


554
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,620
Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK.

555
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,400
Next.

556
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,780


557
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,000
Please wear the dress stand.

558
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
OK.

559
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
I'll put it in.

560
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,500
You look cute when you get dirty.

561
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
It's hot.

562
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
It's hot.

563
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,340
My face is getting red.

564
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
It's not red.

565
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,540
It's hot.

566
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,760
Take a picture over there.

567
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:16,000
Please take a picture of me.

568
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
It's embarrassing.

569
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,380
I'll take a picture of you.

570
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,200
Cute girls only take
pictures of their faces.

571
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,400
I'm not taking pictures of my face.

572
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,160
You are.

573
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
Go ahead.

574
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,540
What? I'm hungry.

575
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900


576
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Don't call it hungry.

577
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,300
It's an act of drunkenness.

578
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
It's a joke.

579
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,520
It's like anything.

580
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,000
My body is hot.

581
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:42,001
I'm drinking Kacchou.

582
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,480
Kacchou?

583
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,700
Kacchou is good.

584
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,940
Kacchou has a big breast.

585
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
What?

586
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,660
It has a big breast.

587
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,720
I don't have it.

588
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
It's terrible.

589
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:56,980
It's terrible.

590
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,000
It's not natural.

591
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,080
It's not natural.

592
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,760
It's natural.

593
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:06,201
I don't know because it's a uniform.

594
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,720
I don't know at all.

595
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:08,820
I made a mistake.

596
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,800
Let's drink a lot today.

597
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Let's drink a lot.

598
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
I think so.

599
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:15,900
I'm thirsty.

600
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm thirsty, too.

601
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,460
I'm thirsty, too.

602
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,420
I'm thirsty, too.

603
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,880
I'm thirsty, too.

604
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,780
I'm thirsty, too.

605
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,920
I'm thirsty, too.

606
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:29,780
I'm thirsty, too.

607
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:30,781
I'm thirsty, too.

608
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm thirsty, too.

609
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,520
I'm thirsty, too.

610
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,800
I'm thirsty, too.

611
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,500
I'm thirsty, too.

612
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:37,480
I'm thirsty, too.

613
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:37,700
I'm thirsty, too.

614
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:38,740
This is the toilet.

615
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
He is so dark.

616
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,200
This is purple.

617
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,020
His beard is missing.

618
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
What?

619
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,840
He is saying to pee.

620
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,380
That's not true.

621
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:50,860
What are you doing?

622
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
He is saying to pee.

623
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,200
He is not saying.

624
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,520
He is saying to pee.

625
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,420
Let's go to the toilet together.

626
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,260
Let's go to the toilet.

627
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
OK.

628
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,440
Don't film this.

629
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:02,860
Can you go to the toilet?

630
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,540
Why are we going to the toilet together?

631
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,620
Everyone is drinking too much today.

632
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,160
Everyone is drunk.

633
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,300
I'm enjoying it.

634
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:50,600
I want to go to the toilet.

635
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
I can pee.

636
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,480
Where are you going? Toilet.

637
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,660


638
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,300
Where are you going?

639
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,836
Isn't it suspicious to go to the toilet?

640
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,860
Isn't it suspicious?
You are drunk.

641
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,900
You are drunk.

642
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,480


643
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,220
Kato-san, you are drunk.

644
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,100
Kato-san, you are drunk.

645
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
You are drunk.

646
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,680
You should go alone.

647
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,380
It's lonely to go alone.

648
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:30,820
I'm a little lonely.

649
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,340
You are alone.

650
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
I'm lonely.

651
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,900
I want to take you to the toilet.

652
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,620
Toilet.

653
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,400
Toilet.

654
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Toilet.

655
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:41,580
Toilet.

656
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,860
Toilet is on the right.

657
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:48,160
Toilet is on the right.

658
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,460
It's hot.

659
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
It's hot.

660
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,460
It's hot.

661
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
Why are you pulling me?

662
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,000
I was just about to put my hand on you.

663
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,780
Then I'll take it off.

664
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,640
Oh, I shouldn't take it off.

665
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,160
Oh, it's the other way around.

666
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,480
Oh, it's the other way around.

667
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,860
Purple.

668
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,980
Pants? Do you like
purple? It's slippery.

669
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,580


670
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,020
What is this?

671
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:40,680
This?

672
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,980
No, it's a shimmy.

673
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
I like it.

674
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,920
Is there a shimmy?

675
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,921
Are you a girl?

676
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,840
You are so erotic.

677
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
Yes, I am.

678
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,220
Yes, you are.

679
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,640
You are wearing a white one.

680
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,620
I am a girl.

681
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,460
Really? Let me try it.

682
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,540


683
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
I am wearing a white one.

684
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,740
You are wearing a white one.

685
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:05,741
I am wearing a white one.

686
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,100
Who are you going to fight?

687
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,580
I am going to fight Kagari-chan.

688
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,520
Are you going to fight me?

689
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,761
Are you going to fight with me?

690
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,440
Are you going to fight with me?

691
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,920
Then I'll kiss you first.

692
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,100
What do you think?

693
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,340
Why are you here?

694
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,060
It's just right here.

695
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,680
It's just right here.

696
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,920
It's just right here.

697
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:22,280
It's just right here.

698
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:23,281
That's right.

699
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
I'm embarrassed.

700
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
I'm embarrassed.

701
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,220
We usually work together.

702
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:29,600
We usually work together.

703
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,680
I don't know what you're going to do
from tomorrow.

704
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,540
I don't know what you're going to do
from tomorrow.

705
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,180
I'm an adult.

706
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,040
I'm an adult.

707
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,160
I don't know anything.

708
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,520
I don't know anything.

709
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:39,920
I'm embarrassed.

710
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,780
It's okay. Don't tell anyone.

711
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,340
What if the head of the club finds out?

712
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
I've been filming you
as the head of the club.

713
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,720
I'm the head of the club now.

714
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,500
With whom? I don't know.

715
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,980


716
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,800
I want to see you.

717
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,440
I left earlier than you.

718
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,140
I don't care.

719
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,380
I don't know.

720
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,420
Are you a troublemaker?

721
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,220
Troublemaker?

722
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,060
Troublemaker? Don't say that.

723
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,380
It's hot.

724
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,820
It's hot.

725
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,601
Haru-chan, it's hot.

726
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,140
I'm laughing.

727
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,860
It's hot.

728
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,180
You're sweating.

729
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
You're sweating a lot.

730
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
I don't want to sweat.

731
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,460
Do you want me to
lick you? Lick me.

732
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,720


733
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,860
How did you do
this? I don't know.

734
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,060


735
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
How did you do this?

736
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,840
My boss did it for me.

737
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,380
Is that so?

738
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,160
I'll look at you.

739
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,960
I'll look at you.

740
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,140
Take it off.

741
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,180
I can't do it.

742
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,220
It's short.

743
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:36,221
It's short.

744
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,420
It's easy to cut.

745
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
It's easy.

746
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,660
It's hot.

747
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,280
It's hot, isn't it? It's hot.

748
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,660
It's hot.

749
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800


750
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,340
Your belly is hot.

751
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,120
Your belly is hot.

752
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,160
I'm sweating a lot.

753
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:51,700
It's beautiful.

754
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,360
You have a good body.

755
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
You have a good shape.

756
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
It's beautiful.

757
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,420
It's good.

758
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
It's beautiful.

759
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
Purple.

760
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,420
Purple? Purple.

761
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,360


762
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,740
It's really purple.

763
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,980
Purple is a fancy color.

764
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:10,760
Fancy color?

765
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,360
Do you have a bank
account? No, it's not.

766
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,300


767
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,300
It's just a plain color.

768
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,300
It's the color of dissatisfaction.

769
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,840
Yes, yes, yes.

770
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,840
It's the color of dissatisfaction.

771
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,760
When did you get this stain?

772
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,720
When did I get this stain?

773
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,620
When did you get this stain?

774
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:29,220
You guys always wear sexy clothes.

775
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:30,221
It's so colorful.

776
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,140
Well, I'm just confused
because of the alcohol.

777
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,220
You're really beautiful.

778
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
It's stained.

779
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,220
Stained? You're alive.

780
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,800


781
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,096
It's purple, so it stands out.

782
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,640
Oh, it stands out?

783
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Do you have
any stains? No, I don't.

784
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,940
No, you don't.

785
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,100


786
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:45,700
Is it a shadow?

787
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,580
Isn't it a shadow?

788
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,200
Is it a shadow? It's a shadow.

789
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
No, it's not.

790
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,920
Is it a shadow? It's a shadow.

791
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,720


792
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,420
But if you touch the
stained part, it's the tip.

793
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,040
It's not a shadow.

794
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,040
Look at this.

795
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,041
Oh, it's true.

796
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,740
It's moist.

797
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,620
Really?

798
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,720
It's like a hot spring.

799
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,680
I was in a hot spring before having a meal.

800
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,600
While saying,

801
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,440
Why? You were drinking so much.

802
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,860
It doesn't matter to me.

803
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,060
I drink alcohol.

804
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,300
It's good.

805
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,860
You said it's bad.

806
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,320
No way. It's good.

807
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
You're a virgin.

808
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,000
You are good at it.

809
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,740
You are sweating a lot.

810
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:31,741
You are good at it.

811
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,260
It's hot.

812
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,780
You are good at it.

813
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,880
You are good at it.

814
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,540
You are good at it.

815
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:53,880
You are good at it.

816
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,900
Do you usually do that?

817
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,420
I don't do that because I'm a virgin.

818
00:51:57,421 --> 00:51:58,600
She's always like a little girl.

819
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,161
She's a little girl, but she's amazing.

820
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,840
She is a girl who was born for the world.

821
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,960
Look at her eyes.

822
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:05,961
Yes.

823
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,260
It's embarrassing to see her like this.

824
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,340
See? She is closing her eyes.

825
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,920
She is smiling.

826
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,000
What are you smiling at?

827
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,220
Is that a bomb?

828
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,440
She is saying, Ah.

829
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,860
No, that's not it.

830
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,770
Here you are.

831
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,630
Oh, wait.

832
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,970
It's ticklish.

833
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,330
I can't do that.

834
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:39,830
It's ticklish.

835
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:40,050
Oh, there.

836
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,690
Look!

837
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:42,990
This is not the place.

838
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,650
You look like you actually like it.

839
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,110
I don't want to be eaten.

840
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:50,410
You look like you actually like it.

841
00:52:50,411 --> 00:52:50,890
You look like you actually like it.

842
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:51,190
I'm drunk.

843
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:52,910
I'm drunk.

844
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,750
Wait a minute.

845
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,990
Here you are.

846
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:04,390
Oh, you are a good boy.

847
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,391
Wow, you are a great boy.

848
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,790
You are a naughty boy.

849
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,030
What? Your pose.

850
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,430


851
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,990
Why are you getting used to it?

852
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,890
I'm not getting used to it.

853
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,670
What is the pose? Oh, nice.

854
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,590
Oh, it's big.

855
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,450


856
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:24,930
Wow!

857
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,310
You are so beautiful.

858
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,670
You have a big butt.

859
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,550
Actually, it's this side.

860
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,270
This side? Oh, buttocks?

861
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,390
I'm embarrassed.

862
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,830
I went to the bathroom, so I'm embarrassed.

863
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,690
What are you doing?

864
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,090
What are you doing with seaweed?

865
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,710
Seaweed?

866
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,370
Raw seaweed?

867
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,050
Tuna?

868
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,490
It's my first time to eat it.

869
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:08,950
It's tuna.

870
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,470
I ate a lot of tuna today.

871
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:11,770
It looks like raw.

872
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,190
What? It looks like raw.

873
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,950
It's warm and breathable.

874
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,150
I'm sorry.

875
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,010
You too.

876
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:26,810
Is it cold?

877
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,290
Is it good?

878
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,390
No?

879
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,750
Is it cold? It's cold.

880
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,050


881
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,510
I want to hug you.

882
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:45,150
Let me hug you.

883
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,530
It's a throw.

884
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:48,590
It's a throw.

885
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,910
It's a throw.

886
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,390
It's a throw.

887
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,270
Do you feel it?

888
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:56,770
Yes.

889
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,190
Do you feel it?

890
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,050
Yes.

891
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,530
Do you feel it?

892
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,710
Yes.

893
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,850
Do you feel it?

894
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,370
Do you feel it?

895
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:10,590
Yes.

896
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,430
My fingers are weak.

897
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,960
I can hear the sound of a baby crying.

898
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:20,890
I'll put the medicine on your neck.

899
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,690
Do you want to lick my neck?

900
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,790
Do you want me to hold your neck?

901
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,890
I'll hold your neck.

902
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:34,070
Don't do that, please.

903
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:35,751
Please take a shot and give it back to me.

904
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:36,950
No, no, no, that's not good.

905
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,250
Put it on.

906
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,990
Like this?

907
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:44,630
Like this?

908
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:45,631
Everyone is doing that.

909
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:46,870
Like this?

910
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,310
It looks good on you.

911
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,310
Does it look good on me?

912
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,850
Like this? Oh, no.

913
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,610


914
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,250
Do you have earwax? It's salty.

915
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,590
It's eel.

916
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,370
It's good.

917
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,690


918
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,030
It's my first time.

919
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:58,890
You like it, don't you?

920
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,790
It's my first time.

921
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,300
You are so clever.

922
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,320
Because it's my first time to have sex.

923
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,660
Are you sure?

924
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,220
Yes.

925
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:31,960
You are careful.

926
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:32,740
Yes.

927
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,980
You can't have
sex with your boyfriend? No, I can't.

928
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,860


929
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,640
Why?

930
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,396
I can't do it for some reason.

931
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,420
Really?

932
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,340
You are so erotic.

933
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:45,341
What is this?

934
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,620
I can't hold it.

935
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,240
Really? I can hold it.

936
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,080


937
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,320
What is this?

938
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,460
Wow, you lick it all the time.

939
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,580
How long do
you lick it? 3 seconds.

940
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,460


941
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,940
What? All the time?

942
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,400
It's coming off.

943
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,020
I'm sorry I can't help you.

944
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:04,560
No, no, no.

945
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,580
It's too late.

946
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:06,460
It'll fall off.

947
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
Oh!

948
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,900
Oh!

949
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:10,720
Oh! It's too late.

950
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:11,760
It'll fall off.

951
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,840


952
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,740
Oh!

953
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,120
Oh!

954
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,260
Oh!

955
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,100
Oh!

956
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,740
Oh!

957
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,400
Oh!

958
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:39,420
Oh!

959
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:39,480
Oh!

960
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
Oh!

961
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,300
Oh!

962
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,460
Oh!

963
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,890
It feels good, but it's embarrassing.

964
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,430
You used to be like this.

965
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:53,930
You used to be like this.

966
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,590
You used to move like this.

967
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,410
Why?

968
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,870
Because you looked like this.

969
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,610
You look so happy.

970
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,350
You look so happy.

971
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,440
You don't like it, do you?

972
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
No.

973
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,520
Why?

974
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,700
Because you are excited.

975
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,900
I'm not excited.

976
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,960
Why are you excited? No reason.

977
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:48,880


978
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,160
Because you are on the bed.

979
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,040
Yes.

980
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,636
Because you
are doing something you should not.

981
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,220
Yes, I am doing something I should not.

982
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,110
You are narrow.

983
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:07,910
Great!

984
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:32,540
Look at her mouth.

985
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,240
She has a big mouth.

986
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:36,241
What's up?

987
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,230
Wow, you are great.

988
01:03:26,231 --> 01:03:27,231
You don't pull out.

989
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:29,910
Great.

990
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,150
You are great.

991
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,090
I'm sorry.

992
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,210
Are you sleepy?

993
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,610
You're sleepy, aren't you?

994
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:41,830
You're sleepy, aren't you?

995
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,110
I want to sleep.

996
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,330
You can't. You'll get a bruise.

997
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,090
I'm fine.

998
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,590
You can't.

999
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,590
I'm fine.

1000
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,110
You can't do that.

1001
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,090
You slept a lot.

1002
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,450
You don't want to go to your mom.

1003
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,050
You don't want to go to your mom.

1004
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:03,710
It's OK.

1005
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:17,500
Do you want to go
to your mom? It's too small.

1006
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,360


1007
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,040
How do you feel? It feels good.

1008
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,880
It's a miracle.

1009
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,420
It's hard.

1010
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:29,160
It's cold.

1011
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,700


1012
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,540
You are a good girl, aren't you?

1013
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,080
You are a good girl, aren't you?

1014
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,440
You are a good girl,
aren't you? I'm nervous.

1015
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,200


1016
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,560
Are you nervous?

1017
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:24,620
What are you doing?

1018
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Where have you been?

1019
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,680
I didn't do anything.

1020
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,860
You didn't do
anything? I didn't.

1021
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,140


1022
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,140
You didn't do anything?

1023
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,360
No.

1024
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,460
You didn't do anything?

1025
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,840
No.

1026
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:46,540
You feel good, don't you?

1027
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,440
You feel good, don't you?

1028
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,300
Do you like the bag? Yes, I do.

1029
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,200
You like it, don't you?

1030
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,880
Oh, no!

1031
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,580
Look!

1032
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,680
Don't spread it! I'm sorry.

1033
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800


1034
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,340
Do you want me to put you on my lap?

1035
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:49,220
Oh, it feels good.

1036
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,680
It's good.

1037
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,420
I can't get enough of this meat.

1038
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,620
It feels so good.

1039
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,740
You're doing a good job.

1040
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,730
Are you okay?

1041
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,010
Your knees are stuck.

1042
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:01,210
Oh, it's stuck.

1043
01:10:01,211 --> 01:10:02,650
You are very good at it.

1044
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,570
You are very good at it.

1045
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,730
No, no, no.

1046
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:23,730
No, no, no.

1047
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:29,030
No, no, no.

1048
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:32,730
No, no, no.

1049
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,030
Are you a girl?

1050
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:09,370
What?

1051
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,090
Are you a girl?

1052
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,850
You are not a girl, right?

1053
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,150
Are you a girl? You are coming.

1054
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:14,890
I feel sick.

1055
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,850


1056
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,630
You are amazing.

1057
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,110
No.

1058
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,070
You are a girl.

1059
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:34,970
No.

1060
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,610
You are mean.

1061
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,690
You are moving a lot, aren't you?

1062
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Do you feel good?

1063
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:29,690
Do you want me to take it out?

1064
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,830
Do you want me to take it out?

1065
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:37,940
Ouch!

1066
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,780
Oh, my God! I'm so nervous.

1067
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,860


1068
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,760
It's all out, isn't it?

1069
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,760
I feel like it's all out.

1070
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:03,220
The amount of rice is... It's not a meal,
but it's like alcohol.

1071
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,620
Did you pee?

1072
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,080
No, I didn't pee.

1073
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,460
I didn't pee. I'm clean.

1074
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,160
Let's go to bed.

1075
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,520
I'm going to eat.

1076
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:14,980
I'm going to eat.

1077
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,160
I'm sweating.

1078
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,680
I'm going to sleep on the futon.

1079
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,220
I'm going to sleep on the futon.

1080
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,780
Who's going to sleep here?

1081
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,240
I'm going to sleep here.

1082
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:23,660
Really?

1083
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,040
Yes.

1084
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,480
What about here?

1085
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,480
The one next to you?

1086
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,260
This is the manager.

1087
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:31,160
Why are you looking at my futon so much?

1088
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,640
I'm going to be scolded.

1089
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:35,480
It's OK.

1090
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,880
Are you tired?

1091
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,180
I feel like I'm still sleeping.

1092
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,340
If you wash your feet, you'll be fine.

1093
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,700
I want to go home soon.

1094
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,640
It's cold! I'm sorry.

1095
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,320
I'm sorry.

1096
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:46,860
I'm sorry.

1097
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,220


1098
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,240
I want to go home soon.

1099
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,460
It's OK.

1100
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,620
I'll be back soon.

1101
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,420
Are you okay? It's hot.

1102
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,680


1103
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,940
Can I take off your obi?

1104
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,140
Which one?

1105
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,060
It looks painful.

1106
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,840
Please raise your hips.

1107
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,200
How do you feel?

1108
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:19,280
Are you ok? Yes, I'm fine.

1109
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,920


1110
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,640
Do you want some
water? Yes, please.

1111
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,400


1112
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,720
Where is the water?

1113
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,960
I don't have any.

1114
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,520
Are you ok? Yes, I'm fine.

1115
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000


1116
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,840
Are you going to sleep soon?

1117
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,120
Yes.

1118
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,400
Are you ok? Yes, I'm fine.

1119
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,740


1120
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,020
It was really fun today.

1121
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,040
Yes, it was fun.

1122
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,420
I'm drunk, too.

1123
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,800
Can I sleep here for a while?

1124
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:55,520
Do you want to sleep together?

1125
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,840
Can I sleep together?

1126
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,460
Everyone will come.

1127
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:02,780
I took a bath, so it's okay.

1128
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,940
Did you take
a bath? I took a bath.

1129
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,320


1130
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,820
Why did you take a
bath when you were drunk?

1131
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:11,180
I'll make you drink.

1132
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,740
Is it painful here?

1133
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,560
You touched me a lot a while
ago, didn't you? Don't touch me.

1134
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,420


1135
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,060
I can't?

1136
01:15:34,061 --> 01:15:36,100
What are you doing?

1137
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:37,101
You are limping.

1138
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:48,860
What are you doing?

1139
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:51,440
What do you think I'm doing?

1140
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,980
You can't do it because you're naked.

1141
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,820
Are you okay?

1142
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
Is this part weak? Yes, it is.

1143
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,761
Here?

1144
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,900
Don't touch here.

1145
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,900
What? You are strong.

1146
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,080


1147
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
What is this?

1148
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,260
What is this?

1149
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,040
I'm going to fall asleep.

1150
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,800
I'm going to fall asleep.

1151
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:42,960
I'm going to fall asleep.

1152
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:44,960
Kacchan is going to fall asleep, too.

1153
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,060
Hey, everyone's taking a bath.

1154
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,760
I'm going to sleep.

1155
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,300
We're taking a bath, so...

1156
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,780
I'm going to fall asleep.

1157
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,920
It's okay, right?

1158
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:01,921
Are you ready?

1159
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,240
Then, I'll kiss you.

1160
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,420


1161
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,840
What are you
doing? I'll kiss you.

1162
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,020
Like this.

1163
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,660
I'll kiss you.

1164
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,880
I'll kiss you.

1165
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,240
I'll kiss you.

1166
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,520
I'll kiss you.

1167
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,460


1168
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,960
I want to stand on this side, too.

1169
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:34,600
I want to stand on this side, too.

1170
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,720
It's hard.

1171
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,720
You have a weak neck.

1172
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,220
I have a weak neck.

1173
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,640
I want to stand on this side, too.

1174
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,120
I want to stand on this side, too.

1175
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,860
I want to stand on this side, too.

1176
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:01,861
What's wrong?

1177
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,320
I can't open my mouth.

1178
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:11,300
Let me see.

1179
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,530
Let me see.

1180
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:18,550
Let me see.

1181
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:19,270
Let me see.

1182
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:19,690
Let me see.

1183
01:18:19,691 --> 01:18:20,691
Let me see.

1184
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,090
It's too early.

1185
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,450
Let me see.

1186
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,530
Let me see.

1187
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:26,810
Let me see.

1188
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:27,891
I raised my hips by myself.

1189
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,590
Where do you feel good?

1190
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,750
I feel good all over.

1191
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:42,751
All over? You are greedy.

1192
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,530
It's hot.

1193
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:54,690
Oh, it's hot.

1194
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,890


1195
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,190
I'm glad I'm not sweating.

1196
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,570
It's hot.

1197
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:08,650
I was suffering when I was eating.

1198
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,670
I was suffering.

1199
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,750
Can I take it off? Let me see.

1200
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:18,690
It's beautiful.

1201

1203
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,670
I'm going to sleep a little longer.

1204
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:40,330
I'm going to sleep a little longer.

1205
01:19:40,331 --> 01:19:47,750
I'm going to sleep a little longer.

1206
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:58,890
You are beautiful.

1207
01:19:58,891 --> 01:19:59,910
Am I beautiful?

1208
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:01,950
You are beautiful.

1209
01:20:01,951 --> 01:20:03,010
I'm sweating a lot.

1210
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,750
I'm sweating a lot.

1211
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:06,250
I'm sweating a lot.

1212
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:06,430
I'm sweating a lot.

1213
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:06,910
I'm sweating a lot.

1214
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,870
I'm sweating a lot.

1215
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:09,090
I'm sweating a lot.

1216
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:09,310
I'm sweating a lot.

1217
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,510
I'm sweating a lot.

1218
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,610

I'm sweating a lot.

1223
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,490
What is it?

1224
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,530
What is it?

1225
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:33,910
Maybe he got drunk and passed out.

1226
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:59,260
Oh, I rubbed it.

1227
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,800
Are you okay? I rubbed it.

1228
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:04,860


1229
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,640
I can't stand it anymore.

1230
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:11,340
I rubbed it.

1231
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,500
It feels so good.

1232
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,580
I'm sorry.

1233

It feels good, doesn't it?

1237
01:21:48,711 --> 01:21:49,751
It feels good,
doesn't it? It tickles.

1238
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,490
It tickles.

1239
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:07,870


1240
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:13,230
It tickles, doesn't it?

01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:43,230
Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay.

1246
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:50,270
It's okay.

1247
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:53,810
As it is.

1248
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:58,570
As it is.

1249
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:00,250
It's open.

1250
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:09,570
It's open.

1251
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,110
It's open.

1252
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:15,150
It's open.

1255
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:37,020
I put it in my mouth.

1256
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:44,680
Because I can't do it anymore.

1257
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:56,060
It feels good.

1258
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,300
Oh my god.

1259
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,200
Oh my god.

1260
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,940
Oh my god.

01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,840
What's going on? Oh, it's hot.

1262
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:23,580


1263
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,920
Oh, it feels good.

1264
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,120
The sound is good.

1265
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,080
I feel like I'm in space.

1266
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,340
Oh, it's great.

They did it!

1272
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:59,160
I can't believe it.

1273
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,800
I'm sorry.

1274
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,600

Oh, my god!

1322

It's disgusting.

1323
01:40:17,901 --> 01:40:19,261
You have black spots on your eyes.

Oh, no! I'm scared.

1325

Oh, my god.

1329

I see.

1331
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,260
I'm going to take a bath.

1332
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,920
Did you drink a lot? Yes, I did.

1333
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,500


1334

You just drank a lot.

1335
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,660
I think it's over after this.

1336
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,500
Do you want to go somewhere to drink?

1337
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:18,140
Are you OK?

1338
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,940
We don't have enough time.

1339
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:21,200
You want to drink, don't you?

1340
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,160
Maybe I want to drink a little.

1341
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:24,700
You are drunk.

1342
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,960
Do you want
to go to a shop or go shopping? Let's go.

1343
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,200


1344
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,880
I'm really drunk.

1345
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,280
I'm really drunk.

1346
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,840
Let's go together.

1347

This way.

1351
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,221
A few days later Are

1352
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,480


1353
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,860
You were sleeping.

1354
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,380
Yes, I was sleeping.

1355
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,920
I was about to fall asleep, but I didn't.

1356
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,620
I hope no one will come today.

1357
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,660
It's so quiet here.

1358
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,940
Yes, it is.

1359
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,260
What would you like to drink?

1360
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:12,980
I'll have a lemon tea.

1361
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:14,300
Lemon tea?

1362
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,480
Yes.

1363
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:21,940
Nice to meet you.

1364
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:24,940
Nice to meet you, too.

1365
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,940
Me, too.

1366
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:32,460
This is the first time to go
on a business trip, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1367
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:33,980
I'm so excited.

1368
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:35,260


1369
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,040
I drank too much yesterday.

1370
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:41,180
Everyone drinks too much today.

1371
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,420
It's not like work, is it?

1372
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,180
It's fun, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1373
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:45,360


1374
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,960
I'm glad I came here.

1375
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:48,680
I'm glad to hear that.

1376
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,560
You look like a girl who wears a yukata.

1377
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:52,840
Yes, I do.

1378
01:42:52,841 --> 01:42:55,001
I'm wearing a
yukata because the tree is falling down.

1379
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,056
You don't have
a boyfriend now, do you? No, I don't.

1380
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:01,840


1381
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,456
I don't have a boyfriend for a long time.

1382
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,200
You don't have
a boyfriend for a long time? Yes, I do.

1383
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,140


1384
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,880
I had a boyfriend until two months ago.

1385
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,840
You don't have a boyfriend.

1386
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:20,600
You are getting drunk.

1387
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:22,820
I am.

1388
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,660
You are getting drunk.

1389
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,320
It's just two of us.

1390
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,380
Are you okay? Are you drunk?

1391
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,240
Are you drunk? Yes, I am.

1392
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:46,540


1393
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,700
You should drink more.

1394
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:50,840
You are weak.

1395
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,140
I am weak.

1396
01:43:52,141 --> 01:43:53,400
Koko-chan is cute!

1397
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,200
She kept laughing a while ago.

1398
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:56,380
Was she laughing?

1399
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:58,100
She was laughing and making fun of me.

1400
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
That was funny.

1401
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,020
It's your first time, isn't it?

1402
01:44:05,021 --> 01:44:06,021
I don't think so.

1403
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:09,860
You startled me.

1404
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,900
I don't think so.

1405
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:16,680
You're not good.

1406
01:44:16,681 --> 01:44:16,840
I'm not good.

1407
01:44:16,841 --> 01:44:17,140
It's a lie.

1408
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:18,700
It's a lie.

1409
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,840
But you won't tell anyone,
will you? No, I won't.

1410
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,100
You can work.

1411
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,520


1412
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:26,980
You're fashionable.

1413
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:28,740
You're fashionable.

1414
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:34,860
I don't know
if it's safe, but you have a big chest.

1415
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,340
I don't know
if it's safe, but you have a big chest.

1416
01:44:37,341 --> 01:44:37,840
I don't know
if it's safe, but you have a big chest.

1417
01:44:37,841 --> 01:44:38,780
I don't know
if it's safe, but you have a big chest.

1418
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:40,380
I don't know
if it's safe, but you have a big chest.

1419
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,620
What cup is that? Green cup.

1420
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:42,820
Green cup.

1421
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:43,420
Green cup.

1422
01:44:43,421 --> 01:44:43,580
Green cup.

1423
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:44,740
I can't do it.

1424
01:44:44,741 --> 01:44:47,440
I'll be seen by
everyone, won't I?

1425
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,560
I was conscious of it.

1426
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,440
You know what?

1427
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,580
I've been thinking about it all day today.

1428
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,500
About the banquet?

1429
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,500
The president asked me to shoot it,
but it's noisy.

1430
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,780
I'm going to shoot it now.

1431
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,380
You said you wanted
to take a picture of me.

1432
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,480
I was lying.

1433
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,520
I said I wanted to take a picture of you.

1434
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:18,940
I don't like this.

1435
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,020
You are cute.

1436
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,800
Do you look at me?

1437
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,540
I don't look at you.

1438
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:27,340
Don't you look at me?

1439
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,480
I don't look at you.

1440
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:31,481
I don't look at you.

1441
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,480
You are warm.

1442
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,320
You drank a lot.

1443
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,480
I drank a lot.

1444
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,200
You drank a lot, didn't you?

1445
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:50,320
Your face is so red.

1446
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,360
I always show my face.

1447
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:54,960
You are fine. You are cute.

1448
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,460
It's hot.

1449
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:02,060
You are so cute.

1450
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,360
It's getting hotter and hotter.

1451
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,300
Why so suddenly?

1452
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Why? Is it bad?

1453
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,320
It's not bad, but I was surprised.

1454
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,880
It's warm.

1455
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,260
I'm hot, too.

1456
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:26,840
I'm hot, too.

1457
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,900
It's so hot.

1458
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:28,400
It's cute.

1459
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:29,920
It's cute.

1460
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:30,640
It's cute.

1461
01:46:30,641 --> 01:46:31,140
It's cute.

1462
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:31,700
It's cute.

1463
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,920
It's cute.

1464
01:46:35,921 --> 01:46:38,940
You don't want to come back, do you?

1465
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,060
Where did everyone
go? It's warm.

1466
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,140


1467
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:00,850
Are you going to take off your sweater?

1468
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:02,670
I don't want to.

1469
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:06,030
I want to take a picture of a cute girl.

1470
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,450
You're not cute. You're red.

1471
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:09,910
You're just a red person.

1472
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:21,150
I'm sorry.

1473
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:22,810
Really?

1474
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:26,140
What should I do?

1475
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:28,470
Why?

1476
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:31,790
Because of this
distance? It's dangerous.

1477
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:34,890
It's dangerous.

1478
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:37,931
Do you like it?

1479
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,660
I'll take you to the vet soon.

1480
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,940
Are you sick? No, I'm not.

1481
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:09,220


1482
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:25,360
I'll take you to the vet soon.

1483
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,280
I'll take you to the vet soon.

1484
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,640
Wait.

1485
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,800
My face is getting red.

1486
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,900
You're not at home, are you?

1487
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:38,800
I'm not at home, but
I said I wasn't at home.

1488
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,760
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

1489
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:49,640
Why do you ask such
a question? I'm sorry.

1490
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:58,050
I'm sorry.

1491
01:48:59,070 --> 01:48:59,470
It's okay.

1492
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:00,690
I'm sorry.

1493
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:06,170
I'm sorry.

1494
01:49:06,171 --> 01:49:07,790
I was going to do that.

1495
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:09,730
No?

1496
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:12,210
I didn't notice.

1497
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:20,110
I was going to do that.

1498
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:22,310
What's going on?

1499
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,010
I was going to do that.

1500
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:29,740
Let me see.

1501
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:39,190
Wow.

1502
01:49:39,191 --> 01:49:40,750
You drink a lot.

1503
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:50,380
You drank too much.

1504
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:52,900
Are you cold? No, I'm fine.

1505
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,440


1506
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:56,280
You didn't
touch the room, did you? No, I didn't.

1507
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,940
I was just reflecting.

1508
01:49:58,680 --> 01:49:59,680
I was in front of you.

1509
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:03,220
I'm having a lot of fun.

1510
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,960
Are you drunk?

1511
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:06,600
Huh?

1512
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:07,820
I feel like you're drunk.

1513
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:11,561
If no one comes... I don't know what
you're doing.

1514
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:19,580
I don't know what you're doing.

1515
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,920
I don't know what you're doing.

1516
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:21,180
I don't know what you're doing.

1517
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:21,740
I don't know what you're doing.

1518
01:50:21,741 --> 01:50:22,981
I don't know what you're doing.

1519
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:25,716
I don't know what you're doing.

1520
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:26,816
I don't know what you're doing.

1521
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,056
I don't know what you're doing.

1522
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,020
I don't know what you're doing.

1523
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:32,900
I don't know what you're doing.

1524
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,620
I don't know what you're doing.

1525
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:41,030
I don't know what you're doing.

1526
01:50:46,510 --> 01:51:03,610
I don't know what you're doing.

1527
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,650
You are good at it.

1528
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,480
You should go home.

1529
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,330
Everyone is drinking.

1530
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:20,080
It's funny to talk about it.

1531
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:21,380
Everyone is funny.

1532
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,710
I feel like I'm going to come back.

1533
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:28,890
It's OK.

1534
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:30,246
You will be sleepy when you come back.

1535
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:31,890
I haven't slept yet.

1536
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:33,670
I haven't.

1537
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:35,190
Did you drink too much?

1538
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,810
Yes.

1539
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:37,190
I haven't slept yet.

1540
01:51:37,610 --> 01:51:38,710
You are great.

1541
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:40,590
You ate too much.

1542
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,400
Did it hurt? Oh my god.

1543
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,260
It's so big.

1544
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:13,840


1545
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,480
You don't remember when you
get drunk in the morning, do you?

1546
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,440
I don't know if I'm not that drunk.

1547
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,480
But it's embarrassing to
remember when we're all together.

1548
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:47,660
I don't know if I'll keep it a secret.

1549
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:54,260
What's wrong? Long time no see?

1550
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,680
Yeah, it's been a while.

1551
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,520
It's warm. Your hands are very warm.

1552
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:13,730
You are energetic even if you drink water.

1553
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:15,890
Thank you.

1554
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:16,970
You are amazing.

1555
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,210
You are warming up.

1556
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:23,970
You have a very erotic face.

1557
01:53:24,990 --> 01:53:25,250
What?

1558
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:26,430
You have a very erotic face.

1559
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:29,190
Have I changed from before?

1560
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:34,690
Why are you doing that?

1561
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:36,950
Because I like it.

1562
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:39,290
I feel good.

1563
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:41,430
You are so sexy.

1564
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:54,330
Your lips are too big.

1565
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:55,550
I think you will get cold.

1566
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:57,270
Really?

1567
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:59,910
I think you will get cold.

1568
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:02,070
I got caught.

1569
01:54:02,071 --> 01:54:04,590
Oh, it's cold.

1570
01:54:05,150 --> 01:54:06,230
Oh, it's cold.

1571
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:13,690
Oh, it's cold.

1572
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:18,190
Oh, it's cold.

1573
01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:20,790
Oh, it's cold.

1574
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:24,070
Oh, it's cold.

1575
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,020
Oh, it's cold.

1576
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:34,020
Oh, it's cold.

1577
01:54:34,021 --> 01:54:34,100
Oh, it's cold.

1578
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:34,200
Oh, it's cold.

1579
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:34,260
Oh, it's cold.

1580
01:54:34,261 --> 01:54:34,820
Oh, it's cold.

1581
01:54:34,821 --> 01:54:35,380
Oh, it's cold.

1582
01:54:35,381 --> 01:54:36,381
Oh, it's cold.

1583
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:43,530
I'm crying.

1584
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:47,710
I don't like such a bright place.

1585
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,340
I feel so good.

1586
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:30,460
I'm crying.

1587
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:54,050
Wow, it's so warm.

1588
01:55:55,110 --> 01:56:07,400
Wow, it's so warm.

1589

I'm sorry.

1593
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,840
I didn't mean to kill you.

1594
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,360
I didn't mean to kill you.

1595
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:50,030
I'm sorry.

1596

It's around the back of my back.

1608
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:14,800
It's tickling.

1609
02:01:14,801 --> 02:01:15,801
You are going to sleep.

1610
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,950
You have a lot of hair.

Wow, it's amazing.

1620
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:21,980
It's like a gori gori.

1621
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:23,660
Is it hard? It's very hard.

1622
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:25,080


1623
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:28,800

Oh, it feels good.

1625

I can hear the sound.

1626
02:02:36,321 --> 02:02:37,840
I can't believe it.

1627
02:02:37,841 --> 02:02:38,841
Are you okay?

1628
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:42,780
I can't believe it.

1629
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,180
I can't believe it.

1630
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,760
I can't believe it.

1631
