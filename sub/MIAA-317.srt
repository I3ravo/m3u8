1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,540
Hi, mom.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm innocent.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,940
I'm being investigated
and I'm living alone.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,620
Mom...

5
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,580
Mr. Tateo Haneda?

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,780
I didn't do anything wrong.

7
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,430
What's going on?

8
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,850
Why?

9
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,430
What's going on?

10
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,310
You can't take such a serious action.

11
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,270
But...

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Let's go.

13
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,290
I didn't do anything.

14
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,370
I didn't do anything.

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,760
Why don't you quit smoking?

16
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,380
I didn't quit smoking.

17
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,260
Give up already.

18
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:19,086
We have proof that you are a
member of the drug organization.

19
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,500
I don't know anything about that.

20
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,051
Then, what were you doing in
such a place in the middle of the day?

21
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,620
No, I was just doing my job.

22
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,920
You were really trying to sell
drugs, weren't you? No, I wasn't.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,320
That's enough.

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100


25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,400
Where is the place where drugs
are manufactured and traded?

26
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,341
What kind of secret organization
is involved? I don't know.

27
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,740
I didn't do it.

28
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,980
Do not deny it.

29
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,400
No, I didn't do it.

30
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,260
It's not good to deny it.

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Spit it out.

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,400
No, I really didn't do it.

33
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:10,895
Kurata-san.

34
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,990
That.

35
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
Yes.

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,750
Do it quickly.

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
What are you saying?

38
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,870
Aren't you hungry?

39
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,330
If you want to eat, you have to confess.

40
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,570
No, I really didn't do it.

41
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,610
Stop it.

42
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,611
What are you doing? Admit it.

43
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,610
No, I don't.

44
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,430
Do you still want to play
Shira-Uki-Uki? No, I don't.

45
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,150


46
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,080
OK, I'll give you a lot of time.

47
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,071
I'll let you play all at the end.

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
No, I don't.

49
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,001
I can't believe it.

50
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,080
Why did this happen?

51
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,941
Do you have the courage
to tell the truth? But I.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,850
..

53
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,390
It will be easier if you tell the truth.

54
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,630
Come on, stand up.

55
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,470
I'll help you.

56
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,090
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,730
Hey, how long are you
going to keep doing this?

58
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,330
What?

59
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:39,915
Do you have a girlfriend?

60
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,900
Well, I have one.

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,361
Don't you feel sorry for her?

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,740
Don't you want to admit
your sin and reset your life?

63
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:55,741
Don't you think so?

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,060
No, I didn't do it.

65
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
I see.

66
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,426
You don't confess no matter what happens.

67
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,860
Then, we have no
choice but to go out today.

68
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,240
What are you
doing? Go on a date.

69
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820


70
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm investigating.

71
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,481
Are you done?

72
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,440
You don't open your mouth,
so I'm going to ask your body.

73
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,220
I didn't do it.

74
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Shut up.

75
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,420
I know you didn't do it.

76
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,380
Why?

77
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,320
Don't think your body is honest.

78
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,640
Don't move.

79
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,641
Don't move.

80
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Be quiet.

81
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,150
You are listening to me.

82
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,640
I am listening to you.

83
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,420
I won't exclude you forever.

84
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,590
I am not doing it.

85
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
You are persistent.

86
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,420
Oh,

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,640
What?

88
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,180
What? Move your hand.

89
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,900


90
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,360
You are already standing.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,100
I am standing.

92
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,660
You are standing in such a situation.

93
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:31,100
How can you stand up on your own?
You are so mean.

94
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,880
I didn't do anything.

95
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,540
You made your nipples so hard.

96
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,040
What are you thinking about?

97
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,540
I think people who don't
admit their sins are fat.

98
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,480
I don't care.

99
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,580
You don't care?

100
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:57,100
Don't you understand?
Why do you say such a thing?

101
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,480
I don't say such a thing.

102
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,280
How long are you going to
keep saying such a thing?

103
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,880
Are you still saying such a thing?

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Oh, you are right.

105
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,010
In such a situation, how long are you going
to keep saying such a thing? You are right.

106
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,150


107
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,350
If you were a normal
man, you wouldn't stand up.

108
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,930
No, it's not like that.

109
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,870
You're a villain to be able
to stand in such a situation.

110
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,930
No, I didn't do it.

111
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,970
Don't deceive us.

112
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,050
Really.

113
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,370
I didn't do it.

114
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,350
No matter how long it
takes, I'll make you spit it out.

115
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,600
Did you want to spit it out?

116
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,700
No, I really didn't do it.

117
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
Please be quiet.

118
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,530
Don't you want to confess
your sin? No, I don't.

119
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,210


120
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:10,050
You have to admit your sin.

121
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,110
Otherwise, you will lose your body.

122
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,590
No, I don't want to lose my body.

123
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,350
Or do you want to be tortured forever?

124
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,330
No, I don't want to be tortured.

125
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,510
Come here.

126
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,170
Don't sit here.

127
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,970
Look at this.

128
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,950
It's too big.

129
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,930
Did you do this?

130
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,850
No.

131
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,030
Yes, yes, yes.

132
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,730
You skipped work and watched something
so disgusting, didn't you? No, I didn't.

133
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,470


134
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,010
Oh, I made a mistake.

135
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,210
You didn't skip work. You were waiting
for a deal, weren't you? No, I wasn't.

136
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,370


137
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,370
You were waiting for a deal,
but you looked so relaxed.

138
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,430
No, I wasn't. I was just skipping work.

139
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
You are so noisy.

140
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,530
You are so noisy.

141
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,040
Are you still not talking?

142
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,360
Don't you want to
cut it? No, I don't.

143
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,640


144
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,400
I'll make you want to cut it.

145
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,900
No, I don't.

146
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,700
Oh, you're really doing it.

147
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,100
Are you happy? No, I'm not.

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,140
Show me your happy face.

149
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,141
Show it to me.

150
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I'm not angry.

151
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
You are angry.

152
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,740
You want me to kiss
you, don't you? No, I don't.

153
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,840


154
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,860
You don't confess your love, but
you open your mouth to kiss me.

155
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,860
No, I don't.

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
You are strange.

157
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm not angry.

158
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:13,461
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,630
You can't say anything.

160
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,870
You can't go against me.

161
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,430
I'm investigating you.

162
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,270
Look at this.

163
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,850
This is my embarrassing nipple.

164
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,710
Pink!

165
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,730
Can't you change your girlfriend's nipple?

166
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:41,731
Don't you play with me?

167
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,230
It doesn't matter.

168
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,910
Poor you.

169
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,480
How do you feel? Do you
want to confess? No, I don't.

170
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,120
I don't know.

171
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,800
Say everything.

172
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,400
You look like you are in pain.

173
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,680
You don't need this
because it's a check-up.

174
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,580
Take it off.

175
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,480
You are wearing ugly panties.

176
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,320
Why are you like this? Tell me.

177
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:54,120
I don't know.

178
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,860
You don't know, do you?

179
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,780
Why are you like
this? I don't know.

180
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,000


181
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,020
Why?

182
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,860
You don't know?

183
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,800
Then I'll make you understand.

184
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,121
Do you want me to do it with you?

185
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:21,160
You must have won because you thought of
something unpleasant in our investigation.

186
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,760
No, I didn't.

187
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:26,761
You didn't?

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No.

189
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,920
Do you want to do it together?

190
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,560
What's up?

191
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,040
What do you think?

192
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,270
If you don't want to be
trapped in this house,

193
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,670
tell me which organization you belong to.

194
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,240
I don't know. I can't tell you.

195
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,180
Well, it can't be helped.

196
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll let you have fun for a while.

197
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:14,726
I don't know if it's a good idea or not

198
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,560
I'll keep torturing you until you give up.

200
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,820
No.

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,480
No matter how long I keep torturing
you, I don't know how long I can bear it.

202
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,150
I told you.

203
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,040
We've heard so many times
that villains don't do that.

204
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,700
I've heard it many times.

205
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
Everyone says so.

206
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,320
It's great.

207
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,000
You just pretend to hate it.

208
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,860
I don't know.

209
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,300
But you are good at acting.

210
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,040
No, I'm not.

211
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:36,840
I can't trust you.

212
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,500
What's wrong?

213
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:51,660
Your son is being made my footwear.

214
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,020
It's not fair.

215
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,980
Oh, you feel good with your legs.

216
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,880
You are still big. I'm embarrassed.

217
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,640
Do you like to be treated like this?

218
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,340
No, I've never been treated like this.

219
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,260
You are not happy, are you?

220
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
My neck feels good.

221
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,580
How long can you bear it?

222
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,621
I wonder if you can do it.

223
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,260
It's about time.

224
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,020
What's wrong?

225
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,820
This is your leg.

226
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
What?

227
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,680
Is your leg that good?

228
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
What?

229
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
What?

230
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Are you going to do it? Stop it.

231
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,460


232
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,500
Why are you making such a sad face?

233
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,260
Did you think you could do it?

234
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,261
Did you have a
fever? No, I didn't.

235
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,100
Oh, it hurts.

236
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,101


237
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,950
Like this?

238
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Like this? I'm sorry.

239
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,660


240
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
You can do it this time.

241
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Do you want to
do it? No, I can't.

242
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,041
Do you want to do
it again? No, I can't.

243
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300


244
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,080
How do you feel? No, I can't.

245
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:13,020
Oh, I see.

246
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040


247
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,660
Did you want to
go? No, I didn't.

248
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,110


249
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,730
You couldn't go? No, I couldn't.

250
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,210
You're so cute.

251
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,270


252
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll let you go if you
confess all your sins.

253
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,470
Really?

254
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,610
I didn't confess my sins.

255
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,510
You're so cute.

256
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,630
I'll let you go if you
confess all your sins.

257
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,750
You're breathing, aren't you?

258
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:50,110
She's just breathing, but she's trembling.

259
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,350
Her hands are so warm.

260
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,070
It's not like this yet.

261
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,570
The golden egg is jiggly.

262
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,570
She's eating a lot of noodles.

263
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,110
Hurry up and tell me everything.

264
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,970
Why don't you just give it to me here?

265
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,110
You're holding back, aren't you?

266
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,330
Don't go, just tell me.

267
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,290
I'm not doing it.

268
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,130
How about this?

269
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,450
You like it, don't
you? No, I don't.

270
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,810
Just tell me.

271
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,190


272
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
I'm not doing it.

273
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:51,930
Oh, you ate it all.

274
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,020
You are so patient.

275
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Yes, I am.

276
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,660
How long will you be so patient?

277
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,340
I won't finish until you finish all.

278
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,220
At that time, Chimpanzee
may have never met.

279
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
I don't know.

280
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Are you sure?

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,860
Are you protecting your friends?

282
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,080
I don't have any friends.

283
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,160
You have.

284
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,201
You don't like it,
do you? No, I don't.

285
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,340


286
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,980
Then you should tell me.

287
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,680
I don't know.

288
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,500
Tell me.

289
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,460
You can't tell me? I don't know.

290
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,860


291
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,000
I was just doing my job.

292
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Your job?

293
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,380
You were just watching TV, weren't you?

294
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,980
What? Or is it your job to
make a noise? No, it's not.

295
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,200


296
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,480
There is no such a stupid job.

297
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,100
I used to do such a job.

298
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Make a noise?

299
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
No.

300
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,500
Watch porn?

301
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,060
No, I was just touching.

302
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,020
That porn is such a camouflage.

303
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,760
No, I was just touching.

304
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm sorry. I can't forgive you anymore.

305
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:53,080
Forgive me? You can't forgive me?

306
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,280
Is that what everyone has been saying?

307
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,500
You guys say you can't forgive me.

308
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,560
But everyone was a criminal.

309
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:10,740
You were the first one. You are the
same, aren't you? We won't be deceived.

310
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Come on.

311
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:31,560
You didn't come out. You poor thing.

312
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:32,820
What's wrong with you?

313
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,510
You've got a cramp in your leg.

314
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,530
Oh, it hurts.

315
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,430
Does it hurt?

316
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,150
You've been looking at this
for a while, haven't you? No, it's.

317
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,950
..

318
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,410
Look, it's a woman's body.

319
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,000
You've been looking at a woman's
body, so it's a man's body, isn't it?

320
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,170
No...

321
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:03,395
I'm telling you to look at
it, so look at it properly.

322
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Your nipple.

323
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:15,500
Your nipple and my nipple.

324
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,260
You just made a good voice.

325
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,600
Your nipple is getting harder.

326
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
That's right.

327
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,120
Do you feel good? No, I don't.

328
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,020


329
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,520
Your brain will be cut off
if you hold it for too long.

330
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,760
I'll give you a lot of
tickling from this side.

331
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,780
From the left and right?

332
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,080
That's good, isn't it?

333
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,420
Can you stand it?

334
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,420
I haven't done it yet.

335
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:02,060
You're such a pervert.

336
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,820
I think you'll get a
lot of dust if I hit you.

337
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,240
Don't you have any other sins?

338
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,660
No, I didn't do anything.

339
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,660
You didn't do anything, did you?

340
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,661
I really didn't.

341
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,340
Really?

342
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,900
I wonder if you did.

343
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,240
You're blushing.

344
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,600
You're sweating.

345
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,900
It's embarrassing.

346
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:26,901
That's cool.

347
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
What's wrong?

348
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,490
Does it feel good,
Chin-chin? No, not that.

349
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000


350
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
What's not good? Don't.

351
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,460
..

352
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:37,981
Do you want me to hit you on the neck?

353
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,236
Do you want me to
pinch your ear? Please.

354
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
..

355
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
What?

356
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,190
Are you gonna
come out? I like it.

357
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,540
Do you want to be a
warrior at Torihiro Festival?

358
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,160
No...

359
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,180
Tell me.

360
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,740
If you say, I forgive you.

361
00:23:52,741 --> 00:24:07,606
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

362
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:22,720
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come

363
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,810
Did you say, you're about to say?

364
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Yes.

365
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
You're about to
confess? No, I didn't.

366
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,180
Say it.

367
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:29,181


368
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,280
I didn't, so I don't know.

369
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
I'll give you a pill.

370
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,210
You're about to say?

371
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,840
You're about to go?

372
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,760
No, I'm about to go.

373
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
You're about to go?

374
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Yes.

375
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
You're not about to say?

376
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,360
No, I don't know.

377
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
You don't know?

378
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
You're an idiot.

379
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,500
Come on, ring the bell.

380
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,501
Hurry up and do it.

381
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,580
Hurry up.

382
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I got it.

383
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm telling you to do it, so do it.

384
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,020
Do you want to be blamed for
unnecessary sins? Come here.

385
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,180
Don't sleep.

386
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
You look good.

387
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260


388
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,290
You don't have the courage to say it yet.

389
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,900
I don't know what to say
because I haven't done it yet.

390
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
You are persistent.

391
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,740
Then, I'll torture you.

392
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,400
No, I don't want to.

393
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,580
You don't have to say anything.

394
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,740
I can't breathe.

395
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,940
Wait a minute.

396
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,220
If you don't want to do it, say it now.

397
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,440
Did you do it? Didn't
you do it? I don't know.

398
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420


399
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
You don't know,
do you? I didn't do it.

400
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920


401
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
What?

402
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,520
What? I can't hear what you're saying.

403
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:15,521
I can't hear you.

404
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Pochinchi.

405
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Binbin.

406
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Look at you.

407
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,400
How was it? Was it painful?

408
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,180
No, it was painful.

409
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
You didn't say anything.

410
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:32,405
I thought you didn't need
such a white-faced mouth.

411
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,320
I think it's about time
for you to take the test.

412
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:41,441
Can I take a picture of you?

413
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,160
You are still a baby, aren't you?

414
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
You are still not good at
it, aren't you? I'm sorry.

415
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600


416
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,960
How do you feel?

417
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Do you feel better?

418
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,580
Can you forgive me?

419
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Why? Why?

420
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,620
I didn't say that.

421
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
Hey.

422
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,040
It's not over yet.

423
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,520
Until you say it.

424
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
I didn't do it.

425
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,160
If you don't say it quickly,
you'll really suffocate.

426
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Are you sure?

427
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,560
Yes.

428
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Huh?

429
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:35,920
I'll say it now.

430
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
I didn't do it.

431
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,820
I really didn't do it.

432
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,680
Oh, no. You are getting wet.

433
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,380
Oh, no. You are getting wet.

434
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
How do you feel?

435
00:27:58,305 --> 00:27:59,520
Do you feel better? No, I don't.

436
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,780
Please forgive me.

437
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,480
Do you want to be wet?

438
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
No.

439
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,280
Do you want me to lick you?

440
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Let me see your tongue.

441
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,040
You don't want me to lick you, do you?

442
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,760
Let me see your tongue.

443
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:19,961
I said let me see your tongue.

444
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,820
I'll make you wet more.

445
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,120
Oh, it's hot.

446
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,900
You're having fun, aren't you?

447
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,580
You haven't said it yet
because you want to continue?

448
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,640
It's painful, isn't it?
Because it's torture.

449
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,040
If you don't want to, don't say
you're the culprit of the drug deal.

450
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
No, I don't want to.

451
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,060
This is the last one.

452
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm not doing it.

453
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,780
I've never done such a thing.

454
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,340
You have a bad sense of direction.

455
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,350
Do you want me to make
it easy for you to say?

456
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
Easy for me to say?

457
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,950
What do you want me to do?

458
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,830
If I do it gently like this,

459
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,290
you may feel a little painful.

460
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,430
I don't know yet.

461
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,650
I don't know how to do it.

462
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,850
You don't know?

463
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,330
Then I'll teach you.

464
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,610
Does it feel good?

465
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,050
You like it, don't
you? A little.

466
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,090


467
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,370
Does it feel good?

468
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,890
Do you want to come
here? No, you can't.

469
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,090


470
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,490
I'll give you a massage.

471
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,150
You love me, don't you?

472
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,990
I'll make you feel good.

473
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,830
Does it hurt? No, it doesn't.

474
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,310


475
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,730
I can't do that.

476
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,670
Does it hurt?

477
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,960
You thought you could do it, didn't you?

478
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,290
You don't admit it, do you?

479
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,170
Do you want to be treated
gently like this? No, I don't.

480
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,490


481
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,650
I didn't ask you to lick me.

482
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,250
What?

483
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:02,010
You're the only one who's been chasing me.

484
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,070
Really?

485
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,450
You're the only one.

486
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,930
It's strange.

487
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,290
Wait a minute.

488
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,110
Hurry up.

489
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
Give me a pen.

490
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,070
Hey.

491
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,290
Hurry up.

492
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,270
Hurry up.

493
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,490
Hey!

494
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,950
It's been a long time.

495
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,510
I feel so bad.

496
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,490
Why did you move your
waist so much? I don't know.

497
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,570


498
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,410
Let me see your tongue.

499
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,800
You're moving your waist a lot.

500
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:20,560
You're scared. You're running away.

501
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,620
You're going to throw it away.

502
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,740
Did you want me to continue?

503
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,540
Hey, Kurata-san.

504
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
Can I control you? Please.

505
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520


506
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
Are you sure?

507
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,280
I'll do my best.

508
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,700
I'll do my best.

509
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,900
Be prepared.

510
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,260
Are you sure?

511
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:07,580
I don't know how long I can say that.

512
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,340
Ah, ah, ahh…

513
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,070
Ahh…

514
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:31,151
It's okay, I'll be nice
and gentle… Oh, I can't…

515
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,930
You can't, really?

516
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,030
Do you wanna confess your love?

517
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,950
No, no, I've never confession my love.

518
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,730
Oh, so I see.

519
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:43,765
Do you want to confess
your love to Seisaku-san?

520
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,650
No, it's not like that.

521
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,070
But you know,

522
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,910
we can't just say, ''Oh, I
didn't do that. Thank you.

523
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,830
'' We're not that stupid.

524
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,150
Right?

525
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,470
Right?

526
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,230
Don't go on your own.

527
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,130
We'll do whatever we want.

528
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,150
Are you sure?

529
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,670
Do you want me to do it?

530
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,210
Yes.

531
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,170
Oh, it's so sticky.

532
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,910
Are you saying you haven't
done it? No, I haven't.

533
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,750


534
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,110
Why are you saying that?

535
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
You have done it! I haven't.

536
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,850
It's hot.

537
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,390
Stop it.

538
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,350
It's so hot.

539
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,550


540
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,590
How long are you going to sleep?

541
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,870
Are you not going to tell me?

542
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,370
Masa, I really don't know anything.

543
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
You don't know anything?

544
00:35:21,255 --> 00:35:25,730
We are professionals.

545
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,350
We won't stop until we admit everything.

546
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,570
That's right.

547
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,710
Look.

548
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,070
Don't you say it yet?

549
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Even this?

550
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,810
Even this? Say it.

551
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,850


552
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,030
I haven't done it yet.

553
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,670
Why do you say such a thing?

554
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,490
Can't you say even this?

555
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:07,011
Don't you have anything to do with it?

556
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,290
Hey!

557
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,470
Is this OK?

558
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,750
What's wrong with you? It hurts.

559
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,690


560
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,070
Does it hurt?

561
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,990
Is this OK?

562
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,950
What's wrong with you?

563
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,090
Don't move around.

564
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,750
It's moving, so the cloak
will shift, won't it? Wait, this is.

565
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:55,890
..

566
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:56,891
Ai-chan!

567
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,770
You want to go, don't you?

568
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,710
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

569
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,510
I'll go, so...

570
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,270
If you want to go, say everything.

571
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Oh, it's hot.

572
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,280
Then, can I stay in the
hell forever? Oh, it's hot.

573
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100


574
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,520
Oh, it feels good.

575
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,260
Oh, it's hot.

576
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
He is quite patient.

577
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:42,450
Oh, it's the best.

578
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,510
Asumi-san.

579
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,190
Yes?

580
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,310
Let me examine you next.

581
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,610
Kurata-san, do you want to operate on me?

582
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,230
Yes.

583
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,850
Good.

584
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:08,590
This time, I'll operate on
you and make you spit it out.

585
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,150
You can't keep silent this
time, can you? I didn't do it.

586
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,110


587
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:18,050
What are you doing?

588
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,710
I'm not doing anything.

589
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,810
I'm really not doing anything.

590
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,230
Let's continue until I tell you the truth.

591
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,190
That's right.

592
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,930
These are the days of hell.

593
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,061
How much harder are
you in the same situation?

594
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,270
Hey.

595
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,910
It feels good, doesn't it?

596
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:45,190
Tell me the truth.

597
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:53,350
You feel good, you look alive, and
you committed a crime, didn't you?

598
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,410
I sold you, didn't I?

599
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,870
I sold you, didn't I? Tell me.

600
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,780
We don't want to blame you.
We just want to help you.

601
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,740
I didn't do anything.

602
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,520
We just give you a
chance to tell the truth.

603
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,120
You are so kind, aren't you?

604
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,660
I didn't do anything.

605
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,780
We give you a chance to confess.

606
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,320
We are so kind to you.

607
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:28,140
This is the first time I've ever
seen such a large number of babies.

608
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:37,420
Wow, look at the nipples.

609
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,400
Wow, look at the nipples.

610
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,160
Wow, look at the nipples.

611
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,420
What's going on?

612
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
What's going on?

613
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:00,740
I think I'm going to wake up.

614
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Wake up?

615
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,940
Are you going to wake up?

616
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
What?

617
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,060
Tell me everything before you wake up.

618
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,580
Come on.

619
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Oh, my neck.

620
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,460
What's wrong with you?

621
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,020
You feel good when I
touch you with my feet.

622
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,860
How about your ears?

623
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,940
Here?

624
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,600
Do you feel good?

625
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:42,800
Don't just focus on me.

626
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,180
I brought a stick.

627
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:49,301
Your back is getting better.

628
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,220
Your back is getting better.

629
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,440
You did it, didn't
you? No, I didn't.

630
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,821
What do you think?

631
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,960
You are such a bad liar!

632
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,700
You are about to show
your misdeeds, aren't you?

633
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,200
Do you think you can show your
misdeeds by doing bad things?

634
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:40,380
What are you doing?

635
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,680
I can't do it anymore.

636
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,300
If you can't do it, confess it.

637
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
I can't do it.

638
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,040
Come on.

639
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,600
I can't do it.

640
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Come on.

641
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Hey.

642
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
What?

643
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,520
He said he would go.

644
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:05,620
Why did you make him go?

645
00:43:05,621 --> 00:43:06,741
What the hell are you doing?

646
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,640
Did you say it?

647
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,640
I said it, didn't I?

648
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,760
What the hell are you doing?

649
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,560
Hey, you are drooling.

650
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,590
Don't do it.

651
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,190
You are eating ramen without permission.

652
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,090
You are the worst.

653
00:43:33,091 --> 00:43:34,091
This guy is so annoying.

654
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,810
Hey, can I continue? Please.

655
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,890


656
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,030
How selfish you are!

657
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,410
Who told you to serve noodles?

658
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,310
Sorry, I didn't know.

659
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,570
I told you to confess if you serve noodles.

660
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,610
No, I didn't.

661
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,310
And you let him in.

662
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,990
I just said it.

663
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,250
I'm sorry for making
you feel uncomfortable.

664
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,470
I don't know you just said it.

665
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,250
But, you are a pervert like you.

666
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,350
It's pretty good, isn't it?

667
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,450
As expected, it's a little bit of
blood, but it's a little bit of blood.

668
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,150
Why are you making it so hard?

669
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,470
I really can't do it.

670
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,050
I can't do it.

671
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,310
I can't do it.

672
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,370
I can't do it.

673
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,630
Hurry up and talk about everything.

674
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,110
It's going to be easier.

675
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,660
Hey!

676
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,150
Do you feel pain when I tighten
your neck like this? No, I don't.

677
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,760
No, I don't.

678
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Say it.

679
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620


680
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,910
You'll get drunk.

681
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:18,970
No, I don't.

682
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,540
You'll become self-absorbed.

683
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,210
No, I don't.

684
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,170
I can't go any further.

685
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,910
Why not?

686
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,310
You just have to say it.

687
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:37,670
What?

688
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:39,570
What? You're not going to say it yet?

689
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,790
Like this? Is this how you do it?

690
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:48,960
What? Are you going to say it?
Are you going to say it?

691
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:50,466
Are you going to say it?
Are you going to say it?

692
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,611
I think I'm going to say it.

693
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,400
Say it before you take it off.

694
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,020
I can't. I can't.

695
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,580
Let me help you up.

696
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,540
Come on.

697
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:17,020
I'm up.

698
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,980
It's time for you to get up.

699
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,740
Oh my...

700
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,660
You're so clingy.

701
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Here it comes.

702
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:58,820
How many noodles did you eat in the end?

703
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,880
I didn't eat any.

704
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,860
I didn't say anything to you,
but you did it on your own.

705
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,160
I can't sleep at all.

706
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,420
You did it.

707
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,730
It's hard.

708
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,900
You really didn't let me sleep with her.

709
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,190
She was lying.

710
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,480
I'm not lying.

711
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,640
I can't do it anymore.

712
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,560
That's enough.

713
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,701
That's all for today's interrogation.

714
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:34,880
What?

715
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,860
Today's interrogation?

716
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,351
Do you think it's over today?

717
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,260
Can I go home?

718
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,940
I'll continue until you say so.

719
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,720
Do you think you can go home?

720
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,360
I really didn't do it.

721
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,300
Please let me go home.

722
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,130
That's all for today.

723
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,000
If you run into me again,

724
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,740
Think about how to confess properly.

725
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,440
I really didn't do it.

726
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:33,340
It seems to be already boneless.

727
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,180
It's a pervert.

728
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
What? She came.

729
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,720
She looks kind.

730
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,361
You look like a good boy.

731
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,160
Don't you think it's bad to betray
such a good boy? I didn't do it.

732
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,660


733
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,640
What is this? Don't go.

734
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,510
This is.

735
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,410
..

736
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,610
Come on, stand up.

737
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,190
Come on, hurry up.

738
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,760
I'm sure it's a mistake.

739
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,660
Yes, I really don't know anything.

740
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,080
I believe you.

741
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,920
I'm really sorry to worry you.

742
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,480
Sake-kun, what do you want to eat when
you come back? I'll make anything for you.

743
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,920
Oh, I see. What should I make?

744
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,860
Oh, I guess I'll make grilled ginger.

745
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,200
Oh, grilled ginger.

746
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,680
You can make a lot of grilled ginger.

747
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,760
You can make something more expensive.

748
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,540
Well, I like grilled ginger.

749
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:38,040
You really like grilled
ginger, don't you, Take-kun?

750
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:38,780
Yes.

751
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:45,500
Well, I'll make a delicious grilled
ginger for you, so please come out soon.

752
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,140
No, I don't think I can come out soon.

753
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,740
That's right.
I really think this is a mistake.

754
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,680
Maybe you'll come out tomorrow.

755
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,600
I hope so.

756
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,411
I was really surprised when I got a
call from Take-kun's father and mother.

757
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,100
I see. I'm really sorry, Take-kun.

758
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:19,820
We were worried about you, too,
but I'll tell you what happened today.

759
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,740
It's all right.

760
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
Oh, really?

761
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,310
Don't look so anxious.

762
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,840
I just think I can go out soon.

763
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,300
But let's go somewhere far
away to play when you graduate.

764
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,230
Where do you want to go?

765
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,860
You said you wanted to
go to the museum, right?

766
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:59,323
I heard that there is a big
exhibition of dinosaurs now,

767
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:04,460
and it will be over in a
week, so let's go until then.

768
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,340
You don't have a cool face.

769
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,680
Yeah, that's right.

770
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,701
Hey, aren't you in
a daze? Yes, I am.

771
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,500


772
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:22,840
But I'm in such a state, so I'm upset.

773
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,551
But I'm glad to see your happy face.

774
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,280
I can't lock you up in a place like this.

775
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,460
You're right.

776
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,880
I'm worried about you.

777
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,380
I feel weak.

778
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:46,100
It's natural, isn't it?
To be suddenly arrested and imprisoned.

779
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,460
But if it's Take-kun, it's okay.

780
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,900
Because Take-kun is a sincere person.

781
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,480
He never makes a mistake as a person.

782
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,860
Take-kun is such a person.

783
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,160
Oh, I see.

784
00:53:06,161 --> 00:53:15,900
I love your sincerity and
kindness, so I believe in you.

785
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:28,560
I'm sure I'll pick you up when you
go to work, so I'll dress up for you.

786
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,640
Maybe I can go to Astania,
so I'll prepare a lot for you.

787
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,380
Yeah, if you do that, I'll be saved.

788
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,775
You may not be able to
sleep at night in a place

789
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:50,240
like this, but do your
best and trust yourself.

790
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:54,920
I'm waiting for you, too.

791
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:55,921
I'm waiting for you.

792
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,880
It's time to finish the meeting.

793
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:06,420
I see.

794
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,080
I'm going to bed.

795
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:15,120
Bye-bye.

796
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
Let's go.

797
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:35,930
What a thrill.

798
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,190
What are you trying to do?

799
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,110
She is a good girl.

800
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,510
She is a good girl.

801
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:46,430
You didn't listen to me at all.

802
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:53,910
You don't know when I will come back.

803
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,610
Look at me carefully.

804
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:13,090
Now you can concentrate.

805
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,850
I'm concentrating.

806
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:16,851
It's hard, isn't it?

807
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,250
It's hard, isn't it?

808
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,880
Look, I'm appealing to you.

809
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,300
You like it, don't you?

810
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,820
Stand up and look at me.

811
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,080
Don't move your legs.

812
00:55:57,081 --> 00:55:59,780
Don't look at her. Look at her carefully.

813
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,040
I'll look at her.

814
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,080
You're pushing her boobs. Open your eyes.

815
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,040
You have to look at her. Look at her.

816
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Closer.

817
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,360
You're so nice.

818
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,100
You're so mean.

819
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,580
Look, look, look.

820
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,410
This is it.

821
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,060
Touch it.

822
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,260
Do you want me to tickle you?

823
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,600
It makes you feel good, doesn't it?

824
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,920
I really didn't do it.

825
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:44,340
Hey, look at me.

826
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:52,200
You were talking to your girlfriend
until a while ago, weren't you?

827
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,180
You were over there, weren't you?

828
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,340
What are you doing now?

829
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,520
Look at your face.

830
00:57:02,521 --> 00:57:03,620
Look at her face.

831
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:14,260
That's right.

832
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,720
Look at her lips.

833
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:30,900
What a nasty lips.

834
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,240
Look at me closer.

835
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,760
Closer.

836
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,900
I'm looking at you.

837
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,020
Are you sincere?

838
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,140
I heard you are sincere.

839
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,640
What's the matter?

840
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:02,680
No, you don't have to do that.

841
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,060
Look, look.

842
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,220
Wow, wow.

843
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,300
Look at this.

844
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,820
Nami is honest.

845
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,940
You're right.

846
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,620
Nami is honest to a woman's body.

847
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,840
She's honest to stimulation.

848
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:26,120
Hey, you did it,
didn't you? I didn't.

849
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:27,520


850
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,460
Look at your butt.
It's disgusting, isn't it?

851
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:36,240
I want to meet my girlfriend.
I didn't do such a thing.

852
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,560
You met your girlfriend.

853
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:43,760
You met your kind
girlfriend who believes in you.

854
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,580
Your nipples are so tight.

855
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Yes.

856
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,820
Hey, aren't you stressed out by us
being bullied like this? No, I'm not.

857
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:17,800


858
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,260
I think it's better to
confess as soon as possible.

859
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,640
I haven't confessed yet.

860
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,280
If you hide the truth like
this, it's bad for your health.

861
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,080
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.

862
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,440
I didn't know you were so weak.

863
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:40,876
You were always so strong.

864
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,360
You said you believed in her so much.

865
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,060
What do you believe in? Your good standing?

866
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,120
You've been betraying me in front of me.

867
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:57,500
I was told that I was not stupid.

868
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,380
I was.

869
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,580
I'm not really a villain.

870
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,740
Or maybe I'm a conman.

871
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,360
You're actually a villain, aren't you?

872
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

873
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,220
I see. You're fooling a cute girl like her.

874
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,060
I'm not fooling her.

875
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,720
I didn't know you could be such a bad guy.

876
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,720
You scared me.

877
01:00:46,715 --> 01:00:47,880
You found out, didn't you?

878
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,760
What do you mean?

879
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,380
I think you didn't notice it
because I put ice cream on it.

880
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:00,700
How can I explain this?

881
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:08,880
This thickness, this
hardness, this sensitivity.

882
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:09,881
It's so good.

883
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:22,000
I was spoken by me a lot under the chair.

884
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,230
It's so bad.

885
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,530
There is no trace of honesty.

886
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,530
Who is being honest?

887
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,881
You should get rid of it soon.

888
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,350
Oh, you are drooling.

889
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,290
Oh, you are sleepy.

890
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,410
You are more honest than me.

891
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:06,530
You are right.

892
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,790
Honesty to stimulation.

893
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:18,030
You haven't done it, have you?

894
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,970
I wonder how long it will work.

895
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,405
I hope it's not through the board.

896
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:38,780
Ochinpo.

897
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:51,980
Oh, you were so worried
about her coming to the visit.

898
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,400
I didn't do anything.

899
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,220
You did.

900
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,420
I didn't.

901
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:06,216
If she was really important to you, you
wouldn't have gone back on your word.

902
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,540
You only know how to lie.

903
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,940
I didn't.

904
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,200
Didn't you tell her?

905
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,080
A liar is the beginning of a thief.

906
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,080
Did I really do that?

907
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,640
That's a lie, isn't
it? No, I didn't.

908
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:18,820


909
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,960
Really?

910
01:03:20,355 --> 01:03:21,800
Did you tell the
truth? No, I didn't.

911
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,860


912
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,960
You're stubborn, aren't you?

913
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,140
Keep doing that.

914
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,820
Have a seat.

915
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:35,821
What are you doing?

916
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:49,050
You haven't done
anything, have you? Oh, no.

917
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,900


918
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,240
The tip of this chimpanzee seems to be wet.

919
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:05,970
What's this? I don't know.

920
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:10,475
It's wet.

921
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,900


922
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,840
Look, the hole is shaking.

923
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,100
It's embarrassing.

924
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,660
For example, until you confess,

925
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,860
you can't keep drinking.

926
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,660
That's hell, isn't it?

927
01:04:40,661 --> 01:04:41,661
What's wrong with
you? I don't know.

928
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,860


929
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,560
What's wrong with
you? I don't know.

930
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,700


931
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,780
He may become a fool.

932
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,740
He may lose his senses.

933
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:09,510
He is so full of energy.

934
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:19,190
You like boobs, don't you? You were looking
at Kurata-san's boobs a lot, weren't you?

935
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,530
Look at his boobs. Thank him.

936
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,250
Pat him.

937
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,350
You did it, didn't you? Say it.

938
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,010
What?

939
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:37,070
You don't say anything?

940
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:39,970
No.

941
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:40,850
No.

942
01:05:40,851 --> 01:05:41,851
You don't say
anything? I didn't do it.

943
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,630


944
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,610
Really? I didn't do it.

945
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,530


946
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,190
I really didn't do it.

947
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,450
I knew it.

948
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,390
Are you going to keep lying like that?

949
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,030
Where is the sincerity?

950
01:06:02,031 --> 01:06:03,031
It's hot, isn't it?

951
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,610
Open your mouth.

952
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:26,070
Here you are, Gochan.

953
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,910
How do you feel?

954
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:35,230
I'll rub the remaining saliva on your face.

955
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,710
It feels good, doesn't it?

956
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:41,890
How do you feel?

957
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,650
Do you want to go?

958
01:06:47,785 --> 01:06:52,250
If you let out your genitals,
I have to say, No, I didn't.

959
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:53,770
Hold on.

960
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:54,210
No, I didn't.

961
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,270
Hold on.

962
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,370
No, I didn't.

963
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:56,910
Hold on.

964
01:06:56,911 --> 01:06:57,350
No, I didn't.

965
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:57,990
Hold on.

966
01:06:57,991 --> 01:06:58,070
No, I didn't.

967
01:06:58,071 --> 01:06:58,270
Hold on.

968
01:06:58,271 --> 01:06:58,430
No, I didn't.

969
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,030
Hold on.

970
01:07:00,031 --> 01:07:00,410
No, I didn't.

971
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:01,190
No, I didn't.

972
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,350
Hold on.

973
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:03,390
No, I didn't.

974
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:04,391
Hold on.

975
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,210
No, I didn't.

976
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:05,690
Hold on.

977
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:05,830
No, I didn't.

978
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,110
Hold on.

979
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:08,350
No, I didn't.

980
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:10,630
No, I didn't.

981
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:17,350
No, I didn't.

982
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:22,050
Hold on.

983
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:22,230
That's right.

984
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:24,190
You should be grateful.

985
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,150
I didn't do anything.

986
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:29,190
You're such a good boy.

987
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:33,330
If it were true, I wouldn't
take so much time for you.

988
01:07:36,915 --> 01:07:40,490
Do you know how much
you are blessed? I don't know.

989
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,290


990
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,521
I'm sure you've heard that.

991
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:48,590
I didn't do anything.

992
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:49,591
I'm not doing it.

993
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:54,130
I'm not doing it.

994
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,910
I'm not doing it.

995
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:07,190
I don't understand what you are saying.

996
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,570
I'm not doing it.

997
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,930
You look happy.

998
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:13,931
That's right.

999
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,850
Do you want me to help you?

1000
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:20,130
Do you want me to help you?

1001
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:21,211
Do you want me to help you?

1002
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,610
Do you want me to help you?

1003
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:23,050
Do you want me to help you?

1004
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:24,132
Do you want me to help you?

1005
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,270
Do you want me to help you?

1006
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,352
Do you want me to help you?

1007
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,790
Do you want me to help you?

1008
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,051
Do you want me to help you?

1009
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,930
Do you want me to help you?

1010
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,420
Put strength in your muscles.

1011
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,700
Your muscles are getting bigger.

1012
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,000
Your buttocks are hot.

1013
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:14,140
You are doing this, but
you are still not doing it.

1014
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,360
How serious are you?

1015
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:19,920
I really didn't do it.
I don't know anything.

1016
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:23,620
How long are you going to keep saying that?

1017
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:42,660
It's coming out little by little.

1018
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,420
You came to admit your crime, didn't you?

1019
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,580
Or what?

1020
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,440
Do you want to take off
your stocking with your butt?

1021
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,000
Come on!

1022
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:16,460
Did you take it off?

1023
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,480
Safe!

1024
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,470
You are so fast.

1025
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,490
※This is not a sound effect.

1026
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:32,910
※This is not a sound effect.

1027
01:11:32,911 --> 01:11:32,990
※This is not a sound effect.

1028
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:33,991
Did you do it? No, I didn't.

1029
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,810


1030
01:11:37,985 --> 01:11:39,030
It's not over yet.

1031
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,170
No, I didn't.

1032
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,230
Did you make a
deal? No, I didn't.

1033
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,610


1034
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:45,430
You did, didn't
you? No, I didn't.

1035
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,430


1036
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:49,850
You're a good boy.

1037
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,070
So, you admit it,
don't you? I'm sorry.

1038
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,070


1039
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,550
Take off your panties.

1040
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:11,080
I'll make you feel pain again.

1041
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,700
Show me all of your embarrassing parts.

1042
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,020
Come on.

1043
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:22,300
Support yourself.

1044
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,860
Oh, you are Marumi Eda.

1045
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,220
I'm embarrassed.

1046
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,540
Really?

1047
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,648
Do you intend not to
say anything even though

1048
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,480
you are wearing such an
embarrassing costume?

1049
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,120
Is this okay?

1050
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,280
Do you want to try to spit it out?

1051
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,060
It will be on your face.

1052
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,980
Oh, it will be on your face.

1053
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,540
Do you want to spit it out?

1054
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,900
You did it, didn't
you? No, I didn't.

1055
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,820


1056
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,720
How do you feel?

1057
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,540
Do you want to return it?

1058
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,460
You didn't want to return it, did you?

1059
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,800
What should I do?

1060
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,940
Do you want to
return it? No, I don't.

1061
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,340
Okay, then.

1062
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:06,420


1063
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,280
Let me know when you want to return it.

1064
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,940
No, I don't.

1065
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,380
Come on.

1066
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,560
No, I don't.

1067
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,720
Do you want to
return it? No, I don't.

1068
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,441
Do you want to go? No, I don't.

1069
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:17,720
No, I don't.

1070
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:18,721


1071
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,320
Oh, you don't like the safe?

1072
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,370
You were about to take it out?

1073
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,300
I told you you can take it out now.

1074
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,040
That's right.

1075
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,460
Wow, wow.

1076
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,520
You still don't want to take it out?

1077
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:50,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

1078
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,060
It's tickling.

1079
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:11,500
It must be painful.

1080
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:16,000
If you are in pain, just let it go.

1081
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,560
There is nothing good
if you keep the truth.

1082
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,980
If you don't say it, I'll keep doing it.

1083
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,380
What are you going to do?

1084
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,660
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

1085
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,660
I haven't done it yet.

1086
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,260
You are so stubborn.

1087
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,860
I got it.

1088
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:53,680
I'll punish you again today.

1089
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,400
Punish me?

1090
01:14:55,401 --> 01:14:57,180
Keep yourself in a state of tingling.

1091
01:14:57,181 --> 01:14:58,341
Can you hold it for a moment?

1092
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,200
You are happy, aren't you?

1093
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,220
There is nothing to be so happy about.

1094
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,280
It hurts, doesn't it?

1095
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,660
I didn't know you had such a big finger.

1096
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,281
Have you ever been in
this state? No, I haven't.

1097
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,360


1098
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,680
No, you haven't.

1099
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:33,820
No, you haven't.

1100
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,160
No, you haven't.

1101
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,400
No, you haven't.

1102
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,080
No, you haven't.

1103
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:43,120
No, you haven't.

1104
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,140
No, you haven't.

1105
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:46,420
No, you haven't.

1106
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,940
No, you haven't.

1107
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,940
No, you haven't.

1108
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,600
No, you haven't.

1109
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,080
No, you haven't.

1110
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,720
I'm sure you'll be able to remember it.

1111
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,150
It feels so good.

1112
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,480
He looks like he's having fun.

1113
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,220
I don't think he's just having sex.

1114
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,860
That's why you don't say anything?

1115
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,120
I'm going to sleep.

1116
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,540
If you don't talk much,
you'll get in trouble.

1117
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:22,940
I know that.

1118
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,580
This is the first time
I've seen a cat like this.

1119
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:31,800
He's so cute.

1120
01:16:31,801 --> 01:16:33,520
Oh, he's so cute.

1121
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:34,760
He's so cute.

1122
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:35,761
He's so cute.

1123
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:44,760
He's so cute.

1124
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,240
He's so cute.

1125
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,380
He's so cute.

1126
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,920
You only say you didn't do it, don't you?

1127
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:02,960
I really didn't do it.

1128
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,520
You have no excuse
other than that, don't you?

1129
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,760
You have an alibi,
don't you? I don't know.

1130
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:11,360


1131
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:16,580
You can't prove your innocence, can you?

1132
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,900
If you say you didn't
do it, prove it yourself.

1133
01:17:21,901 --> 01:17:23,120
Yes, you are right.

1134
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,820
Please convince us.

1135
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,560
But you can't, can you?

1136
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,800
You are doing it, aren't you?

1137
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,600
Oh, it came off.

1138
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,260
Because you move too much.

1139
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,600
So?

1140
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:49,500
Do you feel better?

1141
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:50,501
How did it go? I don't know.

1142
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,760


1143
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,480
You don't know?

1144
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,531
This is the only thing he says.

1145
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,720
I really don't know.

1146
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,740
Did someone tell you to do so?

1147
01:18:03,885 --> 01:18:05,200
No, it's not like that.

1148
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,680
That kind of instruction?

1149
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,480
No, it's not that kind of instruction.

1150
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,980
Then I have an idea.

1151
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,380
Idea?

1152
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,100
You don't want to say it, do you?

1153
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,270
You don't want to say it, do you?

1154
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,080
You don't want to say it, do you?

1155
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,660
You don't want to say it, do you?

1156
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,806
What are you going to do?
Are you going to leave it as it is?

1157
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,600
Are you going to leave it as
it is without doing anything?

1158
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,880
Are you going to leave it as
it is without doing anything?

1159
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:38,960
Are you going to leave it as
it is without doing anything?

1160
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:43,080
You are hungry, aren't you?

1161
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:15,214
Let us keep Chimpanzees
free as long as we

1162
01:19:15,226 --> 01:19:23,740
are in a tree and as
long as we are hereover.

1163
01:19:23,741 --> 01:19:24,741
You're free, aren't you?

1164
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,340
I'll let you use your freedom.

1165
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,200
You don't have any freedom.

1166
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:34,201
Ouch!

1167
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:58,930
Do you still want to open
the castle in this situation?

1168
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:00,990
I don't want to.

1169
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,490
Do you feel dizzy?

1170
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:12,130
You are sincere, aren't you?

1171
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,490
Tell me the truth.

1172
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:16,740
I don't know.

1173
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:22,450
You didn't tell me.

1174
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,650
I didn't tell you, so I don't know.

1175
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:28,850
You don't know?

1176
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:33,710
Then,

1177
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:38,330
I wonder if I should ask
you to move once in a while.

1178
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:45,130
You're the only one who's
feeling better, aren't you?

1179
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,730
Come on, get up.

1180
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:56,450
Are you cold?

1181
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,110
Come on, put your hands on me.

1182
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,110
Or maybe you don't know where you are?

1183
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:04,670
Have you never done anything like this?

1184
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,670
Ah.

1185
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,150
Move your body.

1186
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,110
Why are you
silent? I'm doing it.

1187
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:17,750


1188
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,130
Like this, right?
Move your body.

1189
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,230
Good.

1190
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,490


1191
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,200
I'm not doing it.

1192
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:24,650
Ah.

1193
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:25,770
Ah.

1194
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:26,190
Great.

1195
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,410
I'm not doing it.

1196
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:28,411
You're not doing it?

1197
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:29,610
I'm not doing it.

1198
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,410
But, I see.

1199
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:37,830
Your face and name are
on the list of people involved.

1200
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,530
What do you mean?

1201
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:43,610
Are you still going to investigate?

1202
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:45,830
Investigate?

1203
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,630
Don't be stupid.

1204
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,110
That bridge is a good place for a deal.

1205
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:56,231
This is your favorite place.

1206
01:21:56,510 --> 01:22:01,130
You don't have to be
there at such a good timing.

1207
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:16,190
You are moving,
aren't you? Let's do it.

1208
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:16,870
Let's do it.

1209
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,230


1210
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,650
Move your waist.

1211
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,010
I'm tired.

1212
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,130
It's OK.

1213
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:37,360
I'm going to die.

1214
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,460
I didn't ask you to stop.

1215
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,000
Who said you could stop?

1216
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:05,460
What?

1217
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,560
Hey!

1218
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,060
Who said you could stop?

1219
01:23:09,061 --> 01:23:09,380
What did you say?

1220
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,900
I almost said it.

1221
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,680
You almost said it?

1222
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,060
Do everything as I say.

1223
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,780
Come on, move!

1224
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,840
I told you not to laugh.

1225
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:35,670
Hey!

1226
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:37,930
You are missing.

1227
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:40,770
Down, down, down.

1228
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,220
Go, go, go.

1229
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,540
Let me go.

1230
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:58,180
Let me go.

1231
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:28,670
She's coming out.

1232
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:33,970
She's coming out again.

1233
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:35,630
It's great.

1234
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,410
It's the best.

1235
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,650
Look at her.

1236
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:44,730
It's not over yet.

1237
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,930
Look at her.

1238
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,590
She's getting ready.

1239
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,690
Are you ready to go to bed?

1240
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:00,390
Are you ready?

1241
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:02,870
I think you can do it.

1242
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:04,750
It's perfect, isn't it?

1243
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:10,430
Yes.

1244
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:15,660
Put it in your mouth.

1245
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:21,470
Don't be nervous.

1246
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:28,370
Wow.

1247
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,930
It's in your chest.

1248
01:25:40,905 --> 01:25:41,905
Does it feel good?

1249
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,910
Does it feel good to be
tied up with a manko?

1250
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:48,770
I want to do it over and over again.

1251
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:50,630
Over and over again?

1252
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:51,670
It's easy, isn't it?

1253
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,990
If it's a confession, it's over and over
again, so does it feel good? It's painful.

1254
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:56,390


1255
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:57,550
Is it painful?

1256
01:25:57,551 --> 01:26:04,090
It's painful? Then confess it.
It's painful, isn't it? I didn't do it.

1257
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,700
I'll tell you.

1258
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:14,050
It's painful. You've been
attacked. That's why it's painful.

1259
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:18,270
Move yourself.

1260
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:26,550
Can you do it?

1261
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,880
Move your waist.

1262
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,270
Move your waist.

1263
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:34,560
Yes, yes, yes.

1264
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,850
You can do it.

1265
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:37,670
I'll hold your waist like this.

1266
01:26:37,671 --> 01:26:38,951
I'm going to give you a massage.

1267
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:41,690
Give me a good massage.

1268
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:47,210
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1269
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,110
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1270
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:51,470
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1271
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:54,410
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1272
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:56,150
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1273
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,390
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1274
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:01,010
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1275
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:06,150
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1276
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:06,190
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1277
01:27:06,215 --> 01:27:07,695
I'm going to give you a good massage.

1278
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:13,190
I'll support you.

1279
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,430
Like this, right?

1280
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:19,090
I'll support you.

1281
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:26,810
More, more, more, more, more, more, more.

1282
01:27:29,325 --> 01:27:32,630
It sounds good, but if you hit
your butt, you'll break your back.

1283
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:40,640
Oh, it's painful.

1284
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:42,420
Get out of the way.

1285
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,900
I'm on your back.

1286
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:49,460
I want to go home.

1287
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,620
Don't stop your back.

1288
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,720
Don't do it on your own.

1289
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:40,420
Oh, you are so naughty.

1290
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,780
Come on, rub your belly.

1291
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,780
Good boy.

1292
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,180
Show me your belly more.

1293
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:53,980
Show me your tongue.

1294
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,540
Yes, yes, yes.

1295
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,140
I can see it well.

1296
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,420
Oh, you are so naughty.

1297
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:01,520
Come on, come on.

1298
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,680
Use your waist.

1299
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:12,960
What? Is she also acting cute like this?

1300
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,840
Don't do it on your own this time.

1301
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,110
Come on, come on, come on.

1302
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Harder.

1303
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,140
Good sound.

1304
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,680
Good sound.

1305
01:29:30,085 --> 01:29:31,680
I can hear a good sound here.

1306
01:29:38,490 --> 01:30:00,960
I'm glad you didn't go to the hospital.

1307
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:09,640
It's not the end yet.

1308
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,160
It's not the end yet.

1309
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,720
What do you mean?

1310
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,720
Don't put it from behind your hip.

1311
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,120
It's a scab, isn't it? Hurry up.

1312
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,320
Put it in.

1313
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:35,690
Put it in.

1314
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,680
What are you waiting
for? Do it yourself.

1315
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:39,720
I don't know.

1316
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,240


1317
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,440
Are you just doing it?

1318
01:30:44,441 --> 01:30:50,060
Do you always do this? You
can do it, can't you? I don't do it.

1319
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,440


1320
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:04,300
You don't do it. You don't do it.
I'm tired of hearing that line.

1321
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,360
I don't do it. I don't do it.

1322
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:09,980
Can't you hear a different line?

1323
01:31:09,981 --> 01:31:10,981
Can't you hear me?

1324
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,680
I can't hear you.

1325
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,920
Use your waist.

1326
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,960
Come on.

1327
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,640
More.

1328
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:25,780
Good.

1329
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:28,040
Good.

1330
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,041
Good.

1331
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,240
Shiro, Shiro, Shiro, Shiro.

1332
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,700
Why are you taking a break?

1333
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:10,660
Hey, move, move.

1334
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,300
What are you doing? Aren't you tired?

1335
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,360
Why are you saying
that? Come here.

1336
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,420


1337
01:32:45,365 --> 01:32:47,980
Why do you think you can be forgiven?

1338
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,040
You still have a long way to go.

1339
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,300
Still?

1340
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,800
Now that you've seen it,
it's your turn to move, isn't it?

1341
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:03,040
Will you let it end?

1342
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:04,980
Let it end?

1343
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,680
What?

1344
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,240
What do you want to end?

1345
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,980
What?

1346
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,840
What do you want
to end? Hey, hey.

1347
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,440


1348
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:18,180
Do you want to confess
and end this interrogation?

1349
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,520
Confess?

1350
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,980
I want to end this interrogation.

1351
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:26,660
Do you want to give up
and finish with this? It's OK.

1352
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,480


1353
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,400
You look like you feel good.

1354
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,740
You look like you feel good.

1355
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,520
He is noisy, though.

1356
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,660
It looks dangerous.

1357
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:56,860
Open your eyes.

1358
01:33:56,861 --> 01:33:57,861
A little girl cries.

1359
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:14,090
Are you done?

1360
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:16,090
It's not the end.

1361
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,770
Please forgive me.

1362
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,890
It's painful, isn't it?

1363
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:23,970
Then, don't say the same
thing as me, ok? Go on.

1364
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:25,770


1365
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:28,210
I…

1366
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:30,050
You know, I

1367
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,270
I … I committed a drug offence.

1368
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,510
I committed a drug offence.

1369
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:37,890
I committed it.

1370
01:34:38,015 --> 01:34:40,910
No, I didn't do that.

1371
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:47,450
Open your mouth.

1372
01:34:51,205 --> 01:34:56,310
He doesn't say anything.

1373
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:59,250
Amazing.

1374
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:02,230
He likes to give us a hard time.

1375
01:35:02,231 --> 01:35:03,350
You like it, don't you?

1376
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,990
Tell me the truth.

1377
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:17,030
Not yet?

1378
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,030
I really didn't do it.

1379
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:21,310
Really?

1380
01:35:21,311 --> 01:35:22,311
Did you really
do it? I didn't do it.

1381
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,500
Really? Really.

1382
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:25,150


1383
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,110


1384
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:27,470
Really?

1385
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,370
Did you do it? I did.

1386
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:31,130


1387
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:36,290
You can't do it anymore.

1388
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,170
You're crazy.

1389
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,930
It's terrible if you lie.

1390
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,530
I'm not lying.

1391
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,340
Say it.

1392
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,440
Don't you do it? I do.

1393
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,280


1394
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,520
You do, don't you? No, I don't.

1395
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,620
You do, don't you?

1396
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:10,600
I want you to hold me tight.

1397
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,360
I won't stop until you admit it.

1398
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,280
I haven't done it since this morning.

1399
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,240
What are you talking about?

1400
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:48,100
What's wrong with you?

1401
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,100
Are you out of your mind?

1402
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:55,790
Are you kidding me?

1403
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:59,030
You are good at doing whatever you want.

1404
01:36:59,031 --> 01:37:01,770
I thought it would last a little longer.

1405
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:05,190
Wow, it's coming out a lot.

1406
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:08,130
It's all muddy.

1407
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,070
I thought it came out all yesterday.

1408
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:15,630
That's true.

1409
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:17,110
It's coming out so much in a day.

1410
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:18,650
It's dripping a lot.

1411
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:21,990
It's coming out a lot.

1412
01:37:21,991 --> 01:37:22,991
It's dirty.

1413
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,490
Why don't you
take it out? It's dirty.

1414
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,010


1415
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:36,570
Isn't it your job to clean up dirty things?

1416
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,500
Isn't it? Clean it up.

1417
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:50,110


1418
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,870
I'm going to put my blanket here.

1419
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:00,130
I'm going to make it clean, too.

1420
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:03,150
Lick it, lick it.

1421
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:06,750
Me, too.

1422
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,050
Lick it, lick it.

1423
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,290
Siro, lick it.

1424
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:21,510
It doesn't move at all.

1425
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,000
Is it delicious? I'm so sorry.

1426
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,320
I got dirty.

1427
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,020


1428
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,340
He is more stubborn than I thought.

1429
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:43,180
He is a villain.

1430
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,020
We have to be serious.

1431
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:50,860
See you tomorrow.

1432
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:55,620
I'll take good care of you.

1433
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:58,720
Please forgive me.

1434
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:03,340
Be quiet.

1435
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,540
Other people will wake up.

1436
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:09,560
You were careless.

1437
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,281
Did you think you'd be
able to sleep at night?

1438
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,101
You said you'd come back tomorrow.

1439
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,640
But unfortunately, you're here.

1440
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:28,000
It's not over until you tell me the truth.

1441
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,080
It's a continuation of the investigation.

1442
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:39,650
You're already reacting, aren't you?

1443
01:40:40,675 --> 01:40:43,310
Did you want to dream
about what you did today?

1444
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:56,750
You're really making me nervous.

1445
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:14,211
You're saying amazing things.

1446
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:19,530
What?

1447
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:22,410
You can't do that now.

1448
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,151
You don't want to come out anymore?

1449
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,070
Does it feel good?

1450
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,210
You're more honest than I thought.

1451
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:43,530
I know.

1452
01:41:47,555 --> 01:41:49,250
I'm still investigating.

1453
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:50,731
We're in the middle of it, aren't we?

1454
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,140
It's time for bed.

1455
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:05,680
So what are you hiding?

1456
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:07,340
Get out of my way.

1457
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,820
You've already grown up.

1458
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:17,140
Did you dream about us?

1459
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:20,660
Are you happy?

1460
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:32,600
You want me to pinch you, don't you?

1461
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:34,620
Then, please do it like that.

1462
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,500
I committed a crime.

1463
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,380
So...

1464
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:45,650
Pinch me.

1465
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,900
Please do it comfortably.

1466
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,820
Don't do that.

1467
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:54,430
I'll hold you.

1468
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,920
It feels good to be petted,
doesn't it? Wow, wow.

1469
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,500


1470
01:43:01,605 --> 01:43:02,646
Do you want me to pet you?

1471
01:43:08,025 --> 01:43:10,240
It's hard to stay like this, isn't it?

1472
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,320
You want to be comfortable, don't you?

1473
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:19,740
You can't sleep in a
house like this, can you?

1474
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:25,980
You can't sleep in a
house like this, can you?

1475
01:43:27,045 --> 01:43:31,580
Well, I'll let you out, so be honest.

1476
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:34,740
That's right.

1477
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,940
Does it feel good?

1478
01:43:56,785 --> 01:44:05,530
Do you think you can
live in a house like this?

1479
01:44:10,205 --> 01:44:11,566
Why do you have such a bad breath?

1480
01:44:11,670 --> 01:44:12,670
Don't you think so?

1481
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:14,530
Do you want me to do more?

1482
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:22,270
Can you stand it?

1483
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:28,330
It's bad that you don't talk.

1484
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:53,640
You seem to be in a hurry to go home.

1485
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:54,960
That's right.

1486
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,580
It hurts, doesn't it?

1487
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:31,780
Not yet?

1488
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:35,640
It hurts, doesn't
it? It looks fun.

1489
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:41,660
I want to do it, too.

1490
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:44,740
Go ahead.

1491
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:49,940
Come on.

1492
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,700
You want to be refreshed, don't you?

1493
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,980
You're tired, aren't you? You want
to sleep, don't you? Say it quickly.

1494
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:03,940
It's so heavy.

1495
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:06,220


1496
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:11,020
Do you know what's left?

1497
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:13,791
Do you want me to scratch it?

1498
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:26,910
You don't think I'll forgive
you, do you? You did it.

1499
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:29,830


1500
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,700
Tell me the truth.

1501
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:37,790
Do you want this?

1502
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,410
Raise your hips.

1503
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:42,870
Come on.

1504
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:53,270
You look so good.

1505
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:57,900
Do you feel good?

1506
01:46:58,930 --> 01:46:59,770
Do you like this?

1507
01:46:59,771 --> 01:47:02,150
Do you like boobs?

1508
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:06,980
You're shaking your hips.

1509
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:16,300
Look, it hurts.

1510
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:21,340
It hurts, doesn't it?

1511
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:22,780
Don't you know which one it is?

1512
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:25,380
Mental illness?

1513
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,600
Self-harm?

1514
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:29,820
It doesn't matter.

1515
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:37,900
But we are waiting for your confession.

1516
01:47:41,715 --> 01:47:43,060
Go with Seishizawa-san.

1517
01:47:55,955 --> 01:47:57,236
Do you want me to rub your butt?

1518
01:48:02,575 --> 01:48:03,920
You like butt, don't
you? Oh, it tickles.

1519
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:06,740
It tickles.

1520
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,940
Let me do it, too.

1521
01:48:16,155 --> 01:48:17,360
It tickles, doesn't
it? It tickles.

1522
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,140
Oh, it tickles.

1523
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,580
Oh, it tickles.

1524
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,110
It tickles.

1525
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:31,710
It's very hard.

1526
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:36,210


1527
01:48:37,485 --> 01:48:45,810
Hey, you want to feel
good, don't you? Then, do it.

1528
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:54,730


1529
01:48:56,425 --> 01:48:57,510
Did you do it?

1530
01:48:58,750 --> 01:48:59,750
Didn't you do it?

1531
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:04,050
Are you going to get up again?

1532
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:09,570
It can't be helped, can it?

1533
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:17,130
Yattan, we have our own
ideas, don't we? Say it.

1534
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,560
Say it.

1535
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,560
Say it.

1536
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,510
Say it.

1537
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:40,550
You did it, didn't you?

1538
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:44,710
Take it off while I'm being nice.

1539
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:48,570
You can't sleep forever.

1540
01:49:50,405 --> 01:49:51,405
We can sleep all night.

1541
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,870
Wow, your back.

1542
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:06,850
I've got a lot of them.

1543
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,960
How do you feel?

1544
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:18,100
You did it, didn't you?

1545
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:19,820
You did it, didn't you?

1546
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:22,861
Hurry up and say you did it.

1547
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:25,350
Do you want me to squeeze your butt more?

1548
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:37,950
You're blushing.

1549
01:50:39,490 --> 01:50:40,970
I'm so sleepy.

1550
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:45,190
Go to bed early.

1551
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:51,880
You did it, didn't
you? Go to bed.

1552
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,760
I know.

1553
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:55,020


1554
01:50:56,985 --> 01:50:58,960
Are you not going to tell me?

1555
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:02,031
How long are you going
to make me wait? You are.

1556
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,340
Hurry up.

1557
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:05,170


1558
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:06,760
It's not over yet, is it?

1559
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:10,040
Hurry up and tell me.

1560
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:13,210
I know you did it.

1561
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:16,560
I have all the evidence.

1562
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:18,820
Did you commit
suicide? No, I didn't.

1563
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,720
Yes, you did.

1564
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:21,721


1565
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,480
Hurry up and tell me.

1566
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:27,550
No way.

1567
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:29,150
What?

1568
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,440
What?

1569
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:37,740
Hey.

1570
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:40,080
What's wrong with you?

1571
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:41,740
What's wrong with you?

1572
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:46,520
Who said you could go?

1573
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,480
I did say that, but...

1574
01:51:51,755 --> 01:51:52,755
It's a shame.

1575
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:54,800
It's not a shame.

1576
01:51:56,370 --> 01:52:00,100
It's a shame.

1577
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:02,090
It's a shame.

1578
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:02,990
It's a shame.

1579
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:04,140
It's a shame.

1580
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:06,610
It's a shame.

1581
01:52:06,611 --> 01:52:06,670
It's a shame.

1582
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:06,730
It's a shame.

1583
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:07,110
It's a shame.

1584
01:52:07,111 --> 01:52:07,270
It's a shame.

1585
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,470
Shiku shiku shite.

1586
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:12,490
We don't know anything about that.

1587
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:14,690
Right?

1588
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:20,490
If you don't admit your sins, it won't end.

1589
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:22,250
That's good.

1590
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:24,890
You're still going to go out, right?

1591
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:28,810
There's still a lot in
there, right? Come on.

1592
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:30,330
Let's go.

1593
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:30,990


1594
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:32,490
Are you going?

1595
01:52:32,491 --> 01:52:33,630
Are you going to say it?

1596
01:52:34,730 --> 01:52:35,730
Are you going to say it?

1597
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:37,190
Are you going to say it?

1598
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:38,670
Which one?

1599
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:40,750
Which one is it?

1600
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:01,010
What is this?

1601
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:02,011
Oh my god!

1602
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:11,030
What's going on?

1603
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:17,360
You put salt on my face, didn't you?

1604
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,500
I'll never forgive you.

1605
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,400
What? Today? All night long.

1606
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:26,300


1607
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,460
Until you confess.

1608
01:53:29,461 --> 01:53:38,600
I can't let you go to sleep
until you finish eating.

1609
01:53:40,090 --> 01:53:47,520
Are you still
eating? I won't stop.

1610
01:53:48,665 --> 01:53:50,200
Tell me.

1611
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,940


1612
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,340
I'll do it more and more.

1613
01:53:56,715 --> 01:53:57,760
I'll do it more and more.

1614
01:53:57,761 --> 01:53:58,896
You want me to do it, don't you?

1615
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,260
I'll do it, I'll do it.

1616
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:01,280
I'll do it more.

1617
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,060
I won't let you sleep tonight.

1618
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:15,200
It's hard to spit it out.

1619
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,620
That's right.

1620
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,120
It's because we're weak.

1621
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:23,860
Let's make her spit it out today.

1622
01:54:23,861 --> 01:54:32,080
I've been doing this for a long time.

1623
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:35,671
I was put in a prison like this.

1624
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,720
Don't you regret it yet?

1625
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:40,600
No, it's not me.

1626
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:42,640
It's not me? That's enough.

1627
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,320


1628
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:47,800
I know the story.

1629
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,980
It's a factory.

1630
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:56,880
It's a factory.

1631
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:59,280
How long are you going to keep doing this?

1632
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:04,180
I don't want to, but please forgive me.

1633
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,040
I'll make you confess
with candy and matcha.

1634
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:11,100
I'm not doing it. I'm not angry.

1635
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,361
Do you want me to keep
doing it until you get crazy?

1636
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:21,600
You think it's not bad, don't you?

1637
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,960
I'm not doing it.

1638
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,040
Spread your legs.

1639
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:38,380
It's warm.

1640
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:44,520
You're going to collapse.

1641
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:46,180
Please don't.

1642
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:49,940
But it feels good, so it can't be helped.

1643
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,500
I'm sure you're happy,
aren't you? Oh, wow, wow.

1644
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,540
You're shaking.

1645
01:55:53,541 --> 01:55:54,541
Oh, wow, wow.

1646
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:56,280
Oh, wow, wow.

1647
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,481
But you look happy.

1648
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,340
You've been through so much.

1649
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:10,680
Hey, really, why are you
standing like this today?

1650
01:56:11,885 --> 01:56:13,460
Is it because of the
sweets? I don't know.

1651
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:15,720


1652
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:36,242
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1653
01:56:36,254 --> 01:56:49,280
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1654
01:56:49,281 --> 01:56:50,281
Do you want to
talk? No, I don't.

1655
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,800


1656
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,880
Wow!

1657
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:05,720
Do you want to see? Let me see.

1658
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,220
Let me see.

1659
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:10,080


1660
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,800
Do you want to
change? No, no, no, no.

1661
01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:22,760


1662
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:27,520
Are you alive?

1663
01:57:33,230 --> 01:57:35,820
Did you hurt?

1664
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:39,480
You wanted to get up, didn't you?

1665
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,840
Poor boy!

1666
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:42,555
I can't help it.

1667
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:46,960
You want to get petted, don't you?

1668
01:57:53,700 --> 01:58:05,280
I'll suck your golden
egg and swallow it all.

1669
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,960
I'll make you crazy.

1670
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:16,200
You don't admit it because you
want me to do it, do you? No, I don't.

1671
01:58:16,201 --> 01:58:17,201


1672
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,800
Oh, you don't? You don't use your
delicate hands, do you? No, I don't.

1673
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,000


1674
01:58:29,415 --> 01:58:32,740
Thank you, thank you.

1675
01:58:32,741 --> 01:58:33,900
I'm sorry.

1676
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:35,380
I'm sorry.

1677
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,220
The egg is coming up.

1678
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:05,880
Did you want to go?

1679
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:29,450
It's good, isn't it?

1680
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:32,870
Hey, can you hold it
more? I don't know.

1681
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:35,030


1682
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:38,470
Put your hip down.

1683
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:40,630
I'm going to put it in.

1684
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:42,490
With your boobs.

1685
01:59:44,610 --> 01:59:47,010
Does it feel good?

1686
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:48,250
Does it?

1687
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:49,251
Does it feel good? Oh, I see.

1688
01:59:49,950 --> 01:59:50,950


1689
01:59:51,110 --> 01:59:52,410
You're enjoying it.

1690
01:59:52,510 --> 01:59:54,110
No, I'm not.

1691
01:59:54,970 --> 02:00:00,450
Then, let's add this to your boobs.

1692
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:01,950
What?

1693
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,950
Oh, that's not good.

1694
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,010
That's right.

1695
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:09,250
Take it out.

1696
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:10,510
I can't.

1697
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:11,950
Is it weird?

1698
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:13,770
Don't pull my waist.

1699
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:15,470
Who said you can pull my waist?

1700
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:33,182
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1701
02:00:33,194 --> 02:00:48,070
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1702
02:00:48,071 --> 02:00:50,970
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh What's going to happen?

1703
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:52,690
What's going to happen?

1704
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:53,870
What's going to happen?

1705
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:54,490
What's going to happen?

1706
02:00:54,491 --> 02:00:56,250
I'm going to throw up.

1707
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:58,010
Are you going to throw up?

1708
02:00:58,390 --> 02:01:00,230
Show me your guts.

1709
02:01:02,150 --> 02:01:05,930
Oh, no.

1710
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:16,650
Oh, no.

1711
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:17,970
Oh, my.

1712
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:20,990
You've become strange, Chin-chin.

1713
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:27,230
You, what's wrong?

1714
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:28,970
Ouch! It hurts!

1715
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:30,090
What?

1716
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:31,750
Ouch! It hurts! I can't do it.

1717
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:31,830


1718
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:33,350
Do you want to try again?

1719
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:48,860
Shall we enjoy the nipple together?

1720
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:50,940
Ouch! I can't do it.

1721
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:52,680


1722
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:53,720
Do you want to
stop? I can't do it.

1723
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:54,960


1724
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,280
Do you want to stop?

1725
02:01:57,281 --> 02:01:58,281
Do you want me to do it?

1726
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:00,236
You don't want me to do it, do you?

1727
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,660
You don't want me to do it, do you?

1728
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:20,420
You thought I asked
you to stop, didn't you?

1729
02:02:22,395 --> 02:02:23,436
You don't want me to stop?

1730
02:02:25,265 --> 02:02:26,946
Do you want me to tickle you on the chair?

1731
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:28,560
Come on, come on, come on.

1732
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:29,960
What's wrong with
you? You're fast.

1733
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:34,800


1734
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,180
Are you tired already?

1735
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Isn't it too early? I'm sorry.

1736
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:41,740


1737
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,360
Ouch!

1738
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,220
What's wrong?

1739
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,000
What's wrong? I can't do it.

1740
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:52,580


1741
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:54,500
It's coming from behind.

1742
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:58,460
You don't have to say no.

1743
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,540
We are good friends.

1744
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:27,650
You have become brave.

1745
02:03:31,770 --> 02:03:34,550
You still want to do this
kind of thing, don't you?

1746
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:36,910
Then, I will continue.

1747
02:03:36,911 --> 02:03:38,430
I'll give it to you.

1748
02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:52,890
Here you are.

1749
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:55,890
Chin-chin.

1750
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:01,190
Great! Great! Look at this.

1751
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:01,690


1752
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:03,430
I'm washing my hands from the bottom.

1753
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:06,030
Look at this.

1754
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:07,070
Look at the bottom.

1755
02:04:07,830 --> 02:04:08,930
Look at this.

1756
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:12,110
You have been feeling good
for a long time, haven't you?

1757
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:16,790
I want to eat it someday.

1758
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:18,870
Then, you can take out as many as you want.

1759
02:04:21,870 --> 02:04:23,110
Good, good.

1760
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:24,510
No, no.

1761
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:30,000
It's coming a lot.

1762
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:33,220
Let's lock it.

1763
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:39,720
How is it?

1764
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:41,880
Do you want to be patted?

1765
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,520
You are being patted with your big boobies.

1766
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:47,120
Like this?

1767
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:48,580
Do you want to be
patted? Wow, wow, wow.

1768
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,880


1769
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,580
Come here, come here, come here.

1770
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,360
I will give you a pressure with my boobies.

1771
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,500
Look.

1772
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:03,740
Are you okay? No, no, no.

1773
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:05,280


1774
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:05,880
Are you okay?

1775
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,000
You have a lot of strength in your butt.

1776
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:28,380
Hey, you like my butt, don't you?

1777
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:44,740
Look, I'll be nice to you if you clap.

1778
02:05:44,741 --> 02:05:45,741
What? I don't know.

1779
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:49,820


1780
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:51,080
Don't you know? I don't know.

1781
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:52,940
Hey, hey.

1782
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:56,700


1783
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:00,760
I can't say I don't know.

1784
02:06:07,290 --> 02:06:08,660
You're all red.

1785
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:16,200
Hey, come here for a second.

1786
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:32,040
I'm not asking you what it is.

1787
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,560
I'm asking you what it is.

1788
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:39,900
What is this?

1789
02:06:40,990 --> 02:06:42,740
What do you think
it is? I don't know.

1790
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,820


1791
02:06:44,455 --> 02:06:45,500
Please show me your right eye.

1792
02:06:45,501 --> 02:06:46,501
Raise your right hand.

1793
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:58,900
Raise the other hand.

1794
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:02,100
You have a hard body.

1795
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:10,720
You don't have to support me, do you?

1796
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:16,050
How do you feel? I can't move.

1797
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:21,060
Relax.

1798
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,700


1799
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,920
If you don't, you'll fall.

1800
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:32,940
Hands up.

1801
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:36,440
Pretend you're tied up.

1802
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:37,900
Listen to me.

1803
02:07:43,410 --> 02:07:44,910
Shake, shake, shake, shake.

1804
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:46,030
It's embarrassing.

1805
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:56,850
What is this?

1806
02:07:56,851 --> 02:08:00,510
What's going on? I don't know.

1807
02:08:01,410 --> 02:08:02,410


1808
02:08:02,670 --> 02:08:03,790
You don't look like a human.

1809
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:08,110
Look, look, look.

1810
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:17,590
Wow, Marumi.

1811
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:22,320
I can't hide it.

1812
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
You can't hide it?

1813
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:25,780
You can't let go of my hand.

1814
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,400
Do you understand?

1815
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:28,401
Do you understand?

1816
02:08:28,650 --> 02:08:31,300
Your hands are tied there by your own will.

1817
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,680
Do you understand?

1818
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:35,280
Yes.

1819
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,600
You can't let go.

1820
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:39,920
You can't hide it.

1821
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:41,580
You're tied up.

1822
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:46,840
You're a disgrace.

1823
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,200
You're a loser.

1824
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:50,860
You're just like that.

1825
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:01,240
This is very easy to do.

1826
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:06,420
What are you doing?

1827
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:08,660
Do you want this? Do it now.

1828
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:13,660


1829
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,900
If you confess now, I'll forgive you.

1830
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,100
I didn't do it.

1831
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,440
By the way, who is manufacturing
and selling drugs? I don't know.

1832
02:09:31,405 --> 02:09:33,960
It's not me.

1833
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,280
Then, who is selling
drugs? I don't know.

1834
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:53,681
What are you doing?

1835
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:54,940
I'm cleaning my ears.

1836
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:56,700
What are you cleaning?

1837
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:58,920
I'm not cleaning my ears.

1838
02:09:59,140 --> 02:09:59,480
Who is it? It's not me.

1839
02:09:59,560 --> 02:09:59,820


1840
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,400
It's me, isn't it? I don't know.

1841
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:13,920


1842
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:41,460
It's painful, isn't it?

1843
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:43,340
Your dirty ass looks round.

1844
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:49,920
I want to get up.

1845
02:10:51,130 --> 02:10:53,820
I want to get up.

1846
02:10:53,821 --> 02:10:59,320
I want to get up.

1847
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:01,760
I want to get up.

1848
02:11:01,761 --> 02:11:02,761
You can't get up?

1849
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:05,440
Why don't you take a deep breath?

1850
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:08,140
That's enough, isn't it?

1851
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:10,580
I was about to die.

1852
02:11:10,581 --> 02:11:11,581
You were there just
now! That was close.

1853
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:12,940


1854
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:19,230
We bought this on the
Internet, so it's a bit weird.

1855
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:23,830
That's enough.

1856
02:11:24,430 --> 02:11:25,970
It's boring.

1857
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:31,570
Be a good boy.

1858
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:39,900
Don't raise your head.

1859
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:52,060
Lick him.

1860
02:11:52,061 --> 02:11:58,420
Like this, lick your tongue.

1861
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:02,420
This side, too.

1862
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:08,810
Like a tail.

1863
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:12,050
Lick your tongue.

1864
02:12:12,051 --> 02:12:13,051
Turn around.

1865
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:21,110
You have a hard tail.

1866
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:23,610
It's flat.

1867
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:28,610
You can bend it to the back.

1868
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:32,410
Let's drink from this side.

1869
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:34,970
It's amazing, isn't
it? Don't drop it.

1870
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:38,430


1871
02:12:49,870 --> 02:12:52,770
What is it? Does it feel good?

1872
02:12:54,990 --> 02:12:57,470
Why are you trying to imitate me?

1873
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:00,210
Do you want me to do it for you?

1874
02:13:01,660 --> 02:13:04,010
This one? This one?

1875
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:09,610
Please raise your legs a little.

1876
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:13,610
This is the pose of Shinshin, isn't it?

1877
02:13:25,830 --> 02:13:28,530
You are so cool!

1878
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:36,810
What's wrong with you?

1879
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:39,670
What's wrong with you?

1880
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:44,990
You want to confess, so you
want me to stop you? No, I don't.

1881
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:48,210
You don't? No, I don't.

1882
02:13:48,211 --> 02:13:50,610
You don't, do you?

1883
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:51,910
I'm going to confess again.

1884
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:52,890
You're going to confess?

1885
02:13:53,230 --> 02:13:54,230
Yes.

1886
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:56,270
You're such an ungrateful pervert.

1887
02:13:56,730 --> 02:13:57,550
I'm going to confess.

1888
02:13:57,551 --> 02:14:03,010
If you confess, I'll help you.

1889
02:14:28,150 --> 02:14:32,990
I'll take care of you.

1890
02:14:32,991 --> 02:14:34,151
Do you want to show it to me?

1891
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,770
Show me! Show me! Show me!

1892
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,030
Show me! Show me! Show me!

1893
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:38,590
Show me! Show me! Show me!

1894
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:39,270
Show me! Show me!
Show me! Ah! I knew it.

1895
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:40,870


1896
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:47,370


1897
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:50,480
Is it more than before?

1898
02:14:50,990 --> 02:14:52,271
It's coming out a lot, isn't it?

1899
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:56,296
Is there an angle that is easy to come out?

1900
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:56,920
Wow!

1901
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:58,640
This angle is good.

1902
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:00,320
What?

1903
02:15:00,395 --> 02:15:02,100
What? What? What?

1904
02:15:02,101 --> 02:15:02,480
You're twitching.

1905
02:15:02,965 --> 02:15:04,580
What? What?

1906
02:15:05,090 --> 02:15:06,100
What? Don't move.

1907
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:07,560
What?

1908
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:08,920
What's going on?

1909
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,180
He's rubbing his butt.

1910
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:13,400
I know. I told you I know.

1911
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,140
Look. Look. Look.

1912
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,600
You're covered in blood.

1913
02:15:20,601 --> 02:15:23,920
You have a lot of blood on your face.

1914
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,600
Look at me.

1915
02:15:37,690 --> 02:15:39,171
You have a lot of blood on your face.

1916
02:15:48,145 --> 02:15:50,240
Can you bear with it?

1917
02:15:50,241 --> 02:15:51,241
Can you do it?

1918
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:53,220
Can you do it? Not yet.

1919
02:15:58,080 --> 02:15:59,080


1920
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:05,980
I'll pinch you with my butt.

1921
02:16:05,981 --> 02:16:06,981
Can you do it?

1922
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:22,900
No matter what I do, it's always hard.

1923
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:24,540
Let's do it together.

1924
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:29,760
Oh, it's good.

1925
02:16:29,761 --> 02:16:30,761
It's good, isn't it?

1926
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:36,160
This is good, isn't it?

1927
02:16:37,985 --> 02:16:39,540
It's hard, isn't
it? Hold me tight.

1928
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:45,300


1929
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:51,140
It's painful, isn't it?

1930
02:16:51,141 --> 02:16:52,260
It's dark, isn't it?

1931
02:16:58,060 --> 02:16:59,920
You are sensitive, aren't you?

1932
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:07,840
What? Is it hard?

1933
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:11,120
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

1934
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:18,250
You said that again.

1935
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:25,870
I'll do something hard for you.

1936
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:28,690
Why don't you just spit it out?

1937
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:32,790
I'm not going to tell you
how long it's going to take.

1938
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:39,410
I told you I don't want it.

1939
02:17:45,610 --> 02:17:47,150
It's all in my mouth.

1940
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:49,830
I told you I don't want it.

1941
02:17:51,170 --> 02:17:53,870
You don't want it? Confess it.

1942
02:18:02,210 --> 02:18:06,350
It's hard to stand up, isn't it?

1943
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:09,890
If you don't like it, you have to stand up.

1944
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:13,210
You're standing up without permission.

1945
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:14,870
You're right.

1946
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:19,370
Look, look, look.

1947
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:22,550
This nipple is cute.

1948
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:27,790
You want me to turn the wheel, don't you?

1949
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:30,411
What do you want me to do?

1950
02:18:30,850 --> 02:18:31,250
Hurry up!

1951
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:33,170
What do you want me to do?

1952
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:33,690
What do you want me to do?

1953
02:18:33,691 --> 02:18:34,691
Turn the wheel!

1954
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:36,690
What do you want me to do?

1955
02:18:37,210 --> 02:18:38,210
Wow!

1956
02:18:39,230 --> 02:18:39,590
Wow!

1957
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:39,890
Wow!

1958
02:18:39,891 --> 02:18:40,891
Wow!

1959
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:41,950
Wow!

1960
02:18:44,130 --> 02:18:45,130
Wow!

1961
02:18:45,390 --> 02:18:45,530
Wow!

1962
02:18:45,850 --> 02:18:46,110
Wow!

1963
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:46,910
Wow!

1964
02:18:47,390 --> 02:18:47,630
Wow!

1965
02:18:47,631 --> 02:18:47,670
Wow!

1966
02:18:48,210 --> 02:18:49,210
Wow!

1967
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:51,150
Wow!

1968
02:18:52,670 --> 02:18:53,330
Wow!

1969
02:18:53,331 --> 02:18:55,330
Was it a mistake to make
it stronger? That's good.

1970
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:04,430
It's in.

1971
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:07,030
It's in.

1972
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:08,110
It's in.

1973
02:19:08,490 --> 02:19:16,710
You wanted me to make
it stronger, didn't you?

1974
02:19:19,050 --> 02:19:20,170
Then, do you want to say it?

1975
02:19:21,010 --> 02:19:24,050
Hurry up and say it.

1976
02:19:24,630 --> 02:19:26,650
I'm not doing it.

1977
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:30,130
Say it.

1978
02:19:30,770 --> 02:19:32,210
How long do you think
it will last? I don't know.

1979
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:34,430
Oh, no.

1980
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:36,750
Oh, no.

1981
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:40,450
Oh, no.

1982
02:19:42,310 --> 02:19:43,470


1983
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:58,280
It's fun, isn't it? Let's have more fun.

1984
02:19:58,281 --> 02:19:59,281
Let's do it.

1985
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:00,540
Come here.

1986
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:02,460
Move your body.

1987
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:04,740
Stand up.

1988
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:13,210
I see.

1989
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,740
That's right.

1990
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:24,180
I was surprised when I was inside.

1991
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,600
Please move.

1992
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:29,320
Of course.

1993
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:31,400
Please move.

1994
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:36,940
Do you feel good? Please move.

1995
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:39,720


1996
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:45,900
What are you doing?

1997
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:48,020
Do you think you are forgiven?

1998
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:49,360
Please move more.

1999
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:54,140
Please move more.

2000
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:55,580
More, more!

2001
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,280
That's right, that's right.

2002
02:20:58,140 --> 02:21:00,680
You've been moving a lot lately.

2003
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:02,740
That's right, that's right.

2004
02:21:02,741 --> 02:21:04,480
You're moving more than I am.

2005
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,560
That's right, that's right.

2006
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:21,920
You did it, didn't you?

2007
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:26,990
You're the culprit, aren't you?

2008
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:41,380
I'm not the culprit!

2009
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,980
Hey!

2010
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:47,940
I want to do it more.

2011
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:49,660
Again!

2012
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:52,420
Hey!

2013
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:56,400
It's still moving.

2014
02:22:06,750 --> 02:22:09,150
No, no.

2015
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:11,450
It's moving.

2016
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:17,700
It's moving more and more.

2017
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:20,180
It's coming out.

2018
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,780
It's coming out.

2019
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:49,060
No.

2020
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:46,690
What's going on with her?

2021
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:48,270
Did she get out?

2022
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:52,170
Oh my god!

2023
02:23:53,330 --> 02:23:54,330
Wow!

2024
02:23:56,450 --> 02:23:58,650
Did she get out? She ran away.

2025
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:01,710


2026
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:04,310
Wow! She got out!

2027
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:07,690
Did she get out two times?

2028
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:12,730
I don't know what to do.

2029
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:17,210
Do you want to be more crazy?

2030
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:24,850
I'm not ready yet.

2031
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:28,150
Let me have fun.

2032
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:31,610
I'm not ready yet.

2033
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:33,510
I know.

2034
02:24:34,570 --> 02:24:36,210
Don't worry. You'll be fine soon.

2035
02:24:36,211 --> 02:24:37,211
I wonder if you like it.

2036
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:44,370
It's still warm here, isn't it?

2037
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:47,670
Oh, great! What's this?

2038
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:00,250
Chinko, you're the
best! Hold my hand.

2039
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:03,590


2040
02:25:04,670 --> 02:25:05,170
Yes.

2041
02:25:05,171 --> 02:25:26,522
I want more, more, more

2042
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:50,650
This is good.

2043
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:52,350
The hardness is totally different.

2044
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:53,990
What's going on? It's good.

2045
02:25:54,310 --> 02:25:55,310


2046
02:25:56,590 --> 02:25:57,590
How about this?

2047
02:25:57,630 --> 02:25:58,630
Oh, it came off.

2048
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:00,610
Oh, thank you.

2049
02:26:02,290 --> 02:26:04,210
It won't come off.

2050
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:32,350
You can't do it anymore?

2051
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:34,810
Do you want to do
it again? My sex is.

2052
02:26:35,150 --> 02:26:37,490
..

2053
02:26:37,491 --> 02:26:39,230
So, please don't do this to me.

2054
02:26:55,380 --> 02:27:00,880
Not yet.

2055
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:04,940
Come here.

2056
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:12,120
Here, put it in my pussy.

2057
02:27:12,121 --> 02:27:14,100
Put it in here.

2058
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:15,820
What are you doing? Come here.

2059
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,200
Fold your legs.

2060
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:23,460
Give me a kiss. Hurry up.

2061
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:25,900
Give me a kiss.

2062
02:27:36,980 --> 02:27:38,320
Why are you shaking your waist?

2063
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:39,660
Why?

2064
02:27:39,661 --> 02:27:41,340
You're not moving at all, are you?

2065
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:44,340
Don't make yourself nervous.

2066
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,040
Come here.

2067
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:54,140
Move, move, move, move.

2068
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:56,380
Why don't you say anything?

2069
02:27:57,120 --> 02:27:58,920
Come on, be nice to me.

2070
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:04,640
Let's go home.

2071
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:07,620
Go to the limit.

2072
02:28:07,621 --> 02:28:08,621
You can do it.

2073
02:28:12,815 --> 02:28:14,340
It's not over yet.

2074
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:17,180
How much ramen can you eat?

2075
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:21,430
I can't take it off.

2076
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:23,200
Don't take it off.

2077
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:26,130
I'm taking it off.

2078
02:28:26,250 --> 02:28:27,750
Oh, no, no, no.

2079
02:28:27,970 --> 02:28:28,970
It feels good.

2080
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:32,550
Oh, wait.

2081
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:33,930
I'm gonna take it off.

2082
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:55,020
Why are you so quiet?

2083
02:28:56,500 --> 02:29:05,980
I think you should be more quiet.

2084
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:26,950
Come here.

2085
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:40,500
This is it.

2086
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:54,300
This is a great one.

2087
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:56,280
What's going to happen?

2088
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:59,640
What's going to happen?

2089
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:01,880
What's going to happen if you
put it on your mouth? This is good.

2090
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:09,720


2091
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:11,580
What?

2092
02:30:18,430 --> 02:30:19,810
Your mouth looks very lonely.

2093
02:30:21,170 --> 02:30:22,170
What? Go to him.

2094
02:30:22,650 --> 02:30:25,110
He wants to lick
your eye boogers.

2095
02:30:26,730 --> 02:30:27,730
Go to him.

2096
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:30,980
I'm going.

2097
02:30:30,981 --> 02:30:31,981
I'm going.

2098
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:33,660
What?

2099
02:30:33,661 --> 02:30:40,270
I was going to let you lick me.

2100
02:30:46,350 --> 02:30:48,430
Come on, lick me.

2101
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:50,010
That's right.

2102
02:30:50,770 --> 02:30:52,270
I haven't come out yet.

2103
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:54,310
What? What's wrong?

2104
02:30:55,790 --> 02:30:57,290
I know you came out.

2105
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:00,210
You came out.

2106
02:31:03,250 --> 02:31:04,250
Ah!

2107
02:31:04,970 --> 02:31:06,030
Ah!

2108
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:08,930
Ah!

2109
02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:10,570
Ah!

2110
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:14,530
Haah!

2111
02:31:15,530 --> 02:31:16,690
You're all out!

2112
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:17,930
I am!

2113
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:19,640
Are you out? Are there
so many of you? A lot.

2114
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:21,490


2115
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:23,980
Ahh!

2116
02:31:24,430 --> 02:31:25,490
Ah!

2117
02:31:26,010 --> 02:31:27,010
There is still more.

2118
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:28,490
Oh!

2119
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:31,330
He's eating a lot.

2120
02:31:36,830 --> 02:31:38,370
It's not the end.

2121
02:31:39,870 --> 02:31:41,150
Did you think it was the end?

2122
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:46,390
He's eating a lot.

2123
02:31:47,190 --> 02:31:48,190
He's eating a lot.

2124
02:31:48,890 --> 02:31:50,050
It's painful, isn't it?

2125
02:31:51,230 --> 02:31:53,010
It's not fun to eat a lot.

2126
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:54,490
Is that so?

2127
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:58,650
He's eating a lot.

2128
02:32:23,650 --> 02:32:26,890
Chikubi, I'll do it for you.

2129
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:28,870
This is great.

2130
02:32:45,610 --> 02:32:46,750
Chikubi, do you feel good?

2131
02:32:47,350 --> 02:33:21,510
Chinchin, you can do it.

2132
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:23,380
I also shook my hips together.

2133
02:33:25,130 --> 02:33:26,270
We all feel good.

2134
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:28,290
Are you tired?

2135
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:30,350
What's wrong?

2136
02:33:30,770 --> 02:33:32,070
But Chinchin is moving.

2137
02:33:32,390 --> 02:33:33,390
No, no, no.

2138
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:41,650
There are a lot of lumps.

2139
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:42,650
It's true.

2140
02:33:42,890 --> 02:33:43,970
The viscosity is very high.

2141
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:46,190
It's amazing.

2142
02:33:48,850 --> 02:33:49,850
I ate it.

2143
02:33:55,985 --> 02:34:03,650
I think you can still do it.

2144
02:34:06,190 --> 02:34:07,190
It's still hard.

2145
02:34:08,410 --> 02:34:09,410
What's wrong? I can't do it.

2146
02:34:10,010 --> 02:34:11,010


2147
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:12,910
What's wrong?

2148
02:34:13,850 --> 02:34:15,790
You're noisy, Onikichi.

2149
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:18,050
I told you to sit up.

2150
02:34:24,165 --> 02:34:25,510
I can't do it.

2151
02:34:26,250 --> 02:34:27,250
What's wrong?

2152
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:31,910
What's wrong? I can't do it.

2153
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:33,230


2154
02:34:33,610 --> 02:34:34,610
What's wrong? Oh, no.

2155
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:36,710


2156
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:46,750
What are you doing in
front of Momoko's eyes?

2157
02:34:50,410 --> 02:34:51,966
What are you doing in
front of Momoko's eyes?

2158
02:34:51,990 --> 02:34:54,510
What's wrong?

2159
02:34:56,090 --> 02:34:59,370
What's wrong?

2160
02:34:59,371 --> 02:35:00,371
What do you want to do?

2161
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:09,440
You can still do it,
can't you? No, I can't.

2162
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:12,720
I really can't.

2163
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:15,760
You really can't?

2164
02:35:16,420 --> 02:35:17,640
You really can't?

2165
02:35:19,470 --> 02:35:22,480
Do you really think you can do it?

2166
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:26,600
Hey, hey!

2167
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,900
You can still do it,
can't you? No, I can't.

2168
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:46,780
Wow, wow.

2169
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:50,600


2170
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:53,840
What? What?

2171
02:35:53,841 --> 02:35:54,841
What?

2172
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:57,800
No, no, no!

2173
02:35:57,801 --> 02:35:58,801
This one?

2174
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:01,140
No, no, no!

2175
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:02,160
Look!

2176
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:03,680
No, no, no!

2177
02:36:03,681 --> 02:36:06,000
No, no, no!

2178
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:08,480
No, no, no!

2179
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:15,880
No, no, no!

2180
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:16,900
Hey!

2181
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:18,480
No, no, no!

2182
02:36:18,481 --> 02:36:19,481
No, no, no!

2183
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:20,340
No, no, no!

2184
02:36:20,341 --> 02:36:28,120
No, no, no!

2185
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:29,620
Hey, wait a second!

2186
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:31,420
Oh, oh, you're doing it again!

2187
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:33,320
No, no, no, no!

2188
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:34,340
Oh, my legs!

2189
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:36,800
Oh, my legs!

2190
02:36:36,801 --> 02:36:40,460
I'm telling you… I'm telling
you… No, I can't… I'm telling you…

2191
02:36:40,461 --> 02:36:47,220
No, no, no… I can't do it.

2192
02:36:47,221 --> 02:36:48,860
You're not crazy.

2193
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:53,860
It's too late.

2194
02:36:56,485 --> 02:36:58,100
It's too late.

2195
02:36:58,350 --> 02:37:03,500
After all, I also thought a little.

2196
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:07,180
Let's ask one more time.

2197
02:37:09,620 --> 02:37:10,620
You!

2198
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:13,180
Don't you do it? I don't do it.

2199
02:37:14,190 --> 02:37:15,520


2200
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:17,000
You said something.

2201
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:25,360
I understand.

2202
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:28,560
I believe you are invincible.

2203
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:30,600
What?

2204
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:37,800
I think it's only Shiro who does
this much and doesn't spit it out.

2205
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:42,240
I'm sorry.

2206
02:37:45,110 --> 02:37:48,460
We were excited, too.

2207
02:37:50,490 --> 02:37:53,320
But, you know, your
father felt good, didn't he?

2208
02:37:54,540 --> 02:37:55,780
He made a lot of noise.

2209
02:37:58,330 --> 02:38:03,090
So I did something bad,
but I felt good, and I felt good,

2210
02:38:03,102 --> 02:38:07,540
so I have a lot of things
to apologize for next time.

2211
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:14,019
Well, I did a pretty bad
thing, so if you'd like to

2212
02:38:14,031 --> 02:38:19,180
apologize again, I'll
take care of it at any time.

2213
02:38:19,181 --> 02:38:20,181
I'm going to investigate.

2214
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:24,040
Well, that's what it is.

2215
02:38:24,700 --> 02:38:25,160
I'm sorry.

2216
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:27,700
I'm going to investigate.

2217
02:38:27,725 --> 02:38:29,300
I'm going to investigate.

2218
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:32,540
Well, good job.

2219
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:36,320
You can go home without permission.

2220
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:38,800
Well, then.

2221
02:39:09,610 --> 02:39:12,230
I was told that I would be
investigated at any time.
