1
11.31 --> 13.31
 Thank you for your hard work.

2
13.31 --> 14.31
 Thank you for your hard work.

3
14.31 --> 15.31
 What's your name?

4
15.31 --> 17.31
 My name is Nana Oyagi.

5
17.31 --> 18.31
 Nana Oyagi.

6
18.31 --> 20.31
 Today is your second anniversary, right?

7
20.31 --> 21.31
 That's right.

8
21.31 --> 22.31
 Congratulations.

9
22.31 --> 24.31
 Thank you very much.

10
24.31 --> 26.31
 Today's shooting is...

11
26.31 --> 30.31
 When I got the script, I was wondering if I could do it.

12
30.31 --> 33.31
 Anyway, it's my first time.

13
33.31 --> 40.31
 I was nervous and couldn't sleep at all yesterday.

14
41.31 --> 47.31
 But I had a chance to talk to the director and Mr. Samoari beforehand.

15
47.31 --> 50.31
 So I was looking forward to it.

16
50.31 --> 57.31
 It's a project where I get to spend the night with a male M.O.

17
57.31 --> 67.31
 And I stay in Mr. Samoari's studio until the morning.

18
67.31 --> 69.31
 We were together in the evening.

19
69.31 --> 72.31
 We were together for two days.

20
72.31 --> 76.31
 We were flirting all the time.

21
76.31 --> 80.31
 We were flirting all the time.

22
80.31 --> 86.31
 But it was totally different from our daily life.

23
86.31 --> 93.31
 I'm not dating him, but I'm getting used to the feeling of dating him.

24
93.31 --> 99.31
 I had a lot of fun in the middle of the short time.

25
99.31 --> 105.31
 I thought he was cute for the first time.

26
105.31 --> 108.31
 I thought so naturally.

27
108.31 --> 114.31
 My favorite type is...

28
114.31 --> 117.31
 I remember the person I'm going to meet today.

29
117.31 --> 119.31
 I'm glad to hear that.

30
119.31 --> 125.31
 It's fun to attack after today's shooting.

31
125.31 --> 129.31
 I like to be attacked.

32
129.31 --> 136.31
 I think it would be nice to have someone who can enjoy both.

33
136.31 --> 138.31
 That's my tip.

34
138.31 --> 142.31
 I think it's fun.

35
142.31 --> 144.31
 But it was fun.

36
144.31 --> 146.31
 It was fun.

37
146.31 --> 154.31
 I could feel that he was getting closer to me.

38
154.31 --> 156.31
 I had a lot of fun.

39
156.31 --> 157.31
 Thank you.

40
157.31 --> 166.31
 When we said goodbye today, I said it again.

41
166.31 --> 172.31
 I wanted to attack him a lot because it was the last time.

42
172.31 --> 174.31
 My favorite type is...

43
174.31 --> 176.31
 It's hard to choose.

44
176.31 --> 183.31
 I saw the scene of the man for the first time.

45
183.31 --> 186.31
 I was very excited.

46
186.31 --> 188.31
 That scene was great.

47
188.31 --> 191.31
 Which scene do you like better?

48
191.31 --> 195.31
 The scene I saw for the first time.

49
195.31 --> 197.31
 It was the first time I saw it.

50
197.31 --> 199.31
 My favorite type is a woman.

51
199.31 --> 201.31
 Do you like a manly man?

52
201.31 --> 203.31
 I like a manly man.

53
203.31 --> 204.31
 Why?

54
204.31 --> 207.31
 I think it's because I had a lot of fun today.

55
207.31 --> 208.31
 Clothes?

56
208.31 --> 209.31
 Yes.

57
209.31 --> 215.31
 I've been wearing a lot of Mercury Ryo lately.

58
215.31 --> 220.31
 I also like Chikubi.

59
220.31 --> 222.31
 I see.

60
222.31 --> 224.31
 What's the next project?

61
225.31 --> 229.31
 It's a project I've never done before.

62
229.31 --> 236.31
 It's my second anniversary, and it's the first time I've done it.

63
236.31 --> 239.31
 It's my third anniversary.

64
240.31 --> 243.31
 I want to be different from the first and second years.

65
243.31 --> 256.31
 I want to be a cute woman from the beginning of Chijo.

66
256.31 --> 261.31
 I don't know what's going to happen in a year.

67
261.31 --> 264.31
 You may be a woman who likes to bully men.

68
264.31 --> 267.31
 I think I can do more now.

69
267.31 --> 269.31
 You can do it next time.

70
270.31 --> 273.31
 All of my paintings.

71
273.31 --> 274.31
 Thank you.

72
274.31 --> 275.31
 That's a good point.

73
275.31 --> 277.31
 I'm going to see everything.

74
277.31 --> 278.31
 I want you to see it.

75
278.31 --> 281.31
 I want you to see this without skipping.

76
281.31 --> 289.31
 I think it depends on the scene.

77
289.31 --> 292.31
 We're really shooting together.

78
294.31 --> 311.31
 I want you to do it when you want to do it in your daily life.

79
311.31 --> 313.31
 I want you to see it.

80
313.31 --> 320.31
 Thank you for buying my first Chijo work.

81
320.31 --> 322.31
 You can say it's your 20th anniversary.

82
322.31 --> 326.31
 Thank you for the 20th anniversary.

83
326.31 --> 332.31
 It's a challenge for me.

84
332.31 --> 337.31
 It's also a work that I wanted to meet.

85
337.31 --> 342.31
 Please watch it a lot and like me.

86
342.31 --> 345.31
 Please watch it for the third anniversary.

87
345.31 --> 347.31
 Good evening.

88
347.31 --> 349.31
 Thank you.

89
355.69 --> 356.69
 Good evening.

90
356.69 --> 358.69
 I'm Tomoya.

91
358.69 --> 363.69
 I'm meeting Yagi Nana.

92
363.69 --> 365.69
 I'm going to meet her.

93
365.69 --> 366.69
 I'm going to meet her.

94
367.69 --> 368.69
 I'm going to meet her.

95
368.69 --> 376.26
 Today is the 20th anniversary.

96
376.26 --> 381.26
 I'm wearing a dignified costume.

97
381.26 --> 385.02
 It's my first time meeting her.

98
385.02 --> 394.02
 I'm going to meet her.

99
394.02 --> 399.29
 I'm a little nervous.

100
400.29 --> 403.29
 I'm here.

101
403.29 --> 405.29
 I'm going to meet her.

102
409.66 --> 421.23
 Hello.

103
421.23 --> 424.23
 Please sit next to me.

104
429.63 --> 430.63
 Nice to meet you.

105
431.63 --> 433.63
 Nice to meet you.

106
433.63 --> 447.57
 I'm Tomoya.

107
447.57 --> 451.57
 Nice to meet you.

108
451.57 --> 453.57
 I'm nervous.

109
453.57 --> 455.57
 I'm nervous.

110
455.57 --> 457.57
 I didn't know if I could drink.

111
457.57 --> 459.57
 I ordered a beer.

112
459.57 --> 460.57
 Are you okay?

113
460.57 --> 462.57
 Let's toast.

114
490.20 --> 499.71
 I'm wearing a dignified costume today.

115
515.90 --> 548.52
 I want to go to the bathroom.

116
548.52 --> 549.52
 Thank you.

117
587.81 --> 591.81
 I'm glad to meet you.

118
591.81 --> 592.81
 I'm glad.

119
601.78 --> 605.78
 I'm going to the bathroom now.

120
606.78 --> 608.78
 Let's go together.

121
608.78 --> 609.78
 Until morning.

122
610.78 --> 611.78
 Until morning.

123
611.78 --> 612.78
 Until morning.

124
612.78 --> 613.78
 Until morning.

125
624.40 --> 625.40
 This way?

126
625.40 --> 626.40
 This way.

127
627.40 --> 629.40
 What should I call you?

128
631.40 --> 632.40
 Tomoya.

129
633.40 --> 635.40
 I'm Tomoya.

130
635.40 --> 637.40
 You can call me Tomo-kun.

131
637.40 --> 638.40
 Tomo-kun?

132
638.40 --> 639.40
 Sounds good.

133
639.40 --> 640.40
 Sounds good.

134
641.40 --> 645.40
 What should I call you?

135
647.40 --> 649.40
 Can I call you Nana-chan?

136
649.40 --> 650.40
 Yes.

137
651.40 --> 653.40
 Please call me a lot.

138
653.40 --> 654.40
 Okay.

139
654.40 --> 658.40
 I'll call you Tomo-kun and Nana-chan.

140
658.40 --> 659.40
 I'm going to bed.

141
660.40 --> 665.40
 I'm going to stay in this house until morning.

142
667.40 --> 668.40
 It's dark.

143
668.40 --> 669.40
 It's dark.

144
669.40 --> 670.40
 Are you okay?

145
670.40 --> 671.40
 I'm okay.

146
671.40 --> 676.40
 The surroundings are white.

147
676.40 --> 678.40
 It's fashionable.

148
683.40 --> 685.40
 I'm nervous.

149
685.40 --> 686.40
 Yes.

150
686.40 --> 687.40
 Please.

151
687.40 --> 689.40
 Thank you.

152
689.40 --> 697.15
 Please.

153
705.70 --> 706.70
 It's dark.

154
706.70 --> 707.70
 It's dark.

155
724.33 --> 725.33
 It's wide.

156
727.33 --> 728.33
 It's cold.

157
743.48 --> 744.48
 It's too wide.

158
744.48 --> 745.48
 It's too wide.

159
746.48 --> 747.48
 Do you want to drink something?

160
747.48 --> 748.48
 Yes.

161
759.48 --> 760.48
 Do you have a refrigerator?

162
760.48 --> 761.48
 Refrigerator?

163
761.48 --> 762.48
 Yes.

164
778.78 --> 779.78
 I'm sorry.

165
781.78 --> 797.98
 I'm sorry.

166
797.98 --> 798.98
 Do you have milk?

167
798.98 --> 799.98
 Yes.

168
800.98 --> 801.98
 I'm sorry.

169
808.19 --> 809.19
 Do you have milk?

170
809.19 --> 810.19
 Yes.

171
812.76 --> 813.76
 Do you drink it every week?

172
813.76 --> 814.76
 Yes.

173
830.89 --> 832.89
 Do you drink alcohol?

174
833.89 --> 834.89
 I don't drink alcohol.

175
834.89 --> 835.89
 I don't know.

176
836.89 --> 837.89
 Cheers!

177
838.89 --> 839.89
 Thank you for your hard work.

178
839.89 --> 840.89
 Thank you for your hard work.

179
840.89 --> 841.89
 From now on.

180
841.89 --> 842.89
 From now on.

181
847.06 --> 848.06
 How is it?

182
848.06 --> 849.06
 It's good.

183
849.06 --> 850.06
 Is it good?

184
851.06 --> 852.06
 I'm glad.

185
858.33 --> 860.33
 I can't help looking at you.

186
861.33 --> 862.33
 Because you are cute.

187
863.33 --> 864.33
 Do you want to drink it?

188
864.33 --> 865.33
 Yes.

189
865.33 --> 866.33
 I'll drink it later.

190
866.33 --> 867.33
 Really?

191
867.33 --> 868.33
 Are you nervous?

192
869.33 --> 870.33
 I'm nervous.

193
870.33 --> 871.33
 Are you nervous?

194
874.33 --> 876.33
 You won't come here until tomorrow.

195
877.33 --> 878.33
 Yes.

196
882.28 --> 883.28
 Are you ready?

197
885.91 --> 920.99
 I'm ready.

198
920.99 --> 921.99
 I'm not nervous.

199
921.99 --> 922.99
 I'm not nervous.

200
975.54 --> 976.54
 Do you want to drink it?

201
976.54 --> 977.54
 Yes.

202
978.54 --> 979.54
 Do you want to drink it?

203
979.54 --> 980.54
 Yes.

204
980.54 --> 981.54
 Yes.

205
996.71 --> 997.71
 It's good.

206
997.71 --> 998.71
 It's good.

207
1015.57 --> 1016.57
 It's good.

208
1016.57 --> 1017.57
 It feels good.

209
1020.57 --> 1021.57
 It's good, isn't it?

210
1022.57 --> 1023.57
 Does it feel good?

211
1024.57 --> 1025.57
 Yes.

212
1026.57 --> 1027.57
 You are cute.

213
1027.57 --> 1030.71
 Do you want to drink it?

214
1043.54 --> 1047.54
 If you give me a good reaction, I don't want to touch you.

215
1049.54 --> 1051.54
 I want to touch you.

216
1071.31 --> 1072.31
 Do you want to drink it?

217
1072.31 --> 1073.31
 Yes.

218
1074.31 --> 1075.31
 It's swollen.

219
1075.31 --> 1076.31
 It doesn't matter.

220
1083.79 --> 1084.79
 I'm sorry.

221
1086.79 --> 1097.68
 Do you want to drink it?

222
1097.68 --> 1098.68
 Yes.

223
1139.59 --> 1144.98
 It feels good.

224
1149.98 --> 1154.59
 Do you want to drink it?

225
1155.59 --> 1176.46
 Do you want to drink it?

226
1179.46 --> 1180.46
 It feels good.

227
1214.63 --> 1221.49
 It feels good.

228
1221.49 --> 1222.49
 Do you want to drink it?

229
1226.49 --> 1229.49
 I have to use the ball drowning in you.

230
1229.49 --> 1230.49
 I have to use the ball drowning in you.

231
1230.49 --> 1231.49
 We use the ball.

232
1231.49 --> 1232.49
 We use the ball.

233
1237.49 --> 1238.49
 I do this all the time.

234

 Do you want to stand up?

250
1382.42 --> 1383.42
 Do you want to stand up?

251
1421.10 --> 1422.10
 Do you want to lie down?

 No, I'm weak.

260
1455.92 --> 1456.92
 Are you weak?

261
1483.36 --> 1484.36
 What's wrong?

262
1484.36 --> 1486.36
 You look so sleepy.

263

406
2603.11 --> 2605.11
 Really?

407

458
9782.58 --> 9784.58
 Does it feel good?

459
9784.58 --> 9786.58
 Yes.

460
9786.58 --> 9788.58
 I'm sorry.

461
9788.58 --> 9790.58
 You can't say that.

462
9790.58 --> 9792.58
 I want you to say more.

463
9798.58 --> 9799.58
 Thank you.

464
9799.58 --> 9800.58
 It was fun.

465
9800.58 --> 9801.58
 Thank you.

466
9801.58 --> 9803.58
 I had a lot of fun.

467
9803.58 --> 9804.58
 Really?

468
9804.58 --> 9805.58
 Yes.

469
9809.86 --> 9815.18
 Thank you.

470
9827.23 --> 9842.51
 I'll never forget you.

471
9842.51 --> 9844.51
 I'll never forget you, either.

472
9845.51 --> 9846.51
 Thank you.

473
9847.51 --> 9850.08
 How was it?

474
9851.08 --> 9852.08
 I had a lot of fun.

475
9852.08 --> 9853.08
 Did you?

476
9853.08 --> 9854.08
 Yes.

477
9854.08 --> 9857.08
 Let's go to pick up the package.

478
9857.08 --> 9858.08
 The package?

479
9858.08 --> 9859.08
 Yes.

480
9859.08 --> 9860.08
 Tomoko has it.

481
9860.08 --> 9861.08
 Let's go to pick up the package.

482
9861.08 --> 9862.08
 Yes.

483
9865.71 --> 9866.71
 Say bye-bye.

484
9867.71 --> 9870.71
 I'm going to pick up the package.

485
9870.71 --> 9871.71
 Bye-bye.

486
9893.37 --> 9894.37
 Bye-bye.
