1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,990
Hey, Aya-san.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:05,640
Yes? Here you are.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060


4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,600
I was going to send it by video,
but let's use the computer today.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,180
OK.

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,850
I'm back.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,140
Welcome back.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,120
I drank too much.

9
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,790
You've been drinking a lot lately.

10
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,791
That's good.

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,850
It's called team building.

12
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,550
Everyone is participating,
so you can't refuse, can you?

13
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:08,975
I don't like that kind of thing.

14
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:12,650
Where are you going after a long time?

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,410
I have an appointment
with the team tomorrow.

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,670
Until the day off?

17
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:22,991
Until the day of the competition?

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,010
They want to unite to improve
the team's performance.

19
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm going to take a shower.

20
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,410
OK.

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,450
What time will you
be back? I don't know.

22
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,730
I'll call you later.

23
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:02,731
I see.

24
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,030
See you.

25
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,060
Employee trip.

26
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,830
It looks fun.

27
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,080
Team building.

28
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,760
Hey, everyone, take your luggage.

29
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,490
Let's go!

30
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,010
Look!
There is a person who is working hard.

31
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,850
Isn't it too early? I'm sorry.

32
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,150


33
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,210
What?

34
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,590
Are you shooting? Yes, I am.

35
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,030


36
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,238
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

37
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,150
no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

38
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,730
There's a shortage of meat in the store.

39
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,050
Do you want me to get you a car?

40
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:00,750
Do you want to drink?

41
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,870
No, I don't want to.

42
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,030
I'll pay you later.

43
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070
Really? Excuse me.

44
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,230


45
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,490
How much do you want to drink?

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,910
I'll drink a lot.

47
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,090
I'll drink a lot.

48
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,390
I'll drink a lot.

49
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,830
Have fun.

50
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,470
How much do you want to drink?

51
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:23,190
I'll drink a lot.

52
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,670
Why? Let's have fun.

53
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,910
Let's have fun.

54
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:26,911


55
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,170
Thank you for your cooperation today.

56
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,830
Do you have anything to say?

57
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,010
I want to get along with
everyone in the morning.

58
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,790
Thank you for your cooperation.

59
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,590
Are you OK?

60
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,730
I'll close the car.

61
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,360
It seems to catch fire.

62
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,791
Where is the fire extinguisher?

63
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,100
It's in somewhere, isn't it?

64
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,820
Do you want to take it out?

65
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,460
The girls are having fun.

66
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,371
Do you want to take a picture?

67
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,300
Can I take a picture of you?

68
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,020
Let's take a picture together.

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
Say cheese!

70
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Let's take another one.

71
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Cheese!

72
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
Do you want to take
a picture? Yes, please.

73
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,300


74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,020
Please check it.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Thank you.

76
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,760
Are you sure? Yes, I am.

77
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,661
I only have a meat brush.

78
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,380
You can't grill it raw.

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
I have to grill it well.

80
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,420
There is only meat and sake.

81
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,560
What are you going to do?

82
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm going to take a video.

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,700
Isn't it cute?

84
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,340
It's cute, isn't it?

85
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,742
Is it okay if I take a video there?

86
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,180
I want to go in there.

87
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,560
You don't have to wear a swimsuit.

88
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
You can take it off.

89
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,900
I can't take it off.

90
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,260
I'm embarrassed.

91
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,960
Are you embarrassed?

92
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,880
Don't get angry.

93
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,160
We came here to get along with you.

94
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,000
Wow, you are back.

95
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,740
I'll have a drink.

96
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,740
Do you? I'll get ready.

97
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,900
You can drink it.

98
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,400
You want to drink it,
don't you? No, it's clean.

99
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,640


100
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,530
Anything is fine.

101
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,130
Strong at first?

102
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Strong at first?

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,040
I'm going to drink with my senior.

104
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
There is a bad guy.

105
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,460
There is a bad guy who
is trying to hurt his senior.

106
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
Who is it?

107
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,620
Look, look, look.

108
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
There are two bad guys.

109
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,680
How do you feel? It's cold.

110
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Hello.

111
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320


112
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,960
Girls, let's take a group photo.

113
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
Cheese.

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
Shall we send this to
everyone later? Yes, please.

115
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,020


116
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
Let's take a lot of SNS.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You look blank.

118
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,680
Smile.

119
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,926
We were chosen by the team of
the new project, but first of all, we

120
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:35,700
thought that we should know
each other, so we proposed this trip.

121
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Please think that it is
not just an employee trip.

122
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,620
Team building, teamwork
improvement, communication.

123
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,680
We came here with a plan.

124
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:49,681
We came here with a plan.

125
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
It's melting.

126
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,656
I don't know if it's good
to eat it with a side dish.

127
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,160
It's good to eat it with a side dish.

128
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,820
Let's enjoy today.

129
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,470
The meat is just right.

130
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,190
It's delicious.

131
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,470
It's delicious.

132
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,870
It's delicious.

133
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,550
It's good.

134
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,551
I think it's good.

135
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,390
Let's eat.

136
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,410
What do you use
for meat? Tongue.

137
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,590


138
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,010
Which one?

139
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,610
How about meat
tongue? That's good.

140
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,730


141
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,990
We don't have enough meat.

142
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,410
Did you work?

143
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,010
I'm busy to take a commemorative video.

144
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,630
I don't have a nose, so
I'll take a picture of this.

145
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,420
If you're going to take a picture,
it's better to take a picture of a girl.

146
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,770
What do you want to do today? Fireworks?

147
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,870
If it doesn't rain, fireworks are good.

148
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,290
I want to go to the pool.

149
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,630
Did you all bring your swimsuits?

150
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,690
I saw it earlier.

151
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,490
I want to see it.

152
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,730
I told you!

153
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,390
To communicate with everyone,

154
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,950
you need to be naked, right?

155
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,350
No, I'm not naked.

156
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,170
Your swimsuit is almost naked, too.

157
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,230
You need to wear a swimsuit because
you're dating a man and a woman.

158
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,150
I see, I see.

159
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,170
If you say you're naked,

160
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,050
I don't know what to say to the company.

161
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,750
I'll be in trouble.

162
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,210
Wow, wow, wow.

163
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,110
Oh, it looks delicious.

164
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,310
Oh, it looks really good.

165
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
They're talking.

166
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm taking a picture of
you while you're eating.

167
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,150
Thank you.

168
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,890
I'm so happy.

169
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,370
There's nothing in the camera.

170
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,450
I'll take a picture of you.

171
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,850
Thank you.

172
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,330
You're so cute.

173
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,450
You're so cute.

174
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,970
A girl is eating meat.

175
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,950
I'll bring more later.

176
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,150
I'll put it here.

177
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:01,311
It's a bit late, so let's go.

178
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,810
1, 2, I'll get you some chopsticks.

179
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,630
They are working hard.

180
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,510
I'll get you some garbage.

181
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,850
Garbage of the bag.

182
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,010
Here you are.

183
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,050
Thank you.

184
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,051
Thank you.

185
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,410
It's OK.

186
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,570
Let's eat.

187
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,710
Wow, the meat is amazing.

188
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,350
Awesome.

189
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,170
Yuzuru is cool.

190
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,830
Cool.

191
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,890
It's big!

192
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,590
Please eat first.

193
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,610
It's good! It's rare.

194
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,250


195
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,410
Isn't it rare?

196
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,110
Isn't it rare in this thickness?

197
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,030
It's okay because it's beef.

198
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,250
I'll take a picture of you
eating, so please eat deliciously.

199
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,030
Please report.

200
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,470
Let's eat.

201
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,530
It's so fatty.

202
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,850
Look at this.

203
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,270
It's like Jojoen.

204
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,270
Isn't it good? It's good.

205
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,250


206
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,830
It's good? That's good.

207
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,130


208
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,150
Next report, please.

209
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,030
Let's eat.

210
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,330
It's full of meat juice.

211
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,090
We are going to have a bite.

212
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,630
Is it good? Yes, it is.

213
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,330
It's good.

214
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,470


215
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,250
Is it good?

216
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,390
What is it? I don't know.

217
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,670


218
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,830
Is it good? Yes, it is.

219
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,630


220
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,290
By the way, your face is on the video.

221
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,690
It's on the video.

222
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,170
I'll edit it later.

223
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,210
Thank you for the meal.

224
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,730
Do you have salt?

225
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,250
Do I have salt, too?

226
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:54,910
Don't you do it? Yes, I do.

227
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,730


228
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,890
Thank you for the meal.

229
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,210
It's good.

230
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,850
Is it good?

231
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,470
Yes.

232
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,471
That's good.

233
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,510
Thank you for the meal.

234
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,990
I'm not good at it.

235
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,630
Which one is my sake? It's good.

236
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,270


237
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,650
This one?

238
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,730
I don't know what it is.

239
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,010
I don't know what kind of sake it is.

240
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,490
I'm hungry.

241
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,850
You are eating together.

242
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,490
It's good.

243
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,470
It's a good atmosphere.

244
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,970
Yuzuru is a professional cook.

245
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,510
He can do anything.

246
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,430
I wish I had a boyfriend like him.

247
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,630
Are you aiming at Yuzuru?

248
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,406
Yuzuru-san, you are being targeted.
What are you going to do?

249
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,970
Are you being targeted?

250
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:53,850
You are being targeted.

251
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,650
Don't do that. It's embarrassing.

252
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,870
What are you talking about?

253
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,770
Don't talk about me in such an erotic way.

254
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,050
You are talking about
me in such an erotic way.

255
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,770
Our company doesn't
want such communication.

256
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,430
It's not good to be erotic.

257
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,370
This is an indoor building.

258
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
That's right.

259
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,810
Oh!

260
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,550
Welcome!

261
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,550
You look great!

262
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,150
You look great!

263
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,060
Can I take a picture with you?

264
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Can I? I don't mind.

265
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,430


266
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,250
First, can you take a pose like a model?

267
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,650
Do you want to go over there?

268
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,930
Let's take a picture.

269
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,950
You can ride on the top.

270
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,780
What?

271
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
What did you do?

272
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,640
Yes.

273
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,220
What did you do?

274
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Yes.

275
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,400
It's hot.

276
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
It looks good on you.

277
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,236
Irita-san, don't you take
off your clothes? I don't.

278
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260


279
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,260
I'll take off my clothes.

280
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
You can do it.

281
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
You can do it.

282
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,800
You look like a model.

283
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,360
You look like a model.

284
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,140
You look like a model.

285
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:40,400
Let's take a picture together.

286
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,940
Let's take a picture together.

287
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,260
Let's take a picture together.

288
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,940
Wow! Awesome!

289
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,085
Look at the boys. They are awesome.

290
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,780
Take a picture.

291
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,680
Wow, amazing!

292
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,175
It's really beautiful, isn't it?

293
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

294
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
It's too fast.

295
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,240
Wow, it's getting excited.

296
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,120
It's coming because I called it.

297
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,976
It's coming because you called it.

298
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't say it's my fault.

299
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,200
It's nice, but it's amazing!

300
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,120
It suits you very much, Irita-san.

301
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,460
I'm sorry, but how can I
take a picture like a gravure?

302
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,880
I don't know at all.

303
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,020
You have to take a pose.

304
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,220
Like this.

305
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,261
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a thing.

306
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,420
Wow!

307
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
It's moving!

308
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,280
It's moving!

309
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,281
Can I ride it? Yes, you can.

310
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,840
Wow! Thank you.

311
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800


312
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,420
Can you show me your back? Sure.

313
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,560


314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,120
I'll take care of all three of you.

315
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,516
I'll take care of all three of you.

316
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,920
Thank you.

317
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,160
A little more, a little more.

318
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,920
OK, OK, OK.

319
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,140
OK, three of you...

320
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,560
OK, three of you, please turn around.

321
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,540
Me? Oh, OK, OK.

322
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,860


323
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,620
I didn't notice anything.

324
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,560
Oh, good, good.

325
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
Wait a minute.

326
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Wait a minute.

327
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,140
It's like a competition.

328
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,580
Don't fall.

329
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,560
It's a video, so don't fall.

330
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:26,020
It's a video, so don't fall.

331
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,860
It's a pool, so don't fall.

332
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,040
Erita, I'm sorry.

333
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
I wasn't wrong.

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,940
Is it the other way around?

335
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,500
I feel like I can see half of my butt.

336
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
What should I do? I don't know.

337
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,160


338
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,100
I don't know, either.

339
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I don't know.

340
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,540
Girls, check it out.

341
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,040
Don't you see half of your butt?

342
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,700
I really want to see it.

343
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,100
I have to check it out now.

344
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,400
Is it right?

345
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Is it right?

346
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
There may be a tag in front.

347
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,060
There may be a tag in front.

348
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
I can see half of it.

349
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm a little bit confused.

350
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm sure that there is a half-butt.

351
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
What's wrong? Wait a minute.

352
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm not sure.

353
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,521
What's wrong? I'm not sure.

354
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,340
Don't lie.

355
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,100


356
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,020
Take a photo and show me.

357
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm not sure.

358
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,361
I'm telling the truth.

359
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,580
You are telling
the truth? Don't lie.

360
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm not sure.

361
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920


362
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,160
You should check it.

363
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
I'm not sure.

364
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,940
You should worry about it.

365
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:19,228
I'm a little worried if I don't
take a picture, but I'm a

366
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,781
little worried if the crack in
the butt is a bit of a good day.

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,020
I'll take a picture of this only.

368
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,380
I'll take a picture of this only.

369
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,020
I'll take a picture of this only.

370
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:33,020
It may be such a design.

371
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
I'm a little embarrassed.

372
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Which one is this?

373
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,180
But it looks good on you.

374
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,000
That's all for Rita's swimsuit question.

375
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,140
Thank you very much.

376
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
I'll give you money later.

377
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Money?

378
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Is it paid?

379
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,820
I'm a delivery man.

380
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
There's a lot of meat.

381
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,220
Please eat it with meat and sake.

382
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,120
I want an uwagi.

383
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,140
What's wrong with the uwagi?

384
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,900
The boy took the uwagi.

385
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:05,900
There are many fish here.

386
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:08,480
Yes, yes, yes, come here.

387
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,920
Oh, you are good.

388
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
You are the leader.

389
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
It's delicious.

390
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Let's eat.

391
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Let's eat.

392
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
What? He ran away.

393
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080


394
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Is the wine ok?

395
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,120
Do you think you can
steal the wine? No, I don't.

396
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020


397
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,080
Do you want to open the wine?

398
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,760
I'll give it to you.

399
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,400
Thank you.

400
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,240
What do you want to drink?

401
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,500
Do you want to drink wine?

402
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,180
Actually, we were
selected as a project team.

403
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:50,800
Really?

404
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Are you still going? Stop it.

405
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,340
It's annoying.

406
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540


407
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,740
Your way of speaking.

408
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,180
Is there something in it?

409
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:00,420
We are going to drink this.

410
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:01,421
Is it a bug?

411
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,720
I don't drink this.

412
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
I don't drink this.

413
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,260
I get drunk easily.

414
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,080
This is the most beautiful color.

415
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
It's easy to get drunk.

416
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,800
Champagne is also good.

417
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
I can't mix it.

418
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,560
I was surprised.

419
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,080
I'll drink it.

420
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,225
It's delicious.

421
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,440
It goes well with meat.

422
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,400
Are you communicating properly?

423
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,300
It's a rare opportunity.

424
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,160
It's very delicious.

425
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,000
You can eat the meat.

426
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
It's well-done.

427
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,080
You can eat it.

428
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,620
I have chopsticks.

429
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,780
You don't eat it?

430
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,500
Do you want to
eat it? Thank you.

431
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,160
It's well-done.

432
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:50,360


433
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm pretty drunk.

434
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm easy to get drunk.

435
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,240
Thank you for the meal.

436
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,900
We're going to play a team building
game to improve our teamwork.

437
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:12,901
I think.

438
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,020
The first one is a Shiri-moji
that Yuzuru-kun suggested.

439
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,360
We, the ladies, will
write Shiri-moji in order.

440
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Please cooperate.

441
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,590
Then, Mami-san, please.

442
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,850
Me?

443
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,250
Yes.

444
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:42,251
Oh!

445
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,450
I'm so excited!

446
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,510
You look so cool!

447
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,090
Can you express your feelings with
the characters you want to convey?

448
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,970
The theme is your
feelings you want to convey.

449
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,290
Feelings I want to convey?

450
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,910
Do you know that?

451
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,531
If there are so many
characters, it's a bit... I see.

452
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,670
Please come this way.

453
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,170
Please show your butts to everyone.

454
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,930
How many
characters? I'm curious.

455
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,150
I'm curious.

456
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,590


457
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,770
No hint?

458
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,950
It's a number of characters.

459
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,790
Can I start with how
many characters? Sure.

460
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,110


461
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll start with 4 characters.

462
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,670
4 characters.

463
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,510
I'll start with 4 characters.

464
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,610
I want you to raise
your hand a little more.

465
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,230
I can't see it.

466
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,630
You have to convey it properly.

467
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,170
It's easy to read.

468
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,090
I can't communicate with you.

469
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,110
I'll do it.

470
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,910
I'll do it.

471
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,370
1 Wait a minute.

472
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,950
First stroke,

473
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
2nd stroke,

474
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
3rd stroke,

475
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,170
4th stroke,

476
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,650
5th stroke,

477
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,990
6th stroke,

478
00:24:29,755 --> 00:24:31,310
and the last one,

479
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,350
5-5

480
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:36,351
Yes!

481
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,730
I got it!

482
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,630
Yuzuru-san?

483
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,830
I got it!

484
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,890
Can I guess? Yes, you can.

485
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070


486
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,550
Fun?

487
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,070
Correct!

488
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,750
Oh!

489
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,270
Can I give a reward to
the person who got it right?

490
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,230
That's not good.

491
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,990
But is it okay?

492
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,430
Yes, yes, yes!

493
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,390
What do you want to do?

494
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,410
What are you doing?

495
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:09,490
What do you want to do?

496
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,050
What are you doing?

497
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,730
Stand up! Stand up! I'm scared.

498
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,890


499
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,910
How do you feel?

500
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,590
How do you feel?

501
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,170
Amazing!

502
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,570
How was it?

503
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,950
Thank you very much.

504
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,830
Next, which one do you choose?

505
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,010
Is it a style to give up from juniors?

506
00:25:57,011 --> 00:25:58,011
You guys are watching?

507
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,090
Yes.

508
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,310
It's like a team building, but it's
like you're watching the seniors.

509
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,050
It's like a team work.

510
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,270
Oh, it's a team work.

511
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,090
It's like team building.

512
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,170
Oh, yeah.

513
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,930
Let's look at the ones in the upper part.

514
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,850
You can read it.

515
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,110
Okay.

516
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,050
You're so cute.

517
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,450
I'm so shy.

518
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,210
I want to do this.

519
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,990
Yeah, you're so cute.

520
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,690
Why are you all dead?

521
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,050
I'm wondering if it's now or now.

522
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,090
Is it the same? It's the same.

523
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,530


524
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,210
In four letters.

525
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,210
Is it fun?

526
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,830
No.

527
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
Here we go.

528
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,110
The first letter.

529
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,830
Oh, I got it.

530
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,570
Can I try flying? No? Oh, wait.

531
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,570
I got it.

532
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,870
I got it.

533
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,450


534
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,810


535
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,190
I think I got it, too.

536
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,730
I'll start.

537
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,590
The third character.

538
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,930
1, 2, 3.

539
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,110
I made a mistake.

540
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Something is wrong.

541
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,070
The third character.

542
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,030
I'm a magician, so I don't know anything.

543
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,770
The third character.

544
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,150
I'll start.

545
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,290
1, 2, 3.

546
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,430
Oh, you found out.

547
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,030
I don't know anything.

548
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,670
I don't know.

549
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,730
The fourth character.

550
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,370
I don't know.

551
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,380
The first one was
YASASHI-SAN? No, it wasn't.

552
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,150
Was it close?

553
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:33,690
The first letter was shorter.

554
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,290
Yes, it was.

555
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,710
It was the feeling of the moment.

556
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,830
It was 4 letters.

557
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,670
And the last one was SA, right?

558
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,916
I think it was the 3rd
letter that started with C.

559
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,111
And the first one was...
It wasn't the 3rd letter.

560
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,610
It was the feeling of the moment.

561
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,390
It was the feeling of the moment.

562
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,116
The 3rd letter was
supposed to end with 2

563
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,110
strokes, but you tried to write
3 strokes, right? Oh, I see.

564
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,890
That's right.

565
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,930


566
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,210
The order was wrong.

567
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:55,990
That's right.

568
00:28:55,991 --> 00:29:05,170
I'm sorry, but I can't say that.

569
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,450
Can I ask you to do it again?

570
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,430
Is it possible?

571
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,670
If you can unite, anything is fine.

572
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,490
Let's measure the unity.

573
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,370
How many characters do you want?

574
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,810
The first character is...

575
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,710
1, 2, 3, 4.

576
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:30,970
Can I say it?

577
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,390
The fourth character is...

578
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:44,310
1, 2, 3, 4.

579
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,070
I think I got it.

580
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,730
Did you get it?

581
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,210
Are you sure? Yes, I am.

582
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,510
I think it's happiness.

583
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,370
Correct!

584
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Congratulations!

585
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,170
I didn't know it was happiness.

586
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,710
I didn't know it was happiness.

587
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,510
Well, what should I give you as a reward?

588
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,130
Should I bite you with my shoulders?

589
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,460
Can I have a drink with Asa-kun?

590
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,960
I can't drink it all of a sudden.

591
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,470
It's okay.

592
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,890
Because Ten's voice is
coming out, that's all I can do.

593
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,550
Can I have a drink with Asa-kun?

594
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,370
Look, over there.

596
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,890
Oh, he wants you to drink it.

597
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,410
He wants me to drink it?

598
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:22,870
He wants you to drink it.

599
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,150
It's the same as before, right?

600
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:25,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

601
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,470
Come over here.

602
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,510
Please do it where everyone can see you.

603
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,210
Okay, here I go.

604
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,630
Here I go.

605
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,870
Okay.

606
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,670
Wait, wait, wait.

607
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:37,230
What, what, what?

608
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,330
What are you doing?

609
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,710
Take a picture with the fish.

610
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:41,850
I want to take a picture.

611
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,170
I want to take a picture.

612
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:44,530
I can do it.

613
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,930
You can do it.

614
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,130
I can do it.

615
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,290
I can do it.

616
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,670
You did it.

617
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,110
Thank you.

618
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,450
Yoshi, you are very energetic.

619
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,250
You did it.

620
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,470
Thank you.

621
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,590
Thank you.

622
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:04,591
I'm happy.

623
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,430
I was just grilling meat.

624
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,830
Next is Irita.

625
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,690
I want to see it.

626
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,130
No, Irita is fine.

627
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,370
Why?

628
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,690
I don't want to see it.

629
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,430
I want to see the cute two of you.

630
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,160
No, I don't want to see it.

631
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,210
Even as a senior, I can't close my eyes.

632
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,991
And as a team, it's
a little... It's amazing.

633
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,650
It's been a while since I've seen it.

634
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,470
This is for the team.

635
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,310
Dai-chan is drunk, so
please leave him alone.

636
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,810
He likes beer.

637
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,770
He is drunk, so he may forget it.

638
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,970
But he is a junior, so he wants
to see his senior's coolness.

639
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,690
I want to see it.

640
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,260
Here you go, Aoya.

641
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,080
Thank you.

642
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,360
Thank you very much.

643
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,040
Are you going to take off
your clothes? Wait a minute.

644
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,080
I want to see your butt.

645
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
I want to see it.

646
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
I couldn't see it.

647
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
OK.

648
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,500
Take off your clothes.

649
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,300
What are you doing? It's OK.

650
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600


651
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,220
It's just my imagination.

652
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,880
Wait a minute.

653
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,800
Wait, wait.
Your swimsuit is in a big trouble.

654
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,920
First of all, your round eyes are amazing.

655
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
My eyes are fine.

656
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,280
We have the same eyes.

657
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
We have the same eyes.

658
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,380
Don't think this is Sekohara.

659
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,830
Your lower teeth are spilling a lot.

660
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Let's fix it.

661
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,480
Kohara, are you going to shave your head?

662
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,820
I'm not sure if I'm going to shave my
head, but I'm going to shave my head.

663
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,060
You're a strong senpai.

664
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,260
It's okay, it's okay.

665
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,340
Yuzuru Hanyu, do you have any topic?

666
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,320
It's hard to answer now.

667
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,200
You'll be embarrassed.

668
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,840
You'll want to go home.

669
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:01,480
Thank you very much.

670
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,320
Let's start with the first character.

671
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,200
This is embarrassing.

672
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,820
No, no, no.

673
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,460
I feel like I'm getting really excited.

674
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
Here we go.

675
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,140
Here's the second character.

676
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Oh, I got it.

677
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,820
That's amazing.

678
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,280
I got it.

679
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
That was fast.

680
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,661
Ok, let's start with the 3rd character.

681
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,530
I'm a little embarrassed.

682
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,170
Ok, the 4th character.

683
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,110
Ok, I got it.

684
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,560
Can I just listen to it?

685
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,560
If I say it, I'll be scolded.

686
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,001
I think it's a little bit difficult.

687
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Yes, you are a leader.

688
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Oh, I got it right.

689
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,800
What's the meaning of Mimiuchi?

690
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,940
I'm so glad I got it right.

691
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,980
You are so good at guessing.

692
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,891
If no one else could get it right, I
would have thought it was a good answer.

693
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,700
I know the 4th character,
but I don't know at all.

694
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,900
Let's all say it out loud.

695
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,720
What do you think the 1st character is?

696
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,240
The 1st character?

697
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,580
I know the 4th character.

698
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
What's the 4th letter?

699
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
Can I say it?

700
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,440
Yes.

701
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:38,540
I.

702
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Correct!

703
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I got it!

704
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,300
What?

705
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Like, I want to drink.

706
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,480
Correct!

707
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Wow!

708
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,220
How did you get it?

709
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,560
You stumbled on the 1st letter.

710
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,620
Dai-chan, give me a reward.

711
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:01,621
Come on, give me a drink.

712
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,340
What is it?

713
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
Give me a drink.

714
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Oh, it's a bottle.

715
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
It's a bottle.

716
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
It's amazing.

717
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
Isn't it too much?

718
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,900
Come on, come on.

719
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
Go forward, go forward.

720
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
It's okay.

721
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm fine.

722
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,080
Yes, yes, yes.

723
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,900
Stand sideways so that
everyone can see you.

724
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,780
That's right, that's right, that's right.

725
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Ah.

726
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,280
Do you want to do it at
a distance? That's right.

727
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,760
In the air.

728
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
That's right.

729
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,700


730
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,316
It's easy to understand
that you're drinking.

731
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,960
Look up and drink a little more.

732
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:30,220
It's going into my throat.

733
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,080
It's going into your throat?

734
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
It's good!

735
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,640
It's good!

736
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,440
It's good!

737
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
Do you want more? Yes, yes, yes.

738
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
Give it to him.

739
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260


740
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,391
You shouldn't eat it in a weird way.

741
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:47,880
That's true.

742
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,596
You shouldn't eat it in a weird way.

743
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I'm surprised.

744
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm full.

745
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,340
I'm hungry.

746
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,880
It's delicious, but I'm getting sick of it.

747
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,600
Let's give a round of applause to
the women who played the game.

748
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,520
Let's get started.

749
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,191
What was the name of
the game? I don't know.

750
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,941
What's that?

751
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,360
I'll do my best.

752
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,080
Right hand, green.

753
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,880
At first, it's like that.

754
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,340
I can't do it.

755
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:38,420
Why?

756
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:39,541
Why are you coming
this way? I'm coming.

757
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,400


758
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
Do you cross suddenly?

759
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,500
Yui-san, Yui-san.

760
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:43,780
What?

761
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,020
Did you bring something extra?

762
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Again? You're so hot.

763
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
You're so hot.

764
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,880
You're so hot.

765
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,960
You're so hot.

766
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Yes, yes, yes.

767
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,580
That's right.

768
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,220
That's right.

769
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,840


770
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm going to go here.

771
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:57,601
I'm going to go here.

772
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Left foot, blue.

773
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,840
Left foot, blue.

774
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:02,500
It's far.

775
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,020
It's far.

776
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm the leader.

777
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,340
Are you okay?

778
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
Are you okay?

779
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,240
You can choose your right foot freely.

780
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,740
Right foot, wide.

781
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Wide? Oh, free.

782
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,700


783
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not up to the person who does it.

784
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,510
No, I can decide.

785
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
I see.

786
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,520
It's difficult.

787
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:22,980
Isn't it small?

788
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Isn't it small?

789
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,820
No, it's not that big.

790
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,540
Left hand, green.

791
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,820
Left hand, green.

792
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,361
Well, this is...
Oh, it's crossed.

793
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,131
It's getting closer and closer.

794
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
It's getting closer.

795
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,620
Left foot, red.

796
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,720
Right hand, blue.

797
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,480
You went to a bad place.

798
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Left hand.

799
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,440
Left hand, blue.

800
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,920
Left hand, blue.

801
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Oh, it's over.

802
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,420
Good.

803
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
Hey, wait, look at me.

804
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
No, no, no.

805
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,260
Right foot.

806
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Right foot? Right foot.

807
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,321
It's OK.

808
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,490


809
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,850
Are you OK?

810
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,420
The right hand, green.

811
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Oh, you are right-handed.

812
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Wait a minute.

813
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,280
Oh, great.

814
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,240
It's difficult to put it in.

815
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:52,180
The direction of the
face is very important.

816
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,720
The face is... I'm
a little mistaken.

817
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:58,680
The left hand, yellow.

818
00:39:58,681 --> 00:39:59,681
Left foot, yellow.

819
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,140
Left hand, green.

820
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Wow!

821
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,340
Did you do it?

822
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:15,341
Did you do it,
Irita-san? I did it.

823
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,020
You are experienced,
right? My experience.

824
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100


825
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,020
You are so good at it.

826
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,660
It's not my experience.

827
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,040
You are so good at it.

828
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
You are playing with me.

829
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
No, no, no.

830
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:24,501
Next, please.

831
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,180
You are great.

832
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,200
Your left leg is yellow.

833
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,470
You are fast.

834
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
You are fast.

835
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,300
Your fins are different.

836
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,220
Your right hand is red.

837
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,040
My right hand is red?

838
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,041
Can you do it?

839
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,340
The left foot is also red.

840
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,620
Wait a minute.

841
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:57,920
It's on your butt.

842
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,540
Wait a minute.

843
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,740
It's quite close.

844
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,400
Are you OK?

845
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,800
You didn't do it on purpose,
did you? No, I didn't.

846
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,280


847
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,740
The left hand is red.

848
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,680
There are three reds.

849
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,680
The open red.

850
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
The open red?

851
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,860
It's the furthest.

852
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:26,861
This is it.

853
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
Can you kick it? No, you can't.

854
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,520


855
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,700
The leader has put it there.

856
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,640
This is the best one.

857
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,341
This is... No, give it to me.

858
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
He is kind.

859
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
He is kind.

860
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,440
Left foot, green.

861
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,440
Left foot, green.

862
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,180
This one.

863
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:54,181
Wow!

864
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,320
You look so cool!

865
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,260
Right foot, blue.

866
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,910
Right foot, blue.

867
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,500
This is tough.

868
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
This is impossible.

869
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,500
Girito, this is impossible.

870
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
Right foot, right foot.

871
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,880
Right foot, blue.

872
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Right foot, blue.

873
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,160
Right foot, blue.

874
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,890
Right foot, blue.

875
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,240
Right foot, blue.

876
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:32,241
Don't look at me.

877
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,900
Where is your hand?

878
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,100
Let's finish this.

879
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,380
I'm getting old.

880
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:54,660
Left hand, blue.

881
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,320
Left hand, blue.

882
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:58,321
Left hand, left hand.

883
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,876
You have to get in a good position first!

884
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,216
You have to get in a good position first!

885
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,700
Oh, great!

886
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,500
Wait a minute!

887
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,020
Hey!

888
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
You're going that way.

889
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,320
Are you okay?

890
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,180
I'm okay!

891
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
You're going that way.

892
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,120
You're going that way.

893
00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:11,560
Are you going to let me touch you?

894
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,236
Are you going to let me touch you?

895
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,656
Then, should I put my
hand over here? Oh, no.

896
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,020
Oh, no.

897
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,600


898
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
This is important.

899
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
This is better.

900
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
Here we go.

901
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,820
Left foot, blue.

902
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,500
This time, blue.

903
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:29,176
Ito-san, you are so strict.

904
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,020
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

905
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Don't give up.

906
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I won't.

907
00:43:36,515 --> 00:43:37,515
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,020
Out.

909
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:43,860
Sorry.

910
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,540
Out.

911
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,960
So, the winner of this game is Rina.

912
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,600
I thought I couldn't win.

913
00:43:56,445 --> 00:43:57,770
It was a fierce battle.

914
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,530
That was intense.

915
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,550
I feel like I can get a reward.

916
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,110
Of course, you can get a reward.

917
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,890
Then, I'll start with the view.

918
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,190
Oh, the view?

919
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,350
Then, do you want to drink?

920
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:11,850
Do you want to drink?

921
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,350
Do you want to share?

922
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,450
Do you want to share?

923
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:14,650
Do you want to share?

924
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,010
What do you mean by sharing?

925
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,330
Kissing is good,
isn't it? That's right.

926
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,350


927
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,630
Come on, kiss me.

928
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,610
I don't care about that kind of thing.

929
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:24,771
It has nothing to do with me.

930
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,790
It's a game.

931
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,806
Both of you are pilots, aren't you?

932
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,830
Then, I'm sorry.

933
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,390
I'm sorry, too.

934
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,730
I'm sorry, too.

935
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,830
It's all right.

936
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,890
What are you talking
about? It's all right.

937
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,490
What are you talking about?

938
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,010
What are you talking
about? It's all right.

939
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,450
It's a game.

940
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:51,710
If you want to see
it, you can see it.

941
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,890
If you want to see it, you can see it.

942
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:53,970
You can see it.

943
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:54,430
You can see it.

944
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,450
You can see it.

945
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:56,451
You can see it.

946
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,710
You can see it.

947
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,850
You can see it.

948
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:01,390
You can see it.

949
00:45:01,391 --> 00:45:01,550
You can see it.

950
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:01,630
You can see it.

951
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,710
You can see it.

952
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,490
You can see it.

953
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,310
You can see it.

954
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:10,370
You can see it.

955
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,850
You can see it.

956
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:18,670
You can see it.

957
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:20,090
Let's have a meeting.

958
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,530
A meeting?

959
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,370
Which one is better?

960
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,210
I'd like to see her laughing.

961
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,510
It depends on the situation.

962
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,690
If it goes well,

963
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,170
there's no contact.

964
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,350
She drops it.

965
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,670
That's interesting.

966
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,830
She drops it?

967
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,310
Like the one before.

968
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:42,770
Like the one before.

969
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,450
Like the one before.

970
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,930
It's up, so if it's too
far away, it won't go in.

971
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,130
Do you want to do it again?

972
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,310
The container has changed.

973
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,250
The container is just a mouth.

974
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,310
Wait a minute.

975
00:46:06,311 --> 00:46:09,230
You can't drink it all.

976
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,190
You can't drink it all.

977
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:12,450
I want to drink it.

978
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,970
You can't drink it all.

979
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:15,971
You can't.

980
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,230
You can't drink it all.

981
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:30,010
Hey, what are you doing?

982
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,190
Are you satisfied with the
game master? Yes, I am.

983
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,410
It was so manly.

984
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,090
It was so manly.

985
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,530
You look like a poisonous tree.

986
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,950
I felt like I was getting a heart attack.

987
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,530
I'll do it again.

988
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,410
I'll do it again.

989
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:49,850
I'll do it again.

990
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,870
You need a tissue.

991
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:52,990
Tissue?

992
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,390
Is it over? It's not.

993
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:53,870
Tissue.

994
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,710


995
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,130
It was so much fun.

996
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:00,131
We are drinking again.

997
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,990
We are getting drunk.

998
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:07,850
We are getting drunk.

999
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,010
We were drinking a lot.

1000
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,490
We were drinking too much.

1001
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,730
We were drinking too much.

1002
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,990
We were saying we wanted to drink.

1003
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:17,351
We were saying we wanted to drink.

1004
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,870
Do you want to change?

1005
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,310
I was thinking about it.

1006
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,650
It's beautiful.

1007
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,950
It's really thin.

1008
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,410
What's wrong?

1009
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,830
Both of you have big boobs.

1010
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,370
Do you envy me?

1011
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,650
What are you doing?

1012
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,510
I'm glad to hear that.

1013
00:47:43,475 --> 00:47:44,570
That's good.

1014
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,750
Three of us.

1015
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,170
What are you talking about?

1016
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,790
Let's change our clothes.

1017
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,070
It's really beautiful,
isn't it? I'm jealous.

1018
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:57,071


1019
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,390
If you say so, it's hard to take it off.

1020
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,590
Why? Please show me.

1021
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,310


1022
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,850
Is there a picture of me in the back?

1023
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,601
You're a little aggressive, aren't you?

1024
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,210
Do you always wear that kind of underwear?

1025
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,370
Do you always wear it with your husband?

1026
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,371
Are you doing it? Yes, I am.

1027
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,430


1028
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,290
You are quite straightforward.

1029
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,950
I don't remember being so straightforward.

1030
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,830
I'm a little embarrassed.

1031
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,170
I think men will be happy.

1032
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,410
Why are you hiding
it? Please show it.

1033
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,670


1034
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,390
There are only girls.

1035
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,010
I see.

1036
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,440
It's a little embarrassing.

1037
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,850
And there are only two of us.

1038
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,070
Don't worry.

1039
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,530
Let's go.

1040
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,130
Wait, wait, wait.

1041
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,710
I'm already wearing it.

1042
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,230
Oh, I see.

1043
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,990
It's a flower from the bottom.

1044
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,350
It was soft.

1045
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,620
I'm going to sleep.

1046
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,430
No, no, no.

1047
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:15,431
I like you!

1048
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,470
I like you the most!

1049
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,870
I'm a Noble when I sleep.

1050
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,430
Me, too.

1051
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,510
I'm a Noble, too.

1052
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,910
We are the same.

1053
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:35,630
You can sleep well.

1054
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,450
Your nails are cute.

1055
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:38,910
Thank you.

1056
00:49:40,115 --> 00:49:41,150
It's summer.

1057
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,350
I'm wearing clothes that
everyone wants to wear.

1058
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
We got on the plane.

1059
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,990
It's so hot.

1060
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,750
It's hard.

1061
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:58,970
I have to drink.

1062
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,730
I'm at home.

1063
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,990
What are you talking about?

1064
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:44,652
It is said that there
is a possibility that all

1065
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:52,103
of them will be able
to get a job in the future

1066
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,070
It's not funny.

1067
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:12,890
It's funny.

1068
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,590
It's funny.

1069
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:15,870
It's funny.

1070
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:16,370
It's funny.

1071
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,130
It's funny.

1072
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,490
It's funny.

1073
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,170
It's funny.

1074
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:22,670
It's funny.

1075
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:22,690
It's funny.

1076
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:23,090
It's funny.

1077
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,250
It's funny.

1078
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:24,970
It's funny.

1079
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,110
It's funny.

1080
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,110
It's funny.

1081
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:31,710
It's funny.

1082
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,110
It's funny.

1083
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:35,970
It's funny.

1084
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,086
I'm not sure if it's the same.

1085
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,530
I think she's married.

1086
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:46,290
I think it's important to have a
body touch and a good relationship.

1087
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,740
You're right.

1088
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,050
I'm not sure if it's the same.

1089
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,250
I'm not sure if it's the same.

1090
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,970
I'm doing this.

1091
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:38,290
I can't do this.

1092
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,520
I really like that face.

1093
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,180
From behind.

1094
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,340
I'm sorry.

1095
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,410
Hello? Oh, yeah.

1096
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,110
I got it.

1097
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:50,830
Yeah.

1098
01:18:50,831 --> 01:19:20,450


1099
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:12,000
This video is a derivative work of the
Tohoku Prefecture Tourism Promotion Agency.

1100
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:11,998
The video was shot in
the early morning of the last

1101
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:12,020
day of the Tohoku Prefecture
Tourism Promotion Agency.

1102
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:13,440
It's cold.

1103
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:26,090
I'm the only one who doesn't have hair.

1104
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:30,230
It's cold.

1105
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:34,490
It's fun.

1106
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,250
It's cold.

1107
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:42,770
Wait a minute.

1108
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:43,430
Wait a minute.

1109
01:20:43,431 --> 01:20:44,431
It's a hammer.

1110
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,300
What's this? It's a globe.

1111
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:02,780
It's a squid.

1112
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,020
It's cold.

1113
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,240
It's cold.

1114
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:18,860
It's cold.

1115
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,620
It's warm.

1116
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680


1117
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,640
Be careful, don't spill water on girls.

1118
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,340
It's scary.

1119
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,540
I'm getting used to this water temperature.

1120
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:48,160
I think so, too.

1121
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,360
It's fun.

1122
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,720
I want to do this.

1123
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:54,360
I want to do it, but I can't.

1124
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Do you support it?

1125
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:01,700
Me?

1126
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:12,540
Come here, girls.

1127
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,140
Let's have fun.

1128
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,141
It's cool, isn't it? Yes, it is.

1129
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,420


1130
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,020
But it feels good.

1131
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,600
The coolness of the pool
and the balance are good.

1132
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,260
Oh, it's been in the water for a while.

1133
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,520
Oh, it's a fish.

1134
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,400
It's a fish.

1135
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,740
It was a good fish.

1136
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,640
It looks like a jellyfish.

1137
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:37,740
Oh, it's embarrassing.

1138
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,620
Oh, it's hot.

1139
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,680
I got it.

1140
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:44,681
I got it.

1141
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,560
But I can't get down.

1142
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,820
I couldn't get down well.

1143
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,576
I'm the only one who can't get down.

1144
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,600
This is the balance.

1145
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,280
Wow!

1146
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:54,940
Eat it!

1147
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:55,140
Eat it!

1148
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,060
Eat it!

1149
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,260
Eat it!

1150
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,040
Tsubasa!

1151
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:00,860
Tsubasa!

1152
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,420
Tsubasa!

1153
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:02,720
Tsubasa!

1154
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:03,120
Tsubasa!

1155
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:03,780
Tsubasa!

1156
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,560
Tsubasa!

1157
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,880
Tsubasa!

1158
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,140
Tsubasa!

1159
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,540
Tsubasa!

1160
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,360
Tsubasa!

1161
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,380
Do you want to get off?

1162
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,560
Maya, you can get off.

1163
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,440
Can you get off?

1164
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,900
Can you get off? I'll get off.

1165
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:37,340
Don't get off the boat now.

1166
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,040
That was a good one.

1167
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,900
You can get off from the high place.

1168
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:51,420
Do you want to go from this side?

1169
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:56,200
Are you OK?

1170
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:08,650
Oh, there's a small one.

1171
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,220
Oh, it's fun.

1172
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:26,430
It matches well with Europe.

1173
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:31,730
That's great.

1174
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:41,490
This is the biggest one.

1175
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,390
You can throw it away.

1176
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:45,391
I'm drunk.

1177
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,000
I can't run away anymore.

1178
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,300
I was attacked.

1179
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:05,680
Everyone is teasing me.

1180
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:12,220
It's so bright.

1181
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,780
It's so fun.

1182
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:18,820
The water is so clear that you
can't see the bottom of the sea.

1183
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:27,640
The water is so clear that you
can't see the bottom of the sea.

1184
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:37,630
Don't you take a bath?

1185
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:45,930
I'll give you a shoulder massage.

1186
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:47,990
What? Take a bath.

1187
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,570
I can't.

1188
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:53,210
I'll be in the video.

1189
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:54,670
Don't worry. I have a ring.

1190
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:56,330
What do you mean?

1191
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:58,570
Your husband doesn't
worry, does he? Don't worry.

1192
01:26:58,571 --> 01:27:00,910
No, no, no.

1193
01:27:00,911 --> 01:27:01,911
Don't worry.

1194
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:04,070
I haven't told you in detail.

1195
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:34,060
I haven't told you in detail.

1196
01:27:34,061 --> 01:27:35,400
What if you have told me?

1197
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:36,980
What if I had seen it
yesterday? Well, that's.

1198
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,140
..

1199
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,100
It's just a coincidence.

1200
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,460
It's just a coincidence.

1201
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,860
I left it out yesterday.

1202
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,480
That's an accident.

1203
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,280
No, no.

1204
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,580
I'm accepting it.

1205
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,920
Why are you laughing?

1206
01:27:56,921 --> 01:27:58,940
So I don't think it's a good idea.

1207
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,580
What? Because you drank alcohol yesterday?

1208
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,660
Yes.

1209
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,260
I see.

1210
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,720
It was an accident.

1211
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:08,320
An accident.

1212
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,680
An accident.

1213
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,040
Maya, you drank alcohol.

1214
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,080
Is that okay?

1215
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,080
If you drank alcohol
and you became like that,

1216
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,320
take some pictures with this.

1217
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:50,120
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1218
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,376
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1219
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:51,880
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1220
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,620
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1221
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:54,500
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1222
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:54,900
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1223
01:28:54,901 --> 01:28:55,120
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1224
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:55,140
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1225
01:28:55,141 --> 01:28:55,200
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1226
01:28:55,201 --> 01:28:55,300
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1227
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:58,540
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1228
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:33,000
No, you don't have to
send it to my husband.

1229
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:41,890
Oh, it's hot!

1230
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,190
Oh, it's hot!

1231
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,610
It's the latest trend.

1232
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,150
Oh, can you hit it?

1233
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:53,750
Oh, leader!

1234
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:55,090
Leader!

1235
01:29:55,091 --> 01:29:56,091
Leader!

1236
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,550
Compliance!

1237
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:00,370
Compliance!

1238
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:03,130
Compliance doesn't matter!

1239
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,426
【Yukiyuki】I'm going
to get a slap in the face!

1240
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:13,530
【Yukiyuki】Maya, I heard that yesterday
you and Lee did something good.

1241
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,250
【Maya】What?

1242
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,410
【Lee】I heard that.

1243
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,750
【Maya】Why? Why did you do that?

1244
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:19,490
【Maya】I want to check that.

1245
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:20,250
【Maya】Why did you do that?

1246
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:21,730
【Yuki】I don't care about that.

1247
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:23,450
【Yuki】I don't know what happened.

1248
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:24,390
【Maya】What?

1249
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:24,510
【Maya】I don't know.

1250
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:25,550
【Yuki】What?

1251
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:26,870
【Yuki】I don't know.

1252
01:30:26,871 --> 01:30:28,050
【Yuki】What?

1253
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:28,630
【Yuki】What?

1254
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:29,210
【Yuki】What?

1255
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:31,130
【Yuki】What?

1256
01:30:31,131 --> 01:30:40,490
We're having so much fun today.

1257
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,910
We came here to play.

1258
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:41,970
Really?

1259
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:43,936
Why? Did you take
a selfie? Yes, we did.

1260
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:45,010


1261
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,150
Why did you take a selfie?

1262
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:48,750
We came here to play.

1263
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:50,230
Let's play with everyone.

1264
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:51,250
It's long.

1265
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:52,650
It's getting dark.

1266
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:53,390
It's getting dark.

1267
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,570
It's funny.

1268
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:56,690
What?

1269
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:57,130
What? What? We are.

1270
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:58,670


1271
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:00,390
..

1272
01:31:00,391 --> 01:31:00,570
It's OK.

1273
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,170
What?

1274
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:02,890
What?

1275
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:03,550
What?

1276
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:03,970
What?

1277
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:04,710
What?

1278
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:06,490
Do you want to do this?

1279
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:07,590
What?

1280
01:31:07,665 --> 01:31:14,930
It's good to be a part of
the team building, isn't it, Mr.

1281
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,990
Iita? This is called
team building.

1282
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,690
I don't know what it is.

1283
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:23,270
I think it's necessary to do
this to build a strong team.

1284
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:29,050
It's very soft.

1285
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:30,470
It's team building.

1286
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:32,670
Let me see.

1287
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:34,010
Wow!

1288
01:31:34,011 --> 01:31:35,011
Wow!

1289
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,430
Cool!

1290
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:44,330
Who? Who?

1291
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,850
It's the leader of the group.

1292
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:48,770
It's the same, isn't it?

1293
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:49,910
Leader?

1294
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,570
I'll try it, too.

1295
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,530
He said, let's play with everyone,
and we just came to call him.

1296
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,010
Yes, yes, yes.

1297
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,390
What?

1298
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,670
What?

1299
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:00,310
What?

1300
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:01,390
What?

1301
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:03,930
What's wrong?

1302
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,310
What? Wait a minute.

1303
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:06,550


1304
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:10,430
I don't want to be seen by everyone.

1305
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,666
You don't want to be seen
by everyone? No, I don't.

1306
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:15,010
You don't want to be seen
by everyone? No, I don't.

1307
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:16,710


1308
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:18,350
You don't want to be seen
by everyone? No, I don't.

1309
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:22,690
You don't want to
be seen by everyone?

1310
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:25,570
I don't want to be seen by everyone.

1311
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,830
I don't want to be seen by everyone.

1312
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:30,630
It's a battle.

1313
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:33,650
We have to be chased.

1314
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:35,650
We are the leaders.

1315
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,180
We are the team.

1316
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:39,910
It's discrimination.

1317
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:43,070
I'm being watched.

1318
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,490
It's too far.

1319
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:45,170
Isn't it?

1320
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:46,990
It's a great distance.

1321
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,730
You look comfortable,
don't you? We are a team.

1322
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:55,570


1323
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:59,010
It's a communication.

1324
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:01,910
What is the purpose of this time?

1325
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:03,350
To keep silent? It's good.

1326
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:08,390


1327
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:12,290
But it's bad to be seen by
everyone, so it's just a little moving.

1328
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,230
It's a very beautiful sound.

1329
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,790
You have a very good boobs.

1330
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:48,040
You are enjoying, aren't you?

1331
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,460
You should enjoy together.

1332
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,240
You can have a good memory.

1333
01:33:56,410 --> 01:34:05,060
It's been a while since I was drowning in
the pool. Do you know that? Yes, I know.

1334
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:05,780
That's right.

1335
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,820


1336
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,800
I feel like I'm drowning.

1337
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:11,980
I'm drowning.

1338
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,500
But you can move it by yourself.

1339
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,420
No, I can't.

1340
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:20,540
No, you can't.

1341
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,160
Then, I got it.

1342
01:34:23,161 --> 01:34:24,161
Did you get it? Yes, I did.

1343
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:25,800


1344
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,820
Let's go to a different place later.

1345
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,960
A different place?

1346
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:29,560
Can we go to a different place?

1347
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,220
Yes, let's go to a different place.

1348
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,900
Oh, that's a good idea.

1349
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,400
I'm looking forward to it.

1350
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,760
Let's go.

1351
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,080
Yes.

1352
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:54,390
He said no.

1353
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:57,070
Yes.

1354
01:34:57,395 --> 01:35:04,390
Tamae seems to be in a good mood.

1355
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,690
It's a team building.

1356
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,290
It's good, isn't it? It's good.

1357
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,350


1358
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:36,690
It's raining,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

1359
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:39,511
It's going to be exciting.

1360
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:48,510
It's no good.

1361
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,360
Is it really no good?

1362
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,290
It's not no good, is it?

1363
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,421
Your back is getting stiff.

1364
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:07,390
I feel so bad.

1365
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,710
Your eyes are getting bigger.

1366
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:19,590
It's embarrassing.

1367
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:22,410
It's so embarrassing.

1368
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,300
You look so great.

1369
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:26,830
You look so energetic.

1370
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:28,210
What?

1371
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:29,450
Wow.

1372
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:30,650
Wait a minute.

1373
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:32,210
And you are holding it normally.

1374
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:33,110
That's right.

1375
01:36:33,635 --> 01:36:34,370
I don't hate it at all.

1376
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:39,850
I want you to hold my hand.

1377
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:41,810
Of course.

1378
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,921
If I say I want you to hold my
hand, you will hold my hand.

1379
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:54,351
If I say I want you to hold my hand
directly, you will hold my hand directly.

1380
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:55,530
Oh, is that so?

1381
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:58,066
If I ask you to hold my
hand, you won't listen to me.

1382
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:59,090
You are mean.

1383
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:00,950
You are mean.

1384
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:02,111
I don't know what's going on.

1385
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:08,430
Is it OK? Yes, it's OK.

1386
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:10,550


1387
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,670
It's a little painful.

1388
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,750
Is it because of the
temperature? Yes, it is.

1389
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:19,310
It feels good.

1390
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:23,170


1391
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:51,090
You touch me a lot, don't you?

1392
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:57,270
Aren't you happy that I touch you so much?

1393
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:01,790
Are you happy?

1394
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:04,350
Are you acting? No, I'm not.

1395
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,310
I'm not happy.

1396
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,650


1397
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:26,700
I want you to kiss here, too.

1398
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:28,420
I want you to kiss here, too.

1399
01:38:28,421 --> 01:38:29,421
Good boy.

1400
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:36,480
Can I give you a treat?

1401
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:43,520
Open your mouth.

1402
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:53,960
Oh, my god.

1403
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,520
You are so cute!

1404
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:03,930
You are so gentle.

1405
01:39:07,695 --> 01:39:13,290
I want you to pet me.

1406
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:16,371
You are getting more and more fun.

1407
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,350
I want to pet you.

1408
01:39:18,525 --> 01:39:20,770
Do you like me?

1409
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:23,570
Then, please pet me.

1410
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:28,390
You are petting me.

1411
01:39:28,391 --> 01:39:29,490
I want you to lick me more.

1412
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:31,970
Are you OK?

1413
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:39,510
You are so soft.

1414
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:41,410
I can put my hand here.

1415
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,010
You are so soft.

1416
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:47,010
Oh, it feels good.

1417
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:48,750
Oh, no, no, no.

1418
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:50,510
You have a very good face.

1419
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:53,410
I want to take a picture of you.

1420
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:55,830
Soko-kun is looking at me.

1421
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:57,871
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a thing.

1422
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:06,430
It's so cute.

1423
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,750
Have you ever done this?

1424
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:17,950
No.

1425
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,400
No? Really?

1426
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,050
Let's start with this one.

1427
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,030
Here comes another one.

1428
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:26,450
What is it?

1429
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:29,371
If you don't know what to do, use number 3.

1430
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:30,570
It's a big deal.

1431
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:32,170
Don't look at it at once.

1432
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,910
Don't look at it at once?

1433
01:40:33,565 --> 01:40:35,130
Can you do it? Here it comes.

1434
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:37,810


1435
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:39,310
Is it hard?

1436
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,410
There is an order.

1437
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:49,250
That is very caring.

1438
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,960
She is a little bit
smaller than the others.

1439
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:02,740
She is looking this way.

1440
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,500
She is petting her.

1441
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,020
She is so good.

1442
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,440
She is petting in the middle.

1443
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,960
She is lonely.

1444
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,180
She is crying.

1445
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,440
I can pet her three times at the same time.

1446
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:17,880
It's like a real horse.

1447
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,660
It's like a real horse.

1448
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:25,640
I'd be happy if you could look at me.

1449
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,380
I'd be happy if you could look at me.

1450
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:27,980
It's a horse.

1451
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,940
I'll do it.

1452
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,100
Next.

1453
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,861
Next, I will change
the position of the face.

1454
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:57,760
He is scratching his face.

1455
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:59,280
He is scratching his face.

1456
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,440
He has a very good face.

1457
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:11,750
He has a very good face.

1458
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,200
He is enjoying it.

1459
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,700
He is enjoying it.

1460
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:17,340
Let's enjoy it.

1461
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,521
Oh, this height is... Oh, I see.

1462
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:23,060
This height means... I see.

1463
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:24,920
What do you mean? I mean.

1464
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:25,540
..

1465
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:26,581
I want you to attack here.

1466
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:30,170
Wow, it's so soft.

1467
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,560
I'll get stung.

1468
01:42:33,955 --> 01:42:35,396
Does it feel good to be rubbed here?

1469
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,220
Yes.

1470
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:37,000
It feels good.

1471
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,040
It feels good, doesn't
it? That's right.

1472
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:38,500


1473
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:39,600
Here?

1474
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,040
Here?

1475
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,240
Yes.

1476
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,301
――What kind of sandwich
do you eat? ――No I don't.

1477
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,840


1478
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,480
――I mean sandwich….

1479
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:58,560
――not sandwich, I also need it.

1480
01:42:58,735 --> 01:43:00,040
No, no, no.

1481
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,000
I'm going to do that, too.

1482
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,060
I'm going to do that, too.

1483
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,000
I'm going to do that, too.

1484
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:05,500
I'm going to do that, too.

1485
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:09,420
It feels good.

1486
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:12,980
What do I do? It's right.

1487
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,240


1488
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:16,800
Wow.

1489
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:18,180
Let me brush my teeth.

1490
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:30,320
I'm going to look at your teeth.

1491
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,340
He does everything I ask him to do.

1492
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,040
I know.

1493
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,440
It's embarrassing.

1494
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:38,840
Ah, it feels good.

1495
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,600
Is this right? Yes, it is.

1496
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,160
It feels good.

1497
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,960


1498
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:46,280
It feels good?

1499
01:43:46,281 --> 01:43:47,641
He looks like he's in a good mood.

1500
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,440
It's embarrassing.

1501
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:56,940
But he's excited.

1502
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:02,060
I can't wait to see it.

1503
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:04,820
Misaki is also looking forward to it.

1504
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,000
Oh, no.

1505
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,660
Let's switch.

1506
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:10,240
What? Let's switch.

1507
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:11,780
I'm sorry.

1508
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,640
Like this.

1509
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,300


1510
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:23,520
You are learning a lot.

1511
01:44:23,595 --> 01:44:24,836
You are so excited,
aren't you? I am.

1512
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,540
You are so excited.

1513
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:28,420
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1514
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:30,740
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1515
01:44:30,741 --> 01:44:31,260
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1516
01:44:31,261 --> 01:44:31,320
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1517
01:44:31,321 --> 01:44:31,500
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1518
01:44:31,501 --> 01:44:31,540
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1519
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,156
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1520
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:33,760
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1521
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:34,920
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1522
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,340
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1523
01:44:35,341 --> 01:44:36,556
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1524
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:38,020
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1525
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,760
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1526
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:40,800
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1527
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,216
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1528
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:42,940
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1529
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,040
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1530
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:52,800
Oh, I feel something from behind.

1531
01:44:52,801 --> 01:45:02,240
I'm going to take a picture of
the back of the baby's head.

1532
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:08,220
I'm going to take a picture of
the back of the baby's head.

1533
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,961
I'm going to take a picture of
the back of the baby's head.

1534
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,921
I'm going to take a picture of
the back of the baby's head.

1535
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,020
The buttocks are soft and comfortable.

1536
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,880
The buttocks are good, too.

1537
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:21,900
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

1538
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:24,180
It feels good.

1539
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,980


1540
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,660
I want to have a massage, too.

1541
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,200
Me, too.

1542
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:34,280
Yes, equally.

1543
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:48,590
What's this? Look at this.

1544
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:50,330
It's so cute.

1545
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:51,430


1546
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:52,850
It's a skin scrub.

1547
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:53,950
It smells good.

1548
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:56,170
It's nostalgic.

1549
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:57,150
Do you like it?

1550
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:58,050
Yes.

1551
01:45:58,530 --> 01:45:59,530
It's cute.

1552
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:02,790
It feels good.

1553
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,170
It's the best.

1554
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,540
Let's do it together here.

1555
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,460
What?

1556
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:17,820
Together? Yes, together.

1557
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:19,360
I'm sleepy.

1558
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,120
I'm sleepy.

1559
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:22,440
I don't know.

1560
01:46:22,441 --> 01:46:23,441
I don't care.

1561
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000


1562
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:44,050
I'm a little scared.

1563
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:46,270
I'm a little scared.

1564
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:48,130
I'm a little scared.

1565
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,030
I'm a little scared.

1566
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:01,700
Then, please lick me four times.

1567
01:47:01,701 --> 01:47:02,981
Then, please lick me four times.

1568
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,960
Then, please lick me four times.

1569
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:11,540
Then, please lick me four times.

1570
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:11,600
Then, please lick me four times.

1571
01:47:11,601 --> 01:47:11,880

01:47:11,881 --> 01:47:13,161
Then, please lick me four times.

1573
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:30,870
Then, please lick me four times.

1574
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:33,870
Rino's mother Mikan

1575
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:42,880
Rino's father Tama

1576
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,361
Rino's mother Tama
Rino's mother Mikan

1577
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,620
I'm going to get a IV drip.

1578
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:19,740
It's a good thing it's out.

1579
01:48:19,741 --> 01:48:34,920
Are you okay? It's out.

1580
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:40,310


1581
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:43,270
It was so good that it's out.

1582
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:45,230
What are you
doing? It's so good.

1583
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:46,830


1584
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,430
How did it taste?

1585
01:49:23,365 --> 01:49:25,680
It's okay, it's okay.

1586
01:49:33,195 --> 01:49:34,195
Can I leave it to you?

1587
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,520
No, I want to take a break.

1588
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:36,220
Why?

1589
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:37,900
You look like you're in a good mood.

1590
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,240
Oh, it feels good.

1591
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:51,020
Oh, that's crazy.

1592
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,560
It feels so good.

1593
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:16,260
It feels good.

1594
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,220
This is very delicious.

1595
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,220
This is also delicious.

1596
01:50:33,405 --> 01:50:34,580
Oh, no.

1597
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,120
It's about to come out.

1598
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,360
It's about to come out.

1599
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,580
It's too delicious.

1600
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:45,440
Oh, no.

1601
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,760
Oh, it's coming out.

1602
01:50:50,885 --> 01:51:01,300
Did it come out?

1603
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,640
It came out very well.

1604
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:04,720
Open your mouth.

1605
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:09,260
Oh, it fell off.

1606
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,180
Was it that bad?

1607
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:14,840
It was really bad.

1608
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,720
Because you ate a lot of meat.

1609
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,740
It was bad.

1610
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,520
I was shocked.

1611
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,400
Everyone said they felt good.

1612
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:36,211
The dirty building was a success.

1613
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:37,460
It's a secret.

1614
01:51:37,461 --> 01:51:37,920
Team building? Yeah.

1615
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,080
It's a secret.

1616
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:40,680


1617
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:41,580
What?

1618
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,800
I think it's better to keep it a secret.

1619
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,040
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.

1620
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:47,160
I didn't say that.

1621
01:52:11,675 --> 01:52:12,916
Does it feel good to be rubbed?

1622
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:14,770
Yes, it feels good.

1623
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:15,870
It feels good.

1624
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,590
What?

1625
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:39,240
What?

1626
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:39,620
What?

1627
01:52:39,621 --> 01:52:39,700
Why?

1628
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,400
I don't know why.

1629
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:51,460
Let's build a building.

1630
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:53,460
Yes, let's build a building.

1631
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,960
Let's continue.

1632
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,800
Is it okay to sit
here? Yes, it's okay.

1633
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,461
It's like a real fortune.

1634
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:09,360
I'm not used to it yet.

1635
01:53:09,361 --> 01:53:10,361
You are not used to it?

1636
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,640
Do you want a shower?

1637
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,401
I feel like a little while ago.

1638
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,220
Are you not dirty?

1639
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,120
I'm not dirty at all.

1640
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,640
I have never seen you so dirty.

1641
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,540
I've never seen it.

1642
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,760
You are amazing.

1643
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:31,160
What is this pot?

1644
01:53:31,161 --> 01:53:34,820
I want you to kiss me.

1645
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:37,960
This is the information of my teammates.

1646
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:41,600
Profile is important.

1647
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,120
H cup.

1648
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,200
What? It's a secret.

1649
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,340


1650
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:48,640
I've never heard of H cup.

1651
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:04,340
I'll kiss you.

1652
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,040
Wonderful.

1653
01:54:28,885 --> 01:54:30,090
He is kissing.

1654
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:48,910
What are you touching?

1655
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:53,630
You want to touch him.

1656
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:01,790
I wanted to kiss you again, but is it okay?

1657
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:21,560
Can I kiss you directly?

1658
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,680
Is it okay if I do it right away?

1659
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:34,040
You seem to like chocolate.

1660
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:37,891
You said you were happy to
be surrounded by chocolate.

1661
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,440
I'm happy.

1662
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:40,960
You said you were happy.

1663
01:55:42,025 --> 01:55:43,025
I'm happy to hear that.

1664
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,260
Really?

1665
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:45,540
Yes.

1666
01:56:12,730 --> 01:56:24,900
Tamae's mother, Riki, is
the oldest Riki in the world.

1667
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,100
Masachi-san, you are so strong.

1668
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:29,880
I know.

1669
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:40,850
Wow, you are shaking.

1670
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:45,470
Your face is so smooth.

1671
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:25,540
I'm scared.

1672
01:57:28,910 --> 01:57:30,340
There is no dirty place.

1673
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,560
Have you ever been
here? No, I haven't.

1674
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,320
You haven't? I'm glad.

1675
01:58:30,850 --> 01:58:32,050
She has a very good face.

1676
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,161
Why are you looking this way?

1677
01:58:41,790 --> 01:58:43,890
No, no, no!

1678
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,890
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

1679
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:03,370
It's going to be exposed.

1680
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:04,720
It's going to be exposed.

1681
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:08,260
What are you doing?

1682
01:59:08,261 --> 01:59:09,261
I want you to be quiet.

1683
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,420
I want you to be quiet.

1684
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:13,540
I won't speak.

1685
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:14,880
I won't speak.

1686
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,040
Let's do it again.

1687
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:17,920
Let's do it again.

1688
01:59:17,921 --> 01:59:19,220
Let's do it again.

1689
01:59:23,570 --> 01:59:27,140
It's okay if you feel better.

1690
01:59:27,141 --> 01:59:28,301
It's okay if you feel better.

1691
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,060
A little more.

1692
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:50,160
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1693
01:59:57,170 --> 01:59:59,570
Oh, it's so hot.

1694
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:02,530
I'm going.

1695
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:13,591
She can't hold her voice at all.

1696
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:14,660
I'm sorry.

1697
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,160
I'm sorry.

1698
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:20,220
I'm sorry.

1699
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:23,140
I'm sorry.

1700
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:24,420
I'm sorry.

1701
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:25,660
I'm sorry.

1702
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,200
I want you to feel better.

1703
02:00:28,201 --> 02:00:29,481
I want you to look at this side.

1704
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:47,140
Look at this side.

1705
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:50,520
It's so cute.

1706
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,000
Look at this side.

1707
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:59,220
Yes, yes, yes.

1708
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,881
I want you to eat something you like.

1709
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,260
What do you like?

1710
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:11,220
Can you see it well?

1711
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:12,500
Yes.

1712
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,380
Oh, that's why.

1713
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:16,080
It's a secret.

1714
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:17,680
It's a secret.

1715
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:27,441
Can I follow the face of Tsukino?

1716
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:29,470
Yes.

1717
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:44,240
Can you look this way?

1718
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:45,800
Can you lick this?

1719
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,100
Yes, look at me.

1720
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,420
Use your tongue a lot.

1721
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:06,900
It's taken well.

1722
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:09,560
What should I do with
this video? He is talking.

1723
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:27,710


1724
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:36,660
He likes to be licked.

1725
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,180
He is licking with his fingers.

1726
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,220
He hasn't eaten yet.

1727
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:46,760
He has to be licked properly.

1728
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:49,940
He is licking with his fingers.

1729
02:02:52,710 --> 02:02:53,840
He is licking his body.

1730
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,520
He is licking his body.

1731
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:58,520
I'll do my best.

1732
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:00,020
Do your best.

1733
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:01,960
This is also a test for the team.

1734
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:20,810
You can hear her voice.

1735
02:03:21,550 --> 02:03:23,570
You can bear it if you add more.

1736
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,560
Your eyes are getting bigger and bigger.

1737
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:44,020
This is it.

1738
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
That's it.

1739
02:03:52,890 --> 02:03:53,890
That's it.

1740
02:03:55,150 --> 02:03:56,150
That's it.

1741
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:24,600
He is the oldest son of our family.

1742
02:04:24,601 --> 02:04:25,801
He often goes to the bathroom.

1743
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:29,980
He is so sleepy.

1744
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,160
He is so sleepy.

1745
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:37,300
He doesn't get up.

1746
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,100
He doesn't get up.

1747
02:04:39,101 --> 02:04:40,101
He didn't notice it.

1748
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,740
He didn't notice it.

1749
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:44,180
I wanted you to do it.

1750
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:45,720
Let's do it comfortably.

1751
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:56,720
Look at the camera.

1752
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:00,700
Here?

1753
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:23,640
Eiku!

1754
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:25,400
Eiku!

1755
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:28,580
Let's go!

1756
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:37,050
Tama Zoo, Chimpanzee I'm sorry.

1757
02:07:37,220 --> 02:08:04,660
It's okay.

1758
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:05,880
I'm sorry.

1759
02:08:05,881 --> 02:08:07,160


1760
02:08:30,530 --> 02:09:10,800
Can you do this? It's painful.

1761
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:13,660


1762
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,700
Can you do this?

1763
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:18,420
Can you? It's painful.

1764
02:09:18,421 --> 02:09:21,260
She has not been
able to sleep at all.

1765
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:23,530
She is a good girl.

1766
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,760
How is her posture?

1767
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,120
She seems to have woken up.

1768
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:30,400
She is asleep.

1769
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:46,870
Let's check her posture.

1770
02:09:56,190 --> 02:10:00,490
I'm glad you've been
sleeping with me all the time.

1771
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:21,330
I'll have you open the door.

1772
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:23,390
Let's get on the bed.

1773
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:38,860
It's really good.

1774
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:42,740
Look this way.

1775
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,880
Look this way.

1776
02:10:55,560 --> 02:11:05,820
I'm sorry, I can't make a voice.

1777
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:25,300
I'm sorry, I can't make a voice.

1778
02:11:26,600 --> 02:12:07,420
Riki, who is the oldest, is the
first child of Riki and Fubuki.

1779
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:09,200
I'm sorry.

1780
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:11,840
You have to do that.

1781
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:13,380
You can't run away.

1782
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,000
I can't do that.

1783
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:18,640
I can't do that.

1784
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:24,940
I'm sorry.

1785
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,340
Don't cry.

1786
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,620
I'm sorry.

1787
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:46,760
I'm sorry.

1788
02:12:46,761 --> 02:12:47,761
Don't cry.

1789
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:49,260
Don't cry.

1790
02:13:25,570 --> 02:13:26,570
Come here.

1791
02:13:38,710 --> 02:14:04,540
You have a good face.

1792
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:06,380
You have a good face.

1793
02:14:06,381 --> 02:14:06,620
I'm sorry.

1794
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:08,080
I'm sorry.

1795
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:11,650
Fujita-san, you had a good face.

1796
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,441
I couldn't stand your voice at all.

1797
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:15,710
I couldn't stand it.

1798
02:16:15,711 --> 02:16:16,711
It hurts.

1799
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:22,410
Can I wash my
hands? Yes, please.

1800
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:24,700


1801
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:27,690
Let's wash your hands.

1802
02:16:30,630 --> 02:16:31,670
OK.

1803
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:43,350
Are you OK? Are you clean?

1804
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:45,350
It's not so bad.

1805
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:54,460
It's clean now.

1806
02:16:56,220 --> 02:17:00,420
It's clean now, so I'd
like to clean it up, too.

1807
02:17:02,210 --> 02:17:03,370
I'd like to clean it up, too.

1808
02:17:09,165 --> 02:17:10,440
She listens to me very well.

1809
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:15,340
She's looking at the camera over there.

1810
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:22,660
It may still be on.

1811

1814
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:15,160
Oh, my God.

1815

Oh, my God.

1816
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:34,440
Oh, my God.

1817
02:18:34,441 --> 02:18:35,441
You look fine.

1818
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:41,170
I'm about to throw up.

1819
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:43,080
I'm going to throw up.

1820
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:49,680
Let me see.

1821
02:19:13,970 --> 02:19:14,970
Wow.

1822
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:16,550
You threw up again.

1823
02:19:16,890 --> 02:19:17,890
I did.

1824
02:19:18,310 --> 02:19:20,230
You have a nice mouth.

1825
02:19:20,231 --> 02:19:22,870
I have to wash my hands.

1826
02:19:22,871 --> 02:19:23,871
I have to wash my hands.

1827
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:31,050
My mouth is so empty.

1828
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:35,270
I am sorry I am so full.

1829
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:37,910
Was it not bad? It was bad.

1830
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:39,990
It was bad.

1831
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:41,110
No way.

1832
02:19:42,330 --> 02:19:43,330
No way.

1833
02:19:43,810 --> 02:19:44,110


1834
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:45,330
What?

1835
02:20:34,530 --> 02:20:35,530
Hello?

1836
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:37,510
Honey,

1837
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:41,650
I'm going to be late today,

1838
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:45,150
so eat dinner first.

1839
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:47,510
What are you doing?

1840
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:50,190
I'm doing team building.

1841
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,990
I'm busy, so I'll hang up.

1842
02:20:57,640 --> 02:20:58,900
Team building?

1843
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:01,940
I can't do it anymore.

1844
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:02,760
I'm on the phone.

1845
02:21:02,761 --> 02:21:06,240
When I'm doing it, I do it like this.

1846
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:09,840
It's difficult.

1847
02:22:10,650 --> 02:22:12,390
Is this a swimsuit?
It's difficult.

1848
02:22:12,990 --> 02:22:14,030


1849
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:18,110
It looks good on you.

1850
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:20,590
I don't know if anyone can wear this.

1851
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:23,630
What are you talking about?

1852
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,080
What's in the back?

1853
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:26,630
I want to see it.

1854
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:27,710
What's in the
back? It's a string.

1855
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:30,650


1856
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:32,880
Yes, it's a string.

1857
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:34,090
It's a string.

1858
02:22:34,170 --> 02:22:35,170
It's embarrassing.

1859
02:22:35,510 --> 02:22:36,510
It's a string.

1860
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:39,310
It's a string.

1861
02:22:39,311 --> 02:22:39,450
It's a string.

1862
02:22:39,451 --> 02:22:39,470
It's a string.

1863
02:22:40,410 --> 02:22:41,110
It's a string.

1864
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:41,890
It's a string.

1865
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:43,250
It's a string.

1866
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:46,610
It's a string.

1867
02:22:47,210 --> 02:22:50,110
It's a string.

1868
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:51,526
It's a waste if you don't see it.

1869
02:22:51,550 --> 02:22:53,110
No, no, no.

1870
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:19,928
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1871
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:28,680
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1872
02:23:28,681 --> 02:23:30,460
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no He is looking at me.

1873
02:23:34,590 --> 02:23:35,780
You have a lot of pimples.

1874
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:39,860
You have a lot of pimples.

1875
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:41,640
You have a lot of pimples.

1876
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:47,280
You have a lot of
pimples on this side, too.

1877
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,060
It's amazing.

1878
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:14,540
The baby's posture has changed.

1879
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:32,940
Look at him.

1880
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,660
Good boy.

1881
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,680
He's so naughty.

1882
02:24:55,075 --> 02:24:56,570
How do you feel?

1883
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:17,390
You have a good expression.

1884
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:21,030
Are you enjoying?
It's wonderful.

1885
02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:26,190


1886
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:39,110
Are you OK?

1887
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:42,310
How do you feel?

1888
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:45,070
Are you OK? I'm sorry.

1889
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:12,800
I'm sorry.

1890
02:26:23,310 --> 02:26:24,310
I'm sorry.

1891
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:35,010
She is crying.

1892
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:05,260


1893
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:13,020
Please let her cry a little more.

1894
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:19,110
Come here.

1895
02:27:24,015 --> 02:27:25,620
Where do you want me to pat you? Here?

1896
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:27,360
Here?

1897
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:29,380
You can do it!

1898
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:31,240
Can you hold her hip?

1899
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,040
What?

1900
02:27:39,470 --> 02:27:40,470
What is it?

1901
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:46,500
What?

1902
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:57,140
When did you get here?

1903
02:27:57,660 --> 02:27:58,740
What happened?

1904
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:05,640
Hey, Prince!

1905
02:28:49,140 --> 02:28:52,210
I love you.

1906
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:03,090
I love you.

1907
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:04,570
I love you.

1908
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:18,350
I'm going to go.

1909
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:23,880
She ran away.

1910
02:30:53,730 --> 02:30:56,090
If you don't attack her a
little, she will attack you soon.

1911
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,920
Good girl.

1912
02:31:22,820 --> 02:31:25,520
Which one do you like better?

1913
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:27,460
Which one do you like better?

1914
02:31:28,785 --> 02:31:30,580
Tell me which one you like better.

1915
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:50,880
You have a good expression.

1916
02:31:51,900 --> 02:31:52,980
You have a good expression.

1917
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:59,620
You have a good expression.

1918
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:07,140
Are you okay?

1919
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:11,500
Hi-chan Hi-chan

1920
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:13,020
Hi-chan

1921
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:28,300
The two of them are
getting used to each other.

1922
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:54,450
You can't do it anymore, can you?

1923
02:32:55,490 --> 02:32:56,490
What? It's hard.

1924
02:32:56,870 --> 02:32:58,110


1925
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,210
I want you to look at my face.

1926
02:33:01,510 --> 02:33:02,510
Are you ready?

1927
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:05,770
Yes.

1928
02:33:05,850 --> 02:33:17,380
I want you to look at my face.

1929
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:19,920
It's very hard.

1930
02:33:21,580 --> 02:33:22,580
Look at my face.

1931
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:25,420
Do you see that it's getting harder?

1932
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:27,240
Yes.

1933
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:43,126
This is the second day of
the cat's treatment, and I start

1934
02:33:43,138 --> 02:33:45,120
the treatment with a cat that
has been cured of his anemia.

1935
02:33:45,121 --> 02:33:45,280
I also treat a cat that has
been diagnosed with anemia.

1936
02:33:45,281 --> 02:33:46,920
Is it cold?

1937
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:19,560
Cameramen are so nice.

1938
02:34:20,450 --> 02:34:22,210
They work even though
we don't say anything.

1939
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:26,160
It's so quiet.

1940
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:32,690
Is it our turn?

1941
02:34:36,350 --> 02:34:39,050
I am so happy to hear that
you are having a good time.

1942
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:42,890
I feel so good.

1943
02:34:43,090 --> 02:34:46,280
I feel so good.

1944
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:48,960
I feel so good.

1945
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:50,380
I feel so good.

1946
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:50,980
May I hug you?

1947
02:34:51,580 --> 02:35:02,210
I'm going to give him a lot of food.

1948
02:35:02,211 --> 02:35:04,210
I want you to feed him a lot.

1949
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:14,320
It's okay.

1950
02:35:14,910 --> 02:35:16,070
It's not over yet.

1951
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:23,440
Keep feeding him.

1952
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:25,060
Raise your hips.

1953
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Don't lick him.

1954
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:44,800
I'm going to touch the back of his neck.

1955
02:35:44,801 --> 02:35:45,961
He's in the back of his neck.

1956
02:35:48,605 --> 02:36:01,640
I'll look at the back of his neck.

1957
02:36:10,285 --> 02:36:13,660
I'm going to have a bath.

1958
02:36:15,350 --> 02:36:19,880
Oh, my god.

1959
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,680
Oh, you're licking my nose.

1960
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:32,960
Kurita, do you feel
good? Yes, I do.

1961
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:34,060


1962
02:36:42,210 --> 02:36:43,400
You have a very good voice.

1963
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:16,290
I couldn't do it earlier,
so I'm going to do it now.

1964
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,520
I'm so excited.

1965
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:44,560
I can't do it.

1966
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:56,460
I can't do it.

1967
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,840
I'm sorry.

1968
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:46,740
Was it amazing? Yes, it was.

1969
02:39:47,630 --> 02:39:49,661
What was amazing?

1970
02:39:51,150 --> 02:39:54,020
My grandpa was amazing.

1971
02:39:56,500 --> 02:39:57,720
Was he? He was amazing.

1972
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:00,380


1973
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:02,600
Was he? Yes, he was.

1974
02:40:02,601 --> 02:40:06,420
How was he?

1975
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:08,960
He was like this.

1976
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,100
He was breathing.

1977
02:40:11,101 --> 02:40:12,260
I'm so sorry.

1978
02:40:15,070 --> 02:40:16,070
I'm so sorry.

1979
02:40:19,650 --> 02:40:21,700
She's moving a lot.

1980
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:23,200
She's moving too much.

1981
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:25,040
I'm sorry.

1982
02:40:33,070 --> 02:40:39,850
She's moving too much.

1983
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:37,170
The baby is crying.

1984
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:57,020
The baby is crying.

1985
02:41:58,220 --> 02:41:59,700
The baby is crying.

1986
02:42:00,090 --> 02:42:36,600
This is the first time I've
seen this kind of video.

1987
02:42:36,601 --> 02:42:36,780
I was surprised to see this video.

1988
02:42:36,955 --> 02:42:42,760
It's been a long time since
I've seen a video like this.

1989
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:51,960
I'm glad I'm not alone.

1990
02:42:55,720 --> 02:43:05,020
I'm sorry.

1991
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:06,680
I'm sorry.

1992
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:07,840
I'm sorry.

1993
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:11,680
I'm sorry.

1994
02:43:11,990 --> 02:43:22,340
Feel it.

1995
02:43:47,660 --> 02:43:52,670
I'm going to put the baby to sleep.

1996
02:43:52,810 --> 02:43:54,730
I put the baby to sleep.

1997
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:01,220
I'm going to put the baby to sleep.

1998
02:44:01,221 --> 02:44:02,421
I want to put it on your back.

1999
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:04,470
On my back?

2000
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:05,880
Yes.

2001
02:44:18,430 --> 02:44:19,470
It's really rubbing.

2002
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:35,280
It's good.

2003
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:37,180
Are you okay?

2004
02:44:37,181 --> 02:44:38,181
Does it feel good?

2005
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:45,380
I can't take it anymore.

2006
02:44:59,650 --> 02:45:00,650
I'm so tired.

2007
02:45:03,930 --> 02:45:04,930
I feel so good.

2008
02:45:05,690 --> 02:45:06,110
What?

2009
02:45:06,111 --> 02:45:06,510
Are you okay? I'm okay.

2010
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:07,250


2011
02:45:08,030 --> 02:45:09,030
Can I sit down?

2012
02:45:09,330 --> 02:45:10,550
It might be a little dirty.

2013
02:45:11,175 --> 02:45:14,770
It may be a little painful,
but it's a little dangerous.

2014
02:45:15,190 --> 02:45:16,670
I tried it and it was really painful.

2015
02:45:16,830 --> 02:45:18,450
Oh, don't suck so much.

2016
02:45:20,570 --> 02:45:21,730
It was really good.

2017
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:03,020
I'm going to go. I'm going to go.

2018
02:48:03,350 --> 02:48:05,850
I'm home.

2019
02:48:05,851 --> 02:48:07,970
Give it to me.

2020
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:32,830
It's so soft.

2021
02:48:43,410 --> 02:48:44,770
It's moving.

2022
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:51,910
Are you more satisfied than
your husband? Of course.

2023
02:48:56,360 --> 02:48:57,360
I'm home.

2024
02:49:04,190 --> 02:49:05,370
Welcome back.

2025
02:49:05,371 --> 02:49:06,371


2026
02:49:11,330 --> 02:49:13,380
You didn't touch my bag, did you?

2027
02:49:14,060 --> 02:49:15,060
No.

2028
02:49:17,450 --> 02:49:18,530
I'm going to take a shower.

2029
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Okay.
