1
0.05 --> 11.05
 I entered the university and joined the basketball club as a manager, and from tomorrow I will participate in the first training camp.

2
11.05 --> 13.05
 Did you get a little nervous?

3
13.05 --> 19.05
 Yeah. Thank you, Ko-chan. But I'm still nervous.

4
19.05 --> 25.05
 It's okay. It's only three days. It'll be over soon.

5
26.05 --> 30.05
 That's right. If you get through this, you'll be strong.

6
30.05 --> 35.05
 Certainly. I chose it myself, so if I do it to the end, I'll definitely be strong.

7
36.05 --> 41.13
 When you come back, let's go see a movie.

8
41.13 --> 43.13
 Really?

9
43.13 --> 48.13
 I'll get you the tickets to Agatha 2 that you wanted to see before.

10
48.13 --> 52.13
 I'm glad. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you.

11
53.13 --> 57.44
 Hey, Ko-chan. Do you like me?

12
58.44 --> 60.44
 I love you so much.

13
61.44 --> 65.44
 Yay! I feel like I can do my best at the training camp.

14
66.44 --> 69.44
 Then I'll give you a present.

15
72.82 --> 79.82
 And the person in front of me was my first boyfriend.

16
79.82 --> 83.09
 Thank you.

17
86.09 --> 91.09
 I was very happy. Until then...

18
100.50 --> 103.50
 It's a forest.

19
106.50 --> 107.50
 Isn't this amazing?

20
107.50 --> 109.50
 You're too excited.

21
109.50 --> 110.50
 Wait a minute.

22
112.50 --> 115.50
 Isn't this amazing? I don't think there's even a convenience store.

23
115.50 --> 116.50
 That's true.

24
116.50 --> 118.50
 What kind of level is this?

25
118.50 --> 119.50
 Of course.

26
119.50 --> 121.50
 I came to see you.

27
121.50 --> 123.50
 I'm not alone.

28
123.50 --> 126.50
 You don't do anything at night.

29
126.50 --> 128.50
 The fire is burning.

30
128.50 --> 130.50
 The fire is burning.

31
136.14 --> 137.14
 Ko-chan, you can't win.

32
137.14 --> 139.14
 What are you talking about?

33
139.14 --> 141.14
 I can't win.

34
141.14 --> 144.14
 That's why I came to the training camp.

35
144.14 --> 147.14
 I'm sure I'll win if I get lost.

36
147.14 --> 149.14
 Please support us.

37
151.90 --> 153.90
 Thank you.

38
153.90 --> 158.90
 I have to do my best to support everyone for three days from today.

39
158.90 --> 161.98
 Can you see it?

40
161.98 --> 172.34
 This training camp strengthens the muscles that are not strong enough.

41
172.34 --> 176.36
 It's a perfect body.

42
176.36 --> 178.36
 It's a training camp.

43
178.36 --> 182.80
 You need to train more than twice as much.

44
182.80 --> 186.80
 So at least play basketball.

45
186.80 --> 187.80
 I won't hear excuses.

46
187.80 --> 188.80
 Do you understand?

47
188.80 --> 189.80
 Yes.

48
190.80 --> 194.80
 But there's no goal here.

49
194.80 --> 196.80
 You don't understand.

50
196.80 --> 200.80
 This training camp is a training camp to build muscle strength and stamina.

51
200.80 --> 202.80
 I won't use the ball.

52
203.80 --> 207.37
 Do you understand?

53
207.37 --> 209.37
 Do you only have girls?

54
209.37 --> 211.37
 Yes.

55
212.37 --> 214.37
 Kiriya, tell me your enthusiasm.

56
214.37 --> 215.37
 Yes.

57
217.37 --> 223.37
 I will support everyone's health, schedule management, and massage.

58
223.37 --> 225.37
 Please use it without hesitation.

59
225.37 --> 227.37
 Thank you for today.

60
229.37 --> 231.37
 Let's start training.

61
231.37 --> 233.37
 First of all, let's warm up.

62
239.58 --> 242.58
 Kiriya, why are you spacing out?

63
242.58 --> 244.58
 Prepare a drink.

64
244.58 --> 246.58
 Yes, I understand.

65
246.58 --> 251.45
 Please.

66
251.45 --> 255.45
 This is how my first training camp started.

67
255.45 --> 256.45
 Next.

68
256.45 --> 259.45
 And it was after that day's practice.

69
260.45 --> 263.45
 Something like a nightmare happened.

70
263.45 --> 271.18
 I can't do this for three days.

71
273.18 --> 275.18
 There is no convenience store.

72
275.18 --> 277.18
 There are no girls.

73
278.18 --> 280.18
 This is hell.

74
280.18 --> 283.18
 I'm not in the army.

75
283.18 --> 285.18
 I want to go home.

76
286.18 --> 288.18
 Thank you for your hard work.

77
288.18 --> 289.18
 Thank you for your hard work.

78
289.18 --> 290.18
 Thank you for your hard work.

79
292.18 --> 293.18
 How is it?

80
296.18 --> 297.18
 I'm tired.

81
297.18 --> 298.18
 Thank you for your hard work.

82
299.18 --> 301.18
 I'm sweating.

83
302.18 --> 303.18
 Kiriya.

84
303.18 --> 304.18
 Yes.

85
304.18 --> 306.18
 You said you would support your parents.

86
306.18 --> 307.18
 Yes.

87
307.18 --> 309.18
 You said you would support your parents with all your might.

88
309.18 --> 311.18
 I said that.

89
311.18 --> 312.18
 I'm worried.

90
312.18 --> 315.18
 I don't know what I'm thinking.

91
316.18 --> 317.18
 I can't help it.

92
317.18 --> 319.18
 In such a mountainous area.

93
320.18 --> 322.18
 I have a lot of restrictions.

94
323.18 --> 324.18
 I can't help it.

95
325.18 --> 326.18
 That's right.

96
326.18 --> 327.18
 Is it okay?

97
327.18 --> 328.18
 It's okay.

98
328.18 --> 329.18
 That's right.

99
333.18 --> 334.18
 Thank you for your hard work.

100
336.18 --> 337.18
 I prepared a bath.

101
337.18 --> 339.18
 Please use it.

102
340.18 --> 341.18
 That's a good idea.

103
341.18 --> 342.18
 It's refreshing.

104
343.18 --> 344.18
 It's refreshing.

105
349.13 --> 351.13
 I'm sweating.

106
354.13 --> 357.14
 How about a bath?

107
358.14 --> 363.27
 Be quiet.

108
363.27 --> 364.27
 Be quiet.

109
364.27 --> 365.27
 Be quiet.

110
368.27 --> 370.27
 I have a lot of things to do.

111
370.27 --> 372.27
 Please take care of me.

112
373.27 --> 374.27
 Please take care of me.

113
374.27 --> 376.27
 I have a lot of things to do.

114
378.27 --> 381.27
 You said you would support your parents with all your might.

115
382.27 --> 383.27
 Please.

116
383.27 --> 384.27
 Please.

117
386.27 --> 387.27
 Be quiet.

118
387.27 --> 388.27
 Be quiet.

119
388.27 --> 389.27
 Thank you for your hard work.

120
389.27 --> 390.27
 YUUMA.

121
390.27 --> 391.27
 Keep an eye on her.

122
391.27 --> 392.27
 Keep an eye on her.

123
392.27 --> 393.27
 Thank you for your hard work.

124
394.27 --> 398.27
 If you find out about this, we won't be able to participate in the tournament.

125
399.27 --> 403.27
 If you don't say anything, nothing will happen.

126
405.27 --> 406.27
 Do you understand?

127
406.27 --> 414.51
 I can't control her.

128
415.51 --> 416.51
 She is big.

129
417.51 --> 418.51
 I understand.

130
432.14 --> 433.14
 Let's kiss.

131
433.14 --> 434.14
 Let's kiss.

132
437.14 --> 438.14
 You are so forceful.

133
439.14 --> 447.64
 You will support us with all your might.

134
450.64 --> 451.64
 I will support you.

135
451.64 --> 452.64
 I'm glad to hear that.

136
462.94 --> 463.94
 Please stop.

137
463.94 --> 464.94
 Be quiet.

138
464.94 --> 465.94
 Be quiet.

139
473.89 --> 474.89
 Someone, please help me.

140
474.89 --> 475.89
 Be quiet.

141
475.89 --> 476.89
 Be quiet.

142
476.89 --> 477.89
 Shut up.

143
479.89 --> 481.89
 You are big.

144
482.89 --> 483.89
 Be quiet.

145
485.89 --> 486.89
 Don't cry.

146
486.89 --> 487.89
 I don't want to see you cry.

147
488.89 --> 492.39
 We won't be able to participate in the tournament.

148
494.39 --> 496.39
 Do you want to ruin everyone's dream?

149
497.39 --> 498.39
 No?

150
498.39 --> 499.39
 No?

151
499.39 --> 502.39
 If you don't do anything, you will lose weight.

152
502.39 --> 504.39
 Maruko, calm down.

153
505.39 --> 506.39
 She is crying.

154
506.39 --> 507.39
 She is crying.

155
507.39 --> 508.39
 She is crying.

156
509.39 --> 510.39
 Don't disturb her.

157
510.39 --> 511.39
 Don't disturb her.

158
511.39 --> 512.39
 Don't disturb her.

159
514.39 --> 515.39
 Raise your hand.

160
515.39 --> 516.39
 You are hurt.

161
530.06 --> 531.06
 Don't disturb her.

162
531.06 --> 532.06
 Don't disturb her.

163
533.06 --> 534.06
 Don't disturb her.

164
539.06 --> 540.06
 Don't do that.

165
542.06 --> 543.06
 Don't be violent.

166
543.06 --> 545.06
 She is enjoying.

167
546.06 --> 547.06
 Don't do that.

168
570.17 --> 571.17
 Is it good?

169
579.17 --> 580.17
 Please stop.

170
813.37 --> 815.37
 You are a good girl.

171
826.09 --> 828.09
 Open your mouth.

172
829.09 --> 831.09
 Open your mouth.

173
852.26 --> 854.26
 Don't bite.

174
856.26 --> 867.57
 You are a good girl.

175
868.57 --> 870.57
 I'll wipe your mouth.

176
870.57 --> 872.57
 I'll wipe your butt.

177
874.57 --> 876.57
 I'm sorry.

178
893.98 --> 895.98
 I'll hurt you.

179
897.98 --> 905.71
 Hold her.

180
954.99 --> 964.06
 I'll hurt you.

181
964.06 --> 966.06
 I'll hurt you.

182
968.06 --> 970.06
 You don't want to get hurt, do you?

183
971.06 --> 973.06
 You don't want to get hurt, do you?

184
977.06 --> 979.06
 I'll be nice to you if you behave yourself.

185
994.65 --> 1000.39
 I'll be nice to you if you behave yourself.

186
1000.39 --> 1004.54
 Do you understand?

187
1014.54 --> 1016.54
 I'll lick your buttocks.

188
1017.54 --> 1019.54
 How does your buttocks taste?

189
1025.54 --> 1029.17
 Is it delicious?

190
1029.17 --> 1031.17
 It's delicious.

191
1031.17 --> 1041.39
 It's annoying.

192
1041.39 --> 1056.80
 It's very beautiful.

193
1056.80 --> 1058.80
 It's very beautiful.

194
1059.80 --> 1061.80
 You don't have hair.

195
1069.50 --> 1083.11
 You don't have hair.

196
1083.11 --> 1085.11
 You don't have hair.

197
1085.11 --> 1094.25
 You don't have hair.

198
1096.25 --> 1098.25
 This is our tradition.

199
1107.72 --> 1109.72
 I'll wipe your butt.

200
1109.72 --> 1111.72
 I'll wipe your butt.

201
1113.72 --> 1117.48
 You don't want to get hurt, do you?

202
1128.10 --> 1130.10
 I'll be nice to you if you behave yourself.

203
1133.61 --> 1135.61
 I'll be nice to you if you behave yourself.

204
1145.11 --> 1147.11
 Do you want me to kiss you?

205
1149.11 --> 1151.11
 Do you want to kiss me?

206
1151.11 --> 1153.11
 Do you want to kiss me?

207
1169.66 --> 1171.66
 Do you want to touch my buttocks so much?

208
1181.43 --> 1183.43
 Do you want to touch my buttocks so much?

209
1187.43 --> 1189.43
 I'll wipe your buttocks.

210
1189.43 --> 1191.43
 I'll wipe your buttocks.

211
1203.69 --> 1205.69
 I'll wipe your buttocks.

212
1211.77 --> 1217.83
 Do you feel good?

213
1217.83 --> 1219.83
 Do you feel good?

214
1221.83 --> 1223.83
 I thought you'd feel good.

215
1225.83 --> 1227.83
 I thought you'd feel good.

216
1227.83 --> 1229.83
 I thought you'd feel good.

217
1229.83 --> 1233.66
 Please show me your cute face.

218
1237.66 --> 1239.66
 Did you feel better today?

219
1239.66 --> 1241.66
 Did you feel better today?

220
1241.66 --> 1243.66
 Did you feel better today?

221
1243.66 --> 1251.13
 I felt great.

222
1251.13 --> 1253.13
 I felt great.

223
1255.13 --> 1257.13
 It's a good day today, isn't it?

224
1257.13 --> 1259.13
 Yes, it is.

225
1259.13 --> 1260.13
 Be quiet.

226
1260.13 --> 1263.13
 You have a finger in your mouth.

227
1263.13 --> 1266.13
 You have a gum in your mouth.

228
1274.70 --> 1275.70
 Do you feel good?

229
1275.70 --> 1277.70
 No, I don't.

230
1277.70 --> 1278.70
 You feel good, don't you?

231
1278.70 --> 1280.70
 Here.

232
1280.70 --> 1282.70
 Here.

233
1282.70 --> 1284.70
 No, I don't.

234
1284.70 --> 1285.70
 Don't cry.

235
1285.70 --> 1286.70
 I'll give you a kiss.

236
1286.70 --> 1293.66
 No, I don't.

237
1293.66 --> 1295.66
 I'll give you a kiss.

238
1314.39 --> 1316.39
 You have a very erotic voice.

239
1333.43 --> 1338.73
 You went away.

240
1338.73 --> 1340.73
 I'll give you a foot massage.

241
1344.73 --> 1346.73
 It's dangerous if you get a massage.

242
1354.16 --> 1356.16
 No, I don't.

243
1358.16 --> 1360.16
 Look at me.

244
1360.16 --> 1362.16
 No, I don't.

245
1364.54 --> 1366.54
 Look at me.

246
1366.54 --> 1368.54
 No, I don't.

247
1369.54 --> 1371.54
 We're friends.

248
1371.54 --> 1413.70
 No, I don't.

249
1414.70 --> 1429.69
 Did you cry a little?

250
1429.69 --> 1431.69
 I'll give you a foot massage.

251
1516.12 --> 1518.12
 Don't cry.

252
1520.12 --> 1522.12
 Don't look at me.

253
1528.12 --> 1530.12
 I'll give you a foot massage.

254
1530.12 --> 1532.12
 No, I don't.

255
1537.12 --> 1539.12
 Let me take care of you.

256
1539.12 --> 1540.12
 No, I won't.

257
1540.12 --> 1542.12
 Don't talk to me.

258
1697.99 --> 1699.99
 You are super strong.

259
1700.99 --> 1701.99
 1

260
1701.99 --> 1702.99
 2

261
1703.99 --> 1704.99
 3

262
1704.99 --> 1705.99
 4

263
1705.99 --> 1706.99
 5

264
1706.99 --> 1707.99
 6

265
1707.99 --> 1708.99
 7

266
1708.99 --> 1709.99
 8

267
1709.99 --> 1710.99
 9

268
1710.99 --> 1711.99
 10

269
1711.99 --> 1712.99
 11

270
1712.99 --> 1717.03
 12

271
1717.03 --> 1719.79
 13

272
1719.79 --> 1720.79
 14

273
1720.79 --> 1721.79
 15

274
1721.79 --> 1722.79
 16

275
1722.79 --> 1723.79
 17

276
1723.79 --> 1724.79
 18

277
1724.79 --> 1725.79
 19

278
1725.79 --> 1726.79
 20

279
1726.79 --> 1727.79
 21

280
1727.79 --> 1728.79
 22

281
1728.79 --> 1729.79
 23

282
1729.79 --> 1730.79
 24

283
1730.79 --> 1731.79
 25

284
1731.79 --> 1733.79
 You can talk now.

285
1733.79 --> 1735.79
 I can talk.

286
1735.79 --> 1736.79
 Can I?

287
1736.79 --> 1738.79
 I'm so nervous.

288
1738.79 --> 1739.79
 I know.

289
1740.79 --> 1742.79
 I'm nervous.

290
1743.79 --> 1745.79
 I'm so nervous.

291
1745.79 --> 1747.79
 I'm glad.

292
1747.79 --> 1748.79
 I'm nervous.

293
1748.79 --> 1749.79
 I can do it.

294
1749.79 --> 1751.79
 It's not easy.

295
1755.79 --> 1756.79
 Can you?

296
1756.79 --> 1758.79
 Don't make a sound.

297
1762.79 --> 1765.79
 Don't you know the position of your mouth?

298
1784.58 --> 1786.58
 It's not good for you to resist.

299
1787.58 --> 1790.58
 If you don't do it, you can't talk.

300
1792.58 --> 1793.58
 Go.

301
1795.58 --> 1797.58
 Don't make a sound.

302
1803.02 --> 1805.02
 Don't do it.

303
1810.58 --> 1811.58
 Don't do it.

304
1811.58 --> 1818.60
 I want you to feel good.

305
1819.60 --> 1821.60
 Don't make a sound.

306
1826.77 --> 1828.77
 Did you do it already?

307
1828.77 --> 1829.77
 No.

308
1829.77 --> 1831.77
 Please take it off.

309
1832.77 --> 1834.77
 Don't make a sound.

310
1835.77 --> 1836.77
 Don't put it in my mouth.

311
1836.77 --> 1838.77
 It's in your mouth.

312
1838.77 --> 1840.77
 It's okay.

313
1840.77 --> 1842.77
 It's okay.

314
1843.77 --> 1844.77
 Please take it off.

315
1844.77 --> 1845.77
 I don't know.

316
1845.77 --> 1846.77
 It's not in my mouth.

317
1846.77 --> 1847.77
 That's right.

318
1847.77 --> 1849.77
 It's not in your mouth.

319
1851.77 --> 1853.77
 I'll hold your hand.

320
1857.40 --> 1859.40
 You are a violent person.

321
1861.40 --> 1863.40
 I feel good.

322
1866.40 --> 1868.40
 I feel good.

323
1868.40 --> 1870.40
 Please change it later.

324
1871.40 --> 1873.40
 I feel good.

325
1875.40 --> 1877.40
 Don't do it.

326
1907.54 --> 1908.54
 I feel good.

327
1911.54 --> 1912.54
 I feel good.

328
1912.54 --> 1913.54
 I feel good.

329
1985.07 --> 1986.07
 I feel good.

330
1992.75 --> 1994.75
 Don't do it.

331
1994.75 --> 1996.75
 I'm here to support you.

332
1997.75 --> 2000.75
 I'm glad you came to work as a manager.

333
2002.75 --> 2003.75
 It's strange.

334
2004.75 --> 2007.75
 We are healed.

335
2029.80 --> 2031.80
 Don't make a loud voice.

336
2031.80 --> 2033.80
 I can't hear you.

337
2035.80 --> 2037.80
 It's strange.

338
2047.01 --> 2048.01
 It's okay.

339
2048.01 --> 2050.01
 It's in your mouth.

340
2050.01 --> 2051.01
 It's okay.

341
2053.01 --> 2054.01
 You are cute.

342
2055.01 --> 2058.32
 You are cute.

343
2060.32 --> 2064.53
 I feel good.

344
2081.05 --> 2089.16
 Don't do it.

345
2122.02 --> 2123.02
 It's okay.

346
2123.02 --> 2125.02
 I'll move this.

347
2125.02 --> 2126.02
 Can I do this?

348
2126.02 --> 2127.02
 No.

349
2164.86 --> 2166.86
 I'll put this in your mouth.

350
2166.86 --> 2167.86
 No.

351
2167.86 --> 2169.86
 I'll put this in your mouth.

352
2169.86 --> 2170.86
 No.

353
2198.47 --> 2200.47
 Listen to me.

354
2201.47 --> 2204.49
 Open your mouth.

355
2262.46 --> 2263.46
 Can I put this in your mouth?

356
2263.46 --> 2264.46
 Yes.

357
2266.46 --> 2267.46
 No.

358
2267.46 --> 2269.46
 Take this.

359
2272.46 --> 2275.46
 I'll clean your mouth.

360
2276.46 --> 2277.46
 It's your job as a manager.

361
2278.46 --> 2279.46
 Clean your mouth.

362
2286.46 --> 2303.82
 Don't do it.

363
2303.82 --> 2305.82
 I can't do it.

364
2306.82 --> 2307.82
 Don't do it.

365
2309.82 --> 2310.82
 I'll put this in your mouth.

366
2310.82 --> 2311.82
 Don't do it.

367
2316.92 --> 2317.92
 How do you feel?

368
2317.92 --> 2319.92
 I feel good.

369
2321.92 --> 2326.92
 Do you feel good?

370
2326.92 --> 2328.92
 Do you feel good?

371
2328.92 --> 2329.92
 Yes.

372
2331.92 --> 2333.92
 It's useful.

373
2334.92 --> 2336.92
 This massage feels good.

374
2358.48 --> 2360.48
 Do you feel good?

375
2360.48 --> 2362.48
 It's good, isn't it?

376
2362.48 --> 2364.48
 You are wet.

377
2365.48 --> 2367.48
 What are you hiding?

378
2367.48 --> 2369.48
 You're still wet.

379
2369.48 --> 2371.48
 You're still wet.

380
2371.48 --> 2373.48
 You feel good, don't you?

381
2376.48 --> 2377.48
 You feel good, don't you?

382
2377.48 --> 2386.58
 No!

383
2386.58 --> 2388.58
 Did he go?

384
2388.58 --> 2390.58
 Did he go?

385
2390.58 --> 2392.58
 He was trembling.

386
2392.58 --> 2394.58
 It's closed.

387
2394.58 --> 2396.58
 You can go.

388
2396.58 --> 2398.58
 Did he go?

389
2399.58 --> 2403.98
 No!

390
2408.61 --> 2410.61
 You can go.

391
2425.03 --> 2426.03
 You feel good, don't you?

392
2426.03 --> 2428.03
 Did he go?

393
2429.03 --> 2431.03
 Senpai, he's coming.

394
2431.03 --> 2433.03
 He's coming.

395
2433.03 --> 2435.03
 He's coming.

396
2435.03 --> 2437.03
 He's coming.

397
2437.03 --> 2439.03
 Support.

398
2439.03 --> 2441.03
 Support.

399
2441.03 --> 2443.03
 I'm sorry. I'll excuse myself.

400
2451.50 --> 2453.50
 How was it?

401
2453.50 --> 2455.50
 I was so nervous.

402
2459.50 --> 2461.50
 Let me see.

403
2464.50 --> 2466.50
 He's sweating a lot.

404
2466.50 --> 2468.50
 He's sweating a lot.

405
2468.50 --> 2472.14
 He's sweating.

406
2473.14 --> 2475.14
 What's wrong?

407
2476.14 --> 2478.14
 I'm fine.

408
2478.14 --> 2480.14
 I'll talk to him.

409
2480.14 --> 2482.14
 I'm fine.

410
2482.14 --> 2484.14
 I'm fine.

411
2485.14 --> 2487.14
 You're fine.

412
2487.14 --> 2489.14
 I'm fine.

413
2489.14 --> 2491.14
 I feel good.

414
2491.14 --> 2493.14
 I feel good.

415
2493.14 --> 2495.14
 No!

416
2496.14 --> 2498.14
 He's not done yet.

417
2498.14 --> 2500.14
 No!

418
2500.14 --> 2503.90
 Please stop.

419
2503.90 --> 2505.90
 Do you want me to kiss you?

420
2518.94 --> 2520.94
 Let me hold your hands.

421
2521.94 --> 2525.38
 Let me hold your hands.

422
2553.00 --> 2555.00
 I'm sorry.

423
2593.66 --> 2603.05
 You feel good, don't you?

424
2606.05 --> 2608.05
 You feel good, don't you?

425
2608.05 --> 2615.05
 It's the best to be with your senpai.

426
2615.05 --> 2618.05
 Stand up, senpai.

427
2645.25 --> 2698.01
 Don't you think it's rude?

428
2698.01 --> 2705.01
 Don't you think it's bad to be with your senpai?

429
2705.01 --> 2710.58
 Don't you think it's rude?

430
2713.58 --> 2719.21
 Listen to your senpai.

431
2719.21 --> 2728.20
 Don't look at me.

432
2731.20 --> 2746.33
 I'm fine.

433
2765.67 --> 2768.67
 I'll show you my face.

434
2770.67 --> 2773.67
 I'll show you my face.

435
2773.67 --> 2776.67
 I'm fine.

436
2776.67 --> 2779.67
 I'm fine.

437
2779.67 --> 2782.67
 I'm fine.

438
2782.67 --> 2827.11
 I feel good.

439
2829.49 --> 2838.60
 I'm fine.

440
2838.60 --> 2841.60
 I'm fine.

441
2852.57 --> 2914.48
 Do you feel good?

442
2914.48 --> 2917.48
 Look at me.

443
2921.84 --> 2924.84
 Look at my face.

444
2924.84 --> 2927.84
 I want you to show me your face.

445
2954.83 --> 2961.06
 I want you to show me your face.

446
2971.29 --> 2999.43
 I think you know.

447
2999.43 --> 3002.43
 Don't tell anyone.

448
3002.43 --> 3023.86
 I'm going to take a bath.

449
3023.86 --> 3026.86
 I was disappointed.

450
3026.86 --> 3030.86
 I've never been in a fight with my boyfriend.

451
3030.86 --> 3036.86
 I was in a fight with my boyfriend.

452
3036.86 --> 3043.43
 I had a scar that would never disappear.

453
3043.43 --> 3056.32
 I'm sorry.

454
3056.32 --> 3086.46
 I'm sorry.

455
3086.46 --> 3089.46
 I'm sorry.

456
3089.46 --> 3092.46
 I'm tired.

457
3092.46 --> 3095.46
 I'm tired.

458
3096.46 --> 3101.86
 Don't do this to me.

459
3101.86 --> 3104.86
 I'm here alone.

460
3104.86 --> 3107.86
 I'm here alone.

461
3107.86 --> 3110.86
 Don't call him.

462
3110.86 --> 3112.86
 Don't call me.

463
3112.86 --> 3114.86
 I know.

464
3114.86 --> 3116.86
 You'll be in trouble.

465
3116.86 --> 3118.86
 Right?

466
3118.86 --> 3119.86
 Or what?

467
3119.86 --> 3121.86
 Are you going to tell the teacher?

468
3121.86 --> 3123.86
 Are you going to call the police?

469
3123.86 --> 3124.86
 Right?

470
3124.86 --> 3128.86
 Because of you, everyone can't participate in the competition.

471
3128.86 --> 3134.34
 Please stop.

472
3134.34 --> 3135.34
 Right?

473
3135.34 --> 3136.34
 So,

474
3136.34 --> 3141.83
 I'm fine alone.

475
3141.83 --> 3143.83
 Give me a massage.

476
3143.83 --> 3145.83
 Give me a massage.

477
3147.83 --> 3155.09
 I told you to give me a massage.

478
3156.09 --> 3157.09
 I know.

479
3157.09 --> 3162.00
 You'll be in trouble.

480
3162.00 --> 3166.94
 Right?

481
3166.94 --> 3172.82
 I'm fine alone.

482
3174.82 --> 3176.82
 Raise your head.

483
3176.82 --> 3178.82
 Look at me.

484
3180.82 --> 3184.90
 Are you kidding me?

485
3184.90 --> 3185.90
 Hey.

486
3186.90 --> 3187.90
 Look at me.

487
3196.22 --> 3199.22
 I told you to raise your head.

488
3199.22 --> 3200.22
 Hey.

489
3201.22 --> 3202.22
 Hey.

490
3202.22 --> 3241.34
 What are you doing?

491
3241.34 --> 3257.75
 What are you doing?

492
3263.75 --> 3265.75
 Listen to me.

493
3267.75 --> 3269.75
 Listen to me.

494
3271.75 --> 3272.75
 You'll get hurt.

495
3291.11 --> 3298.48
 You'll get hurt.

496
3299.48 --> 3322.98
 What's this?

497
3323.98 --> 3324.98
 It's wet.

498
3340.77 --> 3371.24
 Please.

499
3371.24 --> 3372.24
 It's hot, isn't it?

500
3390.87 --> 3392.87
 It's hard, isn't it?

501
3394.87 --> 3396.87
 Camping is tough.

502
3396.87 --> 3397.87
 It's hard, isn't it?

503
3397.87 --> 3399.87
 Give me a massage.

504
3399.87 --> 3400.87
 Look at me.

505
3400.87 --> 3402.87
 I told you to raise your head.

506
3412.70 --> 3414.70
 You don't want to get hurt, do you?

507
3414.70 --> 3417.70
 I don't want you to get hurt.

508
3417.70 --> 3420.70
 Give me a massage.

509
3420.70 --> 3424.46
 I told you to give me a massage.

510
3424.46 --> 3426.46
 Get out of my way.

511
3426.46 --> 3427.46
 Hey.

512
3427.46 --> 3430.46
 I'll always be nice to you.

513
3431.46 --> 3433.46
 Don't get in my way.

514
3433.46 --> 3437.89
 You're beautiful.

515
3437.89 --> 3439.89
 Your hands are stopped.

516
3439.89 --> 3441.89
 Your hands are stopped.

517
3449.89 --> 3450.89
 It's hot, isn't it?

518
3450.89 --> 3451.89
 It's hot, isn't it?

519
3458.89 --> 3459.89
 You're beautiful.

520
3463.89 --> 3464.89
 Don't resist.

521
3468.89 --> 3472.10
 You're beautiful.

522
3473.10 --> 3474.10
 Don't resist.

523
3481.66 --> 3523.84
 It's hot, isn't it?

524
3579.31 --> 3613.30
 I don't want you to get hurt.

525
3673.92 --> 3692.42
 Don't resist.

526
3693.42 --> 3694.42
 It's hot, isn't it?

527
3733.79 --> 3734.79
 You're beautiful.

528
3735.79 --> 3736.79
 It's hot, isn't it?

529
3736.79 --> 3737.79
 It's hot, isn't it?

530
3919.71 --> 3921.71
 Good boy.

531
3928.98 --> 3930.98
 Good boy.

532
3930.98 --> 3932.98
 You are a good boy.

533
3937.98 --> 3939.98
 Good boy.

534
3939.98 --> 3941.98
 Good boy.

535
3941.98 --> 3942.98
 Don't cry.

536
3948.98 --> 3950.98
 Support her with all your strength.

537
3954.98 --> 3956.98
 It's not over until you let her out.

538
3959.98 --> 3961.98
 You've been in a spa for a long time, so you're still the same.

539
3963.98 --> 3964.98
 Speak up.

540
3965.98 --> 4026.28
 Come on.

541
4026.28 --> 4027.28
 Don't cry.

542
4052.45 --> 4054.45
 Don't cry.

543
4055.45 --> 4056.45
 Come on.

544
4069.50 --> 4094.38
 Who did this to them?

545
4102.01 --> 4105.01
 Didn't they see it?

546
4111.99 --> 4112.99
 This is going to be a big deal.

547
4114.99 --> 4116.99
 They won't be able to participate in the tournament.

548
4123.91 --> 4124.91
 You're an adult, too.

549
4126.91 --> 4127.91
 Make your own decisions.

550
4129.91 --> 4131.91
 Just think about it.

551
4134.91 --> 4135.91
 I can't do it anymore.

552
4139.91 --> 4140.91
 All right.

553
4141.91 --> 4142.91
 You can sleep in my room tonight.

554
4144.91 --> 4145.91
 There's a futon there.

555
4147.91 --> 4148.91
 Yes.

556
4150.91 --> 4151.91
 Thank you.

557
4152.91 --> 4155.91
 If it weren't for me, this wouldn't have happened.

558
4157.91 --> 4160.91
 And I ended up sleeping in the director's room.

559
4162.91 --> 4164.91
 I've had another tragedy.

560
4367.02 --> 4370.48
 Look at her.

561
4371.48 --> 4377.35
 She's a terrible woman.

562
4381.33 --> 4382.33
 Hold her down.

563
4384.33 --> 4385.33
 Come on.

564
4387.33 --> 4397.13
 Don't cry.

565
4405.13 --> 4406.13
 Don't cry.

566
4407.13 --> 4408.13
 Don't cry.

567
4418.62 --> 4419.62
 Don't cry.

568
4422.62 --> 4423.62
 It's okay.

569
4435.58 --> 4436.58
 Don't cry.

570
4448.78 --> 4449.78
 You're tired, aren't you?

571
4452.78 --> 4453.78
 Don't cry.

572
4454.78 --> 4455.78
 Don't cry.

573
4462.09 --> 4463.09
 Come here.

574
4466.09 --> 4467.09
 Don't cry.

575
4473.09 --> 4474.09
 Don't cry.

576
4478.09 --> 4479.09
 She's a terrible woman.

577
4482.09 --> 4483.09
 I'm going to hold her down.

578
4484.09 --> 4485.09
 You're going to die.

579
4487.09 --> 4488.09
 You're going to die.

580
4499.98 --> 4500.98
 You feel good, don't you?

581
4501.98 --> 4502.98
 You feel good, don't you?

582
4522.54 --> 4523.54
 You feel good, don't you?

583
4523.54 --> 4524.54
 It's delicious.

584
4527.54 --> 4528.54
 You feel good, don't you?

585
4530.54 --> 4531.54
 You feel good, don't you?

586
4534.54 --> 4535.54
 I'm going to hold her down.

587
4556.56 --> 4557.56
 You feel good, don't you?

588
4559.56 --> 4561.56
 You're sleeping next to the director.

589
4561.56 --> 4562.56
 You're sleeping next to the director.

590
4565.56 --> 4566.56
 You feel good, don't you?

591
4568.56 --> 4569.56
 You can hear the director.

592
4574.56 --> 4575.56
 You're a terrible woman.

593
4580.56 --> 4581.56
 You have to hold her down.

594
4587.82 --> 4588.82
 You're holding her down.

595
4591.82 --> 4592.82
 You have to hold her down.

596
4597.58 --> 4598.58
 You're nervous, aren't you?

597
4602.58 --> 4603.58
 You feel good, don't you?

598
4628.26 --> 4629.26
 You feel good, don't you?

599
4632.26 --> 4633.26
 You're wet.

600
4634.26 --> 4637.14
 You're wet.

601
4642.14 --> 4643.14
 You feel good, don't you?

602
4646.14 --> 4657.65
 I want you to make it.

603
4675.70 --> 4676.70
 You feel good, don't you?

604
4677.70 --> 4678.70
 You feel good, don't you?

605
4701.96 --> 4711.89
 You're getting hot, aren't you?

606
4714.89 --> 4725.81
 Shush!

607
4725.81 --> 4730.81
 You're okay, aren't you?

608
4730.81 --> 4735.81
 You're not sick, are you?

609
4735.81 --> 4748.07
 You're not sick, are you?

610
4748.07 --> 4753.07
 You're wearing a nice panty

611
4753.07 --> 4772.98
 You're wearing a nice panty

612
4772.98 --> 4777.98
 You're being praised

613
4777.98 --> 4782.98
 You're wearing a nice panty

614
4782.98 --> 4791.98
 You're wearing a nice panty

615
4791.98 --> 4796.98
 It's okay

616
4796.98 --> 4798.98
 I can't do it anymore.

617
4814.16 --> 4819.52
 Here we go.

618
4820.52 --> 4827.99
 You look like you're feeling better.

619
4851.50 --> 4854.50
 I'm going to lick you from the tip of your toes.

620
4855.50 --> 4857.50
 I'll lick you all over.

621
4857.50 --> 4859.50
 All over.

622
4859.50 --> 4861.50
 It feels good, doesn't it?

623
4861.50 --> 4863.50
 It smells good.

624
4864.50 --> 4866.50
 I'm going to lick you from the tip of your toes.

625
4878.13 --> 4882.81
 Can you see it?

626
4882.81 --> 4884.81
 You look like you're feeling better.

627
4890.50 --> 4909.24
 It feels good, doesn't it?

628
4911.24 --> 4913.24
 You look like you're feeling good.

629
4913.24 --> 4915.24
 I'll lick you all over.

630
4919.24 --> 4921.24
 I can't do it anymore.

631
4921.24 --> 4923.24
 Really?

632
4923.24 --> 4925.24
 I'm going to take off your panties and check.

633
4926.24 --> 4928.24
 I'm going to let you sleep.

634
4928.24 --> 4930.24
 It's okay.

635
4942.93 --> 4944.93
 Hold me tight.

636
4944.93 --> 4957.02
 Hold it

637
4957.02 --> 4976.72
 Hold it

638
4976.72 --> 4982.72
 It has become round

639
4982.72 --> 4984.72
 Super beautiful

640
4984.72 --> 4987.72
 Super beautiful

641
5021.79 --> 5036.15
 I was surprised

642
5036.15 --> 5039.15
 You said something

643
5039.15 --> 5043.15
 You said something

644
5043.15 --> 5045.15
 I was seen by everyone

645
5045.15 --> 5051.15
 I was seen by everyone

646
5051.15 --> 5054.15
 What is this

647
5054.15 --> 5059.15
 What is this

648
5059.15 --> 5061.15
 I don't want to

649
5061.15 --> 5082.48
 I don't want to

650
5082.48 --> 5087.48
 I don't want to

651
5087.48 --> 5096.48
 I don't want to

652
5096.48 --> 5110.37
 I don't want to

653
5110.37 --> 5125.58
 Super beautiful

654
5125.58 --> 5130.58
 Super beautiful

655
5130.58 --> 5138.58
 Super beautiful

656
5138.58 --> 5148.58
 I don't want to

657
5148.58 --> 5161.30
 I don't want to

658
5161.30 --> 5169.08
 I don't want to

659
5169.08 --> 5171.08
 You can pull it out, can't you?

660
5172.08 --> 5176.48
 I don't want to.

661
5176.48 --> 5191.06
 You don't want to?

662
5191.06 --> 5194.69
 I don't want to.

663
5205.36 --> 5215.07
 Oh, it's closed again.

664
5216.07 --> 5217.07
 Are you looking forward to it?

665
5217.07 --> 5219.07
 What if I touch it?

666
5227.89 --> 5229.89
 It's clean. It's clean.

667
5229.89 --> 5231.89
 It's clean, isn't it?

668
5231.89 --> 5233.89
 I don't want to.

669
5234.89 --> 5236.89
 We're all friends.

670
5236.89 --> 5238.89
 We're all friends.

671
5238.89 --> 5240.89
 Are you happy?

672
5240.89 --> 5242.89
 Are you happy?

673
5242.89 --> 5244.89
 Are you happy?

674
5244.89 --> 5248.58
 I don't want to.

675
5251.58 --> 5253.58
 You want it again, don't you?

676
5255.58 --> 5257.58
 I don't want to.

677
5257.58 --> 5259.58
 Please be quiet.

678
5259.58 --> 5261.58
 I'll give it to you if you beg me.

679
5261.58 --> 5263.58
 Please be quiet.

680
5263.58 --> 5265.58
 I don't want to.

681
5265.58 --> 5267.58
 I don't want to.

682
5267.58 --> 5290.93
 You don't have enough medicine, do you?

683
5291.93 --> 5293.93
 I'll give you a substitute.

684
5293.93 --> 5294.93
 It's okay. It's okay.

685
5294.93 --> 5296.93
 I'm not afraid.

686
5296.93 --> 5298.93
 I'm not afraid.

687
5301.93 --> 5323.42
 Hold it. Hold it.

688
5324.42 --> 5326.42
 I don't want to.

689
5328.42 --> 5342.51
 I'm scared.

690
5345.51 --> 5349.72
 I'm scared.

691
5349.72 --> 5351.72
 I don't want to.

692
5355.72 --> 5357.72
 I'll give it to you.

693
5358.72 --> 5360.72
 That's right.

694
5360.72 --> 5362.72
 I'll give it to you.

695
5368.72 --> 5370.72
 I'll make you feel better.

696
5370.72 --> 5372.72
 I don't want to.

697
5376.72 --> 5378.72
 Be honest.

698
5379.72 --> 5381.72
 I don't want to.

699
5381.72 --> 5383.72
 Help me.

700
5385.72 --> 5387.72
 Help me.

701
5400.84 --> 5402.84
 I don't want to.

702
5406.84 --> 5408.84
 Do you feel good?

703
5408.84 --> 5410.84
 I don't want to.

704
5410.84 --> 5412.84
 Help me.

705
5412.84 --> 5414.84
 I don't want to.

706
5417.84 --> 5419.84
 Go.

707
5419.84 --> 5421.84
 Go.

708
5428.92 --> 5430.92
 Go.

709
5441.92 --> 5443.92
 I'll give it to you.

710
5443.92 --> 5445.92
 Come on.

711
5450.92 --> 5458.58
 Come on.

712
5459.58 --> 5461.58
 Look at me.

713
5462.58 --> 5464.58
 Look at me.

714
5465.58 --> 5467.58
 Good boy.

715
5470.58 --> 5472.58
 Are you obedient?

716
5474.58 --> 5476.58
 I'll give you a massage.

717
5479.58 --> 5481.58
 Be obedient.

718
5484.58 --> 5486.58
 Open your mouth.

719
5489.58 --> 5491.58
 Open your mouth.

720
5491.58 --> 5493.58
 Let me go.

721
5542.56 --> 5544.56
 Are you obedient?

722
5548.56 --> 5550.56
 Kono-chan.

723
5551.56 --> 5553.56
 Help me.

724
5553.56 --> 5555.56
 Kono-chan.

725
5555.56 --> 5566.55
 I'll give you a massage.

726
5567.55 --> 5574.51
 I'll give you a massage.

727
5582.02 --> 5584.02
 You like this, don't you?

728
5584.02 --> 5586.02
 Let me go.

729
5588.02 --> 5590.02
 Let me go.

730
5590.02 --> 5592.02
 Let me go.

731
5592.02 --> 5594.02
 Let me go.

732
5598.02 --> 5600.02
 Yes, yes.

733
5625.42 --> 5632.44
 You love this, don't you?

734
5649.86 --> 5651.86
 Be quiet.

735
5657.42 --> 5664.38
 I'm your manager for a year.

736
5664.38 --> 5666.38
 You're a robot.

737
5680.14 --> 5682.14
 Yuma, come here.

738
5684.14 --> 5686.14
 Talk to your manager.

739
5687.14 --> 5690.14
 No, I don't want to.

740
5715.50 --> 5718.50
 Why are you running away?

741
5738.79 --> 5757.46
 I'm going to take your clothes off.

742
5757.46 --> 5759.46
 Stand up.

743
5770.46 --> 5781.20
 Show me your face.

744
5781.20 --> 5783.20
 You have a cute face.

745
5785.20 --> 5787.20
 No.

746
5788.20 --> 5790.20
 No.

747
5803.20 --> 5807.98
 No.

748
5811.98 --> 5813.98
 No.

749
5824.58 --> 5827.58
 I can't see.

750
5848.00 --> 5850.00
 I can't see.

751
5850.00 --> 5852.00
 Help me.

752
5876.72 --> 5878.72
 I can't see.

753
5918.12 --> 5920.12
 I can't see.

754
5920.12 --> 5922.12
 It's fine.

755
5923.12 --> 5925.12
 I can't see.

756
5947.99 --> 5949.99
 No.

757
5956.99 --> 5958.99
 I can't see.

758
5960.99 --> 5962.99
 What's wrong?

759
5964.99 --> 5966.99
 I can't see.

760
5966.99 --> 5968.99
 I can't see.

761
5968.99 --> 5970.99
 No.

762
5978.99 --> 5980.99
 I can't see.

763
5980.99 --> 5988.07
 You have a cute face.

764
5990.07 --> 5994.47
 I can't see.

765
6006.46 --> 6008.46
 I can't see.

766
6021.46 --> 6025.73
 I can't see.

767
6026.73 --> 6036.89
 What's wrong?

768
6038.89 --> 6040.89
 That's amazing.

769
6040.89 --> 6042.89
 Were you that nervous?

770
6045.89 --> 6047.89
 What's wrong?

771
6064.89 --> 6066.89
 You have a runny nose.

772
6066.89 --> 6068.89
 Look to your right.

773
6068.89 --> 6070.89
 No.

774
6078.84 --> 6080.84
 You have a runny nose.

775
6080.84 --> 6082.84
 You have a runny nose.

776
6082.84 --> 6084.84
 You have a runny nose.

777
6086.84 --> 6090.54
 I'm going to make you feel uncomfortable.

778
6090.54 --> 6092.54
 You're a member of my club.

779
6092.54 --> 6094.54
 You're a member of my club.

780
6095.54 --> 6099.36
 That's right.

781
6104.36 --> 6106.36
 I'm sorry.

782
6119.72 --> 6121.72
 It's comfortable.

783
6121.72 --> 6123.72
 What's wrong?

784
6123.72 --> 6125.72
 Do you want to go to another room?

785
6125.72 --> 6127.72
 You're greedy.

786
6131.99 --> 6133.99
 Is it okay to stay like this?

787
6133.99 --> 6135.99
 Which side is better?

788
6135.99 --> 6137.99
 Whichever side is fine.

789
6137.99 --> 6139.99
 Which side is better?

790
6139.99 --> 6153.67
 I'm tired.

791
6153.67 --> 6155.67
 Get up.

792
6174.49 --> 6178.44
 Your voice is loud.

793
6178.44 --> 6180.44
 Get up.

794
6188.78 --> 6190.78
 Do you want to kiss me again?

795
6194.78 --> 6196.78
 Get up.

796
6215.50 --> 6217.50
 Show me your face.

797
6217.50 --> 6219.50
 You like me, don't you?

798
6219.50 --> 6221.50
 I'm sorry.

799
6304.28 --> 6306.28
 I don't want to.

800
6306.28 --> 6308.28
 Do you like me?

801
6308.28 --> 6310.28
 I don't want to.

802
6312.28 --> 6314.28
 I don't want to.

803
6318.28 --> 6320.28
 It's comfortable.

804
6320.28 --> 6322.28
 I don't want to.

805
6322.28 --> 6327.19
 I don't want to.

806
6340.17 --> 6342.17
 Don't say that.

807
6342.17 --> 6344.17
 I want you to feel good.

808
6344.17 --> 6346.17
 I don't want to.

809
6346.17 --> 6348.17
 I don't want to.

810
6348.17 --> 6350.17
 It's okay.

811
6352.17 --> 6354.17
 I've already kissed you once.

812
6354.17 --> 6356.17
 It doesn't matter.

813
6358.17 --> 6363.34
 I love you.

814
6367.34 --> 6369.34
 I don't want to.

815
6369.34 --> 6371.34
 You look good.

816
6371.34 --> 6373.34
 Do you feel good?

817
6373.34 --> 6375.34
 I don't want to.

818
6377.34 --> 6384.36
 I don't want to.

819
6386.36 --> 6388.36
 I don't want to.

820
6398.66 --> 6403.90
 I don't want to.

821
6403.90 --> 6411.43
 I don't want to.

822
6458.31 --> 6460.31
 What's wrong?

823
6466.31 --> 6468.31
 Do you feel good?

824
6468.31 --> 6473.35
 I don't want to.

825
6483.35 --> 6485.35
 I'm going.

826
6485.35 --> 6487.35
 Let's go together.

827
6489.35 --> 6491.35
 I don't want to.

828
6491.35 --> 6493.35
 I don't want to.

829
6497.35 --> 6499.35
 I'm going.

830
6499.35 --> 6501.35
 I don't want to.

831
6513.58 --> 6515.58
 You're sleeping again.

832
6515.58 --> 6523.94
 I'll put you in bed.

833
6568.49 --> 6577.62
 I don't want to.

834
6579.62 --> 6581.62
 I don't want to.

835
6583.62 --> 6587.51
 I don't want to.

836
6587.51 --> 6589.51
 I don't want to.

837
6601.69 --> 6608.07
 I'm going.

838
6633.18 --> 6635.18
 I love you.

839
6637.18 --> 6639.18
 Let's take a bath.

840
6639.18 --> 6641.18
 I'm going.

841
6641.18 --> 6643.18
 I'm going.

842
6643.18 --> 6645.18
 I'm going.

843
6659.58 --> 6661.58
 I wanted to get away from here.

844
6661.58 --> 6663.58
 I wanted to run away.

845
6663.58 --> 6665.58
 I wanted to see you.

846
6667.58 --> 6702.12
 I wanted you to hold me.

847
6706.12 --> 6756.51
 It's a traditional ritual, isn't it?

848
6756.51 --> 6762.75
 I'm sure I'm winning every year.

849
6762.75 --> 6772.79
 Have you been doing that?

850
6772.79 --> 6779.67
 You have to put up with it for a while.

851
6779.67 --> 6787.21
 You're running away.

852
6787.21 --> 6791.65
 We're winning, aren't we?

853
6791.65 --> 6803.55
 It's the manager's job to contribute to the team's victory, isn't it?

854
6803.55 --> 6807.44
 Are you still saying that?

855
6807.44 --> 6809.88
 You're making a mess of it.

856
6809.88 --> 6820.65
 It's your fault.

857
6820.65 --> 6823.65
 I'm not a human being.

858
6823.65 --> 6826.73
 What are you talking about?

859
6826.73 --> 6830.37
 I'm your manager.

860
6830.37 --> 6862.08
 What should I do with you?

861
6862.08 --> 6865.36
 You're late.

862
6865.36 --> 6878.46
 Where are you going?

863
6878.46 --> 6880.94
 I'll take care of you.

864
6880.94 --> 6886.92
 You're late.

865
7427.27 --> 7431.54
 You're not allowed to go anywhere.

866
7431.54 --> 7444.17
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

867
7444.17 --> 7451.45
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

868
8385.43 --> 8398.66
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

869
8434.02 --> 8436.02
 Let's go together.

870
8453.84 --> 8455.84
 You've got a lot.

871
8456.84 --> 8458.84
 It was nice.

872
8458.84 --> 8462.41
 I'll put you in.

873
8477.41 --> 8478.41
 It's small.

874
8544.11 --> 8564.03
 You can do it.

875
8567.03 --> 8571.69
 You can do it.

876
8576.70 --> 8578.70
 What's wrong?

877
8598.29 --> 8600.29
 Move a little.

878
8630.97 --> 8632.97
 You like it, don't you?

879
8636.82 --> 8638.82
 I want you to feel better.

880
8639.82 --> 8641.82
 Let's go while being embraced.

881
8644.82 --> 8682.05
 You can do it.

882
8685.64 --> 8691.77
 You like it, don't you?

883
8789.62 --> 8791.62
 It looks like it's over.

884
8792.62 --> 8795.62
 I'll do my best to practice for the tournament.

885
8797.62 --> 8799.62
 Let's go.

886
8801.62 --> 8803.62
 Clean it up.

887
8826.54 --> 8828.54
 I quit university because of this.

888
8829.54 --> 8833.54
 I broke up with my boyfriend and fell in love with a woman.

889
8835.54 --> 8841.54
 Unfortunately, I saw the news that the university I went to won this year.
