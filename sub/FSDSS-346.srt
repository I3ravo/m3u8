1
5.36 --> 6.36
 Yes.

2
7.28 --> 8.28
 Oh, Ryo.

3
8.28 --> 8.78
 Ryo.

4
9.96 --> 11.46
 It's been a while, right, Toru-kun?

5
11.80 --> 13.04
 It's been a while, Moe-chan.

6
13.74 --> 15.18
 Come on, get in.

7
15.76 --> 16.76
 Excuse me.

8
16.76 --> 17.76
 Excuse me.

9
20.20 --> 21.20
 It's been a while.

10
27.70 --> 30.70
 Sorry, I'm late than I planned.

11
30.70 --> 31.98
 It's totally fine.

12
31.98 --> 34.06
 It's because Yosuke is staying up late.

13
35.06 --> 39.38
 But, you know, my boss won't let me go back to the bar.

14
39.38 --> 40.38
 Hmm.

15
41.38 --> 44.38
 When are you two going to start living together?

16
45.38 --> 48.38
 If I can, maybe next month?

17
48.38 --> 49.38
 Yes.

18
49.38 --> 58.38
 Even if it's late, I want to move to the next month.

19
58.38 --> 59.38
 That's right.

20
60.38 --> 63.38
 Also, I'm looking for a bed.

21
63.38 --> 64.38
 Yes.

22
65.38 --> 66.38
 Hey, Moe.

23
66.38 --> 67.38
 Yes?

24
67.38 --> 70.38
 Isn't it too early to buy a bed?

25
70.38 --> 74.38
 It's my dream to live with a cat.

26
74.38 --> 76.38
 I can't give up that.

27
77.38 --> 78.38
 Yes, yes.

28
81.38 --> 83.38
 I have two items that I'm interested in.

29
83.38 --> 84.38
 Where are they?

30
84.38 --> 85.38
 Here.

31
86.38 --> 88.38
 Oh, wow.

32
88.38 --> 89.38
 Wow.

33
91.38 --> 92.38
 Under the station?

34
92.38 --> 94.38
 Yes, yes, yes.

35
94.38 --> 98.46
 The rent is also cheap.

36
98.46 --> 99.46
 That's right.

37
99.46 --> 100.46
 Yes.

38
100.46 --> 102.46
 It's about 50,000 yen per person.

39
102.46 --> 104.46
 Yes, that's right.

40
105.46 --> 106.46
 There are other things.

41
106.46 --> 107.46
 Like this.

42
108.46 --> 109.46
 Wow.

43
109.46 --> 110.46
 Wow.

44
111.46 --> 112.46
 Wow.

45
112.46 --> 113.46
 That's nice.

46
113.46 --> 115.46
 I like this one better.

47
115.46 --> 118.46
 You can buy a bed with this rent?

48
118.46 --> 119.46
 Yes.

49
119.46 --> 123.46
 It's my company's property, so it's not on the Internet yet.

50
123.46 --> 124.46
 Is that so?

51
124.46 --> 125.46
 Yes.

52
125.46 --> 126.46
 That's great.

53
126.46 --> 127.46
 Yes.

54
127.46 --> 135.72
 But it's a little far from the station.

55
135.72 --> 139.72
 Yes, but it's new.

56
140.72 --> 142.72
 You can also buy a pet.

57
142.72 --> 145.22
 Yes.

58
145.22 --> 146.22
 It's close to the convenience store.

59
146.22 --> 147.22
 That's right.

60
147.22 --> 150.22
 The quality of the previous room is not good.

61
150.22 --> 151.22
 Is that so?

62
151.22 --> 152.22
 Yes.

63
164.07 --> 165.07
 Hey, Moe.

64
165.07 --> 166.07
 Yes?

65
166.07 --> 168.07
 The stocking is wired.

66
168.07 --> 169.07
 What?

67
169.07 --> 170.07
 Oh, that's right.

68
170.07 --> 171.07
 I don't like it.

69
171.07 --> 172.07
 Since when?

70
172.07 --> 173.07
 I'm embarrassed.

71
173.07 --> 174.07
 You've said a lot.

72
174.07 --> 176.07
 Can I borrow the bathroom?

73
176.07 --> 177.07
 Yes.

74
177.07 --> 178.07
 It's on the left.

75
178.07 --> 179.07
 Thank you.

76
179.07 --> 185.61
 I'm sorry.

77
185.61 --> 186.61
 Yosuke.

78
186.61 --> 189.61
 How long have you been dating Moe?

79
191.61 --> 196.61
 It's been four years since I was in the second year of college.

80
197.61 --> 198.61
 I see.

81
198.61 --> 203.61
 Do you plan to get married?

82
204.61 --> 207.61
 I haven't thought about it yet.

83
208.61 --> 209.61
 I see.

84
209.61 --> 210.61
 Yes.

85
210.61 --> 213.43
 Oh, Moe.

86
213.43 --> 216.43
 I have a trash can.

87
216.43 --> 217.43
 Please put it here.

88
217.43 --> 218.43
 I'm sorry.

89
218.43 --> 219.43
 Thank you.

90
219.43 --> 220.43
 Yes.

91
220.43 --> 222.43
 How's the stocking?

92
222.43 --> 223.43
 Yes.

93
223.43 --> 224.43
 I think it's pretty good.

94
224.43 --> 225.43
 Yes.

95
225.43 --> 226.43
 I see.

96
226.43 --> 229.43
 Then, do you want to see it early next week?

97
229.43 --> 231.43
 Until then, I won't open it.

98
231.43 --> 232.43
 What?

99
232.43 --> 233.43
 What?

100
233.43 --> 234.43
 It's good.

101
234.43 --> 235.43
 Yes.

102
235.43 --> 236.43
 Thank you.

103
236.43 --> 238.43
 Thank you.

104
241.43 --> 244.43
 Please check this.

105
244.43 --> 245.43
 Okay.

106
247.43 --> 248.43
 Can I put it here?

107
248.43 --> 249.43
 Yes.

108
249.43 --> 255.69
 Oh, by the way.

109
255.69 --> 257.69
 Do you want to have a meal together?

110
257.69 --> 258.69
 Yes.

111
258.69 --> 259.69
 Sounds good.

112
259.69 --> 260.69
 Yes.

113
260.69 --> 261.69
 Let's go.

114
261.69 --> 262.69
 Yes.

115
262.69 --> 273.64
 Let's go.

116
357.94 --> 366.98
 This medicine is used in the carcass of horses.

117
366.98 --> 375.98
 If you apply this to the human body, it will have a great effect on sexual excitement in a short amount of time.

118
375.98 --> 382.98
 You will feel a sense of pleasure.

119
382.98 --> 387.06
 Does this really work?

120
390.46 --> 399.10
 Anyway, I wonder what will happen if I apply this to my body.

121
402.05 --> 406.05
 Well, both products were very good.

122
406.05 --> 408.05
 Yes.

123
408.05 --> 411.05
 But I think the second one is better.

124
411.05 --> 412.05
 The second one?

125
412.05 --> 413.05
 Yes.

126
414.05 --> 418.05
 But I think the first one is closer to the station.

127
418.05 --> 419.05
 Yes.

128
419.05 --> 421.05
 I thought it was good.

129
421.05 --> 423.05
 It's because you can apply it to the last minute.

130
423.05 --> 425.05
 Did you find out?

131
425.05 --> 426.05
 Yes.

132
426.05 --> 432.05
 If you apply it to the last minute, both products will have a great effect on sexual excitement in a short amount of time.

133
432.05 --> 433.05
 Yes.

134
433.05 --> 434.05
 That's right.

135
435.05 --> 437.05
 I'm sorry.

136
438.05 --> 439.05
 It doesn't matter at all.

137
440.05 --> 441.05
 By the way, Moe-chan.

138
441.05 --> 442.05
 Yes.

139
442.05 --> 444.05
 I got a delicious black tea from the company.

140
444.05 --> 445.05
 Do you want to drink it?

141
445.05 --> 446.05
 Can I?

142
446.05 --> 447.05
 Yes.

143
447.05 --> 448.05
 I want to drink it.

144
448.05 --> 449.05
 I'll prepare it for you.

145
449.05 --> 450.05
 Thank you.

146
452.05 --> 453.05
 What should I do?

147
456.64 --> 457.64
 It's spacious here.

148
457.64 --> 460.02
 Yes.

149
461.02 --> 463.71
 It's small.

150
463.71 --> 464.71
 A little.

151
465.71 --> 467.71
 It's difficult to move.

152
467.71 --> 468.71
 Yes.

153
468.71 --> 470.71
 It's a two-person house.

154
470.71 --> 471.71
 That's right.

155
471.71 --> 474.71
 We live in the same house.

156
474.71 --> 477.47
 Moe-chan.

157
477.47 --> 478.47
 Yes.

158
478.47 --> 480.47
 What are your plans for next month?

159
480.47 --> 481.47
 I see.

160
482.47 --> 484.47
 You have to take a day off from moving.

161
484.47 --> 485.47
 That's right.

162
485.47 --> 486.47
 I have to get ready.

163
486.47 --> 487.47
 Yes.

164
487.47 --> 488.47
 Well...

165
488.47 --> 489.47
 I see.

166
497.35 --> 501.35
 I think I'll take a day off from the company this week.

167
501.35 --> 502.35
 Do you think so?

168
502.35 --> 503.35
 Yes.

169
503.35 --> 507.35
 Then, I'll take a day off this year.

170
507.35 --> 509.35
 Let's take a day off this week.

171
509.35 --> 510.35
 Yes.

172
510.35 --> 511.35
 Let's do it.

173
511.35 --> 513.35
 The rest is up to you.

174
513.35 --> 514.35
 Yes.

175
514.35 --> 515.35
 What should I do?

176
516.35 --> 517.35
 Here you are.

177
517.35 --> 518.35
 Thank you.

178
519.35 --> 522.43
 It smells good.

179
522.43 --> 523.43
 I'll enjoy it.

180
523.43 --> 524.43
 I'll enjoy it.

181
527.74 --> 529.74
 It smells good and it's delicious.

182
539.91 --> 542.91
 Does Toru have a girlfriend?

183
543.91 --> 544.91
 A girlfriend?

184
544.91 --> 547.91
 He's the only one in the company.

185
547.91 --> 551.86
 I don't think he has a girlfriend.

186
551.86 --> 555.86
 He didn't have a girlfriend when he was in college.

187
556.86 --> 557.86
 That's right.

188
557.86 --> 562.86
 What about the girl who was in the same circle as you when you were three years old?

189
563.86 --> 564.86
 No.

190
564.86 --> 565.86
 She was different.

191
565.86 --> 567.86
 She was very cute.

192
567.86 --> 569.86
 She was nothing special.

193
569.86 --> 571.86
 Was she that good?

194
571.86 --> 572.86
 Well...

195
574.86 --> 576.86
 I don't want to talk about me.

196
576.86 --> 577.86
 Anyway, let's drink.

197
577.86 --> 578.86
 What?

198
578.86 --> 580.86
 Moe, why don't you introduce her to me?

199
581.86 --> 583.86
 I don't know who she is.

200
583.86 --> 584.86
 I don't know.

201
584.86 --> 587.86
 But all my friends have boyfriends.

202
588.86 --> 589.86
 You don't have to be so careful.

203
589.86 --> 590.86
 Let's drink.

204
590.86 --> 591.86
 Okay.

205
593.86 --> 597.86
 Toru, there was a little man standing there.

206
598.86 --> 599.86
 A little man.

207
600.86 --> 602.86
 When I opened the door behind him,

208
602.86 --> 606.86
 there was a bald man next to him.

209
608.86 --> 610.86
 When I went into the basement,

210
610.86 --> 613.86
 there was a big old man.

211
613.86 --> 615.86
 I was surprised.

212
615.86 --> 617.86
 You don't have to be surprised.

213
617.86 --> 618.86
 Do you know what I mean?

214
618.86 --> 620.86
 You look like an old man.

215
620.86 --> 622.86
 I look like an old man, don't I?

216
622.86 --> 623.86
 It's hot.

217
624.86 --> 625.86
 Are you okay?

218
626.86 --> 628.86
 Isn't this room hot?

219
628.86 --> 631.86
 No, it's not hot.

220
631.86 --> 633.86
 Toru, is it hot?

221
633.86 --> 643.47
 No.

222
643.47 --> 644.47
 And?

223
645.47 --> 646.47
 I don't know.

224
646.47 --> 651.83
 I'm sorry. I'll go to the bathroom.

225
651.83 --> 652.83
 Are you okay?

226
652.83 --> 654.83
 I'm okay.

227
654.83 --> 655.83
 I'm sorry.

228
656.83 --> 657.83
 I'm okay.

229
666.43 --> 667.43
 Are you okay?

230
668.43 --> 670.43
 You don't look well.

231
673.43 --> 675.43
 I'm worried about you.

232
681.01 --> 684.01
 I don't want to work as a real estate agent.

233
684.01 --> 688.01
 I don't want to work hard.

234
689.01 --> 691.01
 I can't do it.

235
695.18 --> 697.18
 I'm worried about you.

236
697.18 --> 698.18
 Are you okay?

237
699.18 --> 700.18
 I don't know.

238
701.18 --> 702.18
 I'll go to the bathroom.

239
744.40 --> 745.40
 Toru, I'm sorry.

240
745.40 --> 747.40
 Moe looks sick.

241
747.40 --> 749.40
 I'll go home today.

242
750.40 --> 751.40
 I'm sorry, Toru.

243
751.40 --> 752.40
 It's okay.

244
753.40 --> 754.40
 I'll bring your luggage.

245
755.40 --> 756.40
 I'm sorry.

246
756.40 --> 757.40
 It's okay.

247
757.40 --> 758.40
 Are you okay?

248
772.42 --> 775.42
 That medicine works.

249
775.42 --> 779.72
 I don't know.

250
780.72 --> 783.72
 Is this a periodontal disease?

251
797.63 --> 798.63
 Hello?

252
798.63 --> 799.63
 Moe?

253
800.63 --> 801.63
 Yes.

254
803.63 --> 804.63
 A notebook?

255
804.63 --> 805.63
 Yes.

256
806.63 --> 807.63
 It's Ako's, right?

257
808.63 --> 809.63
 Yes.

258
809.63 --> 810.63
 I have it at home.

259
811.63 --> 812.63
 Yes.

260
812.63 --> 813.63
 Okay.

261
813.63 --> 814.63
 I'll go get it.

262
815.63 --> 816.63
 Yes.

263
819.01 --> 820.01
 How are you feeling?

264
822.32 --> 824.32
 I'm feeling better.

265
824.32 --> 825.32
 I'm glad.

266
826.32 --> 827.32
 Yes.

267
828.32 --> 831.32
 I have a day off the day after tomorrow.

268
832.32 --> 833.32
 Yes.

269
833.32 --> 834.32
 Is it too late?

270
835.32 --> 836.32
 Okay.

271
837.32 --> 838.32
 I'll wait for you.

272
839.32 --> 840.32
 See you.

273
840.32 --> 855.63
 What happens if I take more of that medicine?

274
855.63 --> 868.25
 Moe.

275
869.25 --> 871.25
 I'm sorry, Toru.

276
871.25 --> 872.25
 It doesn't matter.

277
873.25 --> 874.25
 Is this okay?

278
874.25 --> 875.25
 Yes.

279
875.25 --> 876.25
 Thank you.

280
877.25 --> 879.25
 Did you go to work today?

281
879.25 --> 880.25
 Yes.

282
881.25 --> 882.25
 I see.

283
882.25 --> 884.25
 Drink some tea.

284
884.25 --> 885.25
 Is it okay?

285
885.25 --> 886.25
 Yes.

286
887.25 --> 889.25
 I'll drink it.

287
889.25 --> 890.25
 Okay.

288
890.25 --> 891.25
 Thank you.

289
925.54 --> 936.37
 Here you are.

290
936.37 --> 937.37
 Thank you.

291
937.37 --> 948.42
 I'm glad that it's hot outside.

292
950.42 --> 953.42
 Have you decided which one to buy?

293
953.42 --> 955.42
 I haven't decided yet.

294
956.42 --> 959.42
 I thought the second one would be better at first.

295
960.42 --> 964.42
 But I think there's not enough storage space.

296
965.42 --> 966.42
 I see.

297
966.42 --> 969.42
 There's another one.

298
969.42 --> 970.42
 Really?

299
970.42 --> 971.42
 Take a look.

300
971.42 --> 972.42
 Yes.

301
972.42 --> 973.42
 I want to see it.

302
973.42 --> 978.10
 This one.

303
978.10 --> 980.48
 Yes.

304
982.48 --> 983.48
 It's great.

305
984.48 --> 987.48
 It's a bit smaller than the one I saw.

306
987.48 --> 989.48
 But the number of storages is also new.

307
989.48 --> 990.48
 I see.

308
991.48 --> 994.48
 It's really beautiful.

309
995.48 --> 1002.12
 It's cheap.

310
1003.12 --> 1007.12
 The station is close to Yosuke's workplace.

311
1007.12 --> 1008.12
 That's true.

312
1008.12 --> 1011.12
 I think this is the closest.

313
1011.12 --> 1025.51
 It looks like this.

314
1026.51 --> 1033.87
 I like this kind of apartment.

315
1033.87 --> 1034.87
 Don't you think so?

316
1034.87 --> 1035.87
 Yes.

317
1037.87 --> 1038.87
 Do you want to see the second one?

318
1038.87 --> 1039.87
 Yes.

319
1039.87 --> 1040.87
 Wait a minute.

320
1050.61 --> 1051.61
 This one.

321
1051.61 --> 1052.61
 Yes.

322
1053.61 --> 1055.61
 It's a wide window.

323
1055.61 --> 1056.61
 There's a 2LDK.

324
1056.61 --> 1057.61
 Yes.

325
1058.61 --> 1059.61
 2LDK?

326
1059.61 --> 1060.61
 Yes.

327
1061.61 --> 1063.61
 I've never lived in a 2LDK.

328
1063.61 --> 1064.61
 Really?

329
1064.61 --> 1068.61
 It's wider than the one I saw.

330
1068.61 --> 1069.61
 That's true.

331
1069.61 --> 1072.61
 The supermarket is also close.

332
1072.61 --> 1073.61
 Yes.

333
1073.61 --> 1076.61
 The balcony is also wide.

334
1076.61 --> 1078.61
 You can have a barbecue here.

335
1078.61 --> 1079.61
 Barbecue?

336
1079.61 --> 1080.61
 Yes.

337
1080.61 --> 1082.61
 I want to have a barbecue here.

338
1083.61 --> 1085.61
 It's a good place to have a barbecue in summer.

339
1085.61 --> 1086.61
 Yes.

340
1087.61 --> 1093.97
 It's a basic apartment.

341
1093.97 --> 1095.97
 Of course, it's a pet apartment.

342
1095.97 --> 1097.97
 It has a security system.

343
1098.97 --> 1103.97
 It's close to the hospital.

344
1103.97 --> 1105.97
 There is a drugstore and a supermarket.

345
1105.97 --> 1108.97
 It's close to that area.

346
1108.97 --> 1109.97
 It's from Yosuke.

347
1109.97 --> 1117.14
 Hello?

348
1118.14 --> 1119.14
 Yes.

349
1119.14 --> 1121.14
 I'm at TORU's house now.

350
1123.84 --> 1124.84
 Yes.

351
1125.84 --> 1129.84
 I'm showing you my new property.

352
1130.84 --> 1131.84
 Yes.

353
1132.84 --> 1133.84
 Yes.

354
1133.84 --> 1134.84
 Well...

355
1134.84 --> 1135.84
 Yes.

356
1137.84 --> 1140.84
 Please contact me when you have time.

357
1140.84 --> 1141.84
 Yes.

358
1141.84 --> 1144.15
 See you later.

359
1144.15 --> 1151.90
 Are you okay?

360
1151.90 --> 1154.54
 Yes, I'm fine.

361
1154.54 --> 1155.54
 It's a new apartment.

362
1157.54 --> 1159.54
 The equipment is also new.

363
1159.54 --> 1163.54
 The air conditioner is also new.

364
1164.54 --> 1169.26
 The bed is also free.

365
1169.26 --> 1175.96
 I'm sorry, TORU.

366
1175.96 --> 1178.96
 I can't decide on my own.

367
1178.96 --> 1180.96
 I'll come to see it with Yosuke again.

368
1182.96 --> 1184.96
 There is another property.

369
1184.96 --> 1185.96
 Please take a look at it.

370
1186.96 --> 1189.78
 Okay.

371
1189.78 --> 1191.78
 It's a very famous property.

372
1191.78 --> 1199.85
 This property was built last year.

373
1199.85 --> 1201.85
 It's close to a new building.

374
1202.85 --> 1209.27
 The soundproofing equipment is also perfect.

375
1209.27 --> 1213.27
 I think it's easy to buy a pet.

376
1214.27 --> 1215.27
 I think so, too.

377
1215.27 --> 1216.27
 Yes.

378
1216.27 --> 1221.97
 The bedroom is a little bigger than the previous property.

379
1222.97 --> 1223.97
 Yes.

380
1224.97 --> 1226.97
 The balcony is also spacious.

381
1226.97 --> 1227.97
 Yes.

382
1227.97 --> 1236.37
 The soundproofing equipment is also perfect.

383
1236.37 --> 1243.18
 The storage box is also perfect.

384
1243.18 --> 1246.18
 I can carry my luggage when I'm not at home.

385
1246.18 --> 1249.26
 Yes.

386
1250.26 --> 1261.82
 The walk-in closet is also spacious.

387
1262.82 --> 1266.20
 I think it's easy to take out my clothes.

388
1268.20 --> 1269.20
 Yes.

389
1270.20 --> 1271.20
 It's spacious.

390
1271.20 --> 1272.20
 Isn't it?

391
1272.20 --> 1273.20
 Yes.

392
1273.20 --> 1276.58
 This is a 2LDK property.

393
1277.58 --> 1281.58
 The rent is a little higher than the previous property.

394
1281.58 --> 1284.58
 I think this property is better.

395
1285.58 --> 1294.42
 Hey.

396
1295.42 --> 1296.42
 What's wrong?

397
1296.42 --> 1301.24
 I feel sick again.

398
1301.24 --> 1306.69
 Are you okay?

399
1306.69 --> 1311.22
 My body is hot.

400
1311.22 --> 1313.91
 I see.

401
1314.91 --> 1317.91
 You seem to be writing in the morning.

402
1322.95 --> 1327.29
 I'm going home.

403
1328.29 --> 1330.29
 You seem to be sick.

404
1331.29 --> 1332.29
 You should take a rest.

405
1332.29 --> 1333.29
 I'm fine.

406
1335.29 --> 1339.46
 I'm fine.

407
1348.34 --> 1351.04
 I'm fine.

408
1355.35 --> 1357.35
 I'll lie down for a while.

409
1358.35 --> 1360.35
 You seem to be sick.

410
1361.35 --> 1362.35
 Don't leave me alone.

411
1363.35 --> 1364.35
 I'm fine.

412
1366.92 --> 1371.92
 If your body is so hot, you should take off your clothes.

413
1374.92 --> 1379.51
 You seem to be very hot.

414
1379.51 --> 1396.48
 You seem to be very hot.

415
1396.48 --> 1397.48
 Are you okay?

416
1397.48 --> 1398.48
 Yes.

417
1399.48 --> 1421.95
 I'm fine.

418
1422.95 --> 1423.95
 I'm fine.

419
1448.17 --> 1449.17
 You are very thin.

420
1461.06 --> 1462.06
 I'm fine.

421
1463.06 --> 1464.06
 Your body is very hot.

422
1465.06 --> 1466.06
 I'm fine.

423
1469.06 --> 1470.06
 I'm fine.

424
1480.82 --> 1494.70
 You seem to be very hot.

425
1499.70 --> 1503.70
 You should take off your clothes.

426
1505.70 --> 1512.94
 Your body is very hot.

427
1512.94 --> 1513.94
 I'm fine.

428
1538.34 --> 1539.34
 I'm fine.

429
1576.94 --> 1577.94
 I didn't do anything to you.

430
1597.66 --> 1600.66
 Your body is very hot.

431
1625.47 --> 1626.47
 Are you okay?

432
1628.47 --> 1629.47
 You should relax.

433
1630.47 --> 1631.47
 You should take off your clothes.

434
1634.47 --> 1635.47
 I can't.

435
1636.47 --> 1637.47
 I can't.

436
1638.47 --> 1639.47
 It's okay.

437
1641.47 --> 1642.47
 I can't.

438
1643.47 --> 1655.51
 Your body is very hot.

439
1655.51 --> 1656.51
 I can't.

440
1657.51 --> 1666.86
 You should relax.

441
1666.86 --> 1667.86
 I can't.

442
1673.75 --> 1687.33
 I can't.

443
1688.33 --> 1691.09
 Are you hot?

444
1691.09 --> 1692.09
 I can't.

445
1692.09 --> 1695.09
 You should relax.

446
1696.09 --> 1712.22
 I can't.

447
1712.22 --> 1718.89
 I can't.

448
1718.89 --> 1723.76
 I can't.

449
1723.76 --> 1724.76
 I can't.

450
1733.76 --> 1734.76
 It's hot.

451
1734.76 --> 1735.76
 It's hot.

452
1735.76 --> 1736.76
 It's hot.

453
1737.76 --> 1738.76
 I can't.

454
1738.76 --> 1739.76
 I can't.

455
1740.76 --> 1741.76
 Your body is very hot.

456
1762.95 --> 1763.95
 I just touched you.

457
1765.95 --> 1766.95
 Do you eat a lot of food?

458
1775.51 --> 1778.21
 Are you okay?

459
1782.06 --> 1783.06
 Your body is very hot.

460
1792.47 --> 1795.04
 I'm okay.

461
1798.70 --> 1799.70
 I'm talking to you.

462
1804.26 --> 1805.26
 I can't.

463
1817.79 --> 1818.79
 I can't.

464
1818.79 --> 1819.79
 It's okay.

465
1821.79 --> 1822.79
 This is your body.

466
1822.79 --> 1823.79
 I can't.

467
1823.79 --> 1824.79
 This is your body.

468
1824.79 --> 1825.79
 Your body is hot.

469
1865.25 --> 1866.25
 I can't.

470
1867.25 --> 1883.62
 It's hot, Moe-chan.

471
1883.62 --> 1884.62
 It's hot, Moe-chan.

472
1884.62 --> 1885.62
 It's hard for you.

473
1885.62 --> 1917.82
 It's hard for you, Moe-chan.

474
1917.82 --> 1918.82
 It's hot, isn't it?

475
1928.68 --> 1929.68
 It feels good, doesn't it?

476
1929.68 --> 1930.68
 I'm sorry.

477
1930.68 --> 1931.68
 I'm sorry.

478
1945.48 --> 1947.48
 You want to feel better, don't you?

479
1978.49 --> 1982.70
 It's amazing.

480
1982.70 --> 1984.70
 Moe-chan.

481
1984.70 --> 1986.70
 I didn't know you could do such a thing.

482
1997.18 --> 1999.18
 I didn't know you could do such a thing.

483
2004.18 --> 2005.18
 It's hot.

484
2005.18 --> 2006.18
 It's hot.

485
2018.18 --> 2019.18
 It's hot, isn't it?

486
2045.14 --> 2048.14
 Moe-chan's mouth is so warm.

487
2058.90 --> 2059.90
 It's hot.

488
2061.90 --> 2062.90
 It's hot.

489
2084.58 --> 2086.58
 I'm going to give you a peck.

490
2086.58 --> 2087.58
 I'm going to give you a peck.

491
2087.58 --> 2089.58
 You're getting better and better.

492
2093.58 --> 2094.58
 It's hot.

493
2115.73 --> 2116.73
 I'm going to give you a peck.

494
2116.73 --> 2118.73
 I'm going to give you a peck.

495
2118.73 --> 2119.73
 It's hot.

496
2152.42 --> 2153.42
 It's hot.

497
2155.42 --> 2156.42
 It's hot, isn't it?

498
2170.42 --> 2173.38
 It's delicious.

499
2176.38 --> 2177.38
 It's delicious.

500
2249.20 --> 2251.20
 Moe-chan, don't talk to me.

501
2254.20 --> 2255.20
 Don't talk to me.

502
2257.20 --> 2258.20
 It's delicious.

503
2268.20 --> 2269.20
 It's the best.

504
2273.20 --> 2275.20
 It's not just your mouth.

505
2276.20 --> 2278.20
 Your mouth is lonely, isn't it?

506
2280.20 --> 2281.20
 Let me go.

507
2304.32 --> 2305.32
 Let me go.

508
2312.32 --> 2315.02
 It's hot.

509
2315.02 --> 2317.02
 It's hot, isn't it?

510
2317.02 --> 2318.02
 It's hot.

511
2324.66 --> 2325.66
 I'm going to give you a peck.

512
2325.66 --> 2327.66
 I'm going to give you a peck.

513
2346.22 --> 2347.22
 You want this, don't you?

514
2392.16 --> 2393.16
 Let me go.

515
2393.16 --> 2394.16
 Let me go.

516
2400.88 --> 2414.65
 It's hot, isn't it?

517
2414.65 --> 2415.65
 You want this, don't you?

518
2694.97 --> 2695.97
 It feels good, doesn't it?

519
2695.97 --> 2696.97
 Let me go.

520
2696.97 --> 2697.97
 I'm going to give you a peck.

521
2698.97 --> 2699.97
 I'm going to give you a peck.

522
2715.30 --> 2718.83
 It's hot, isn't it?

523
2781.71 --> 2782.71
 I can't stop.

524
2793.34 --> 2794.34
 Let me go.

525
2798.34 --> 2799.34
 I'm going to give you a peck.

526
2800.34 --> 2801.34
 You want this, don't you?

527
2982.48 --> 2983.48
 It feels good, doesn't it?

528
2983.48 --> 2984.48
 Let me go.

529
2994.66 --> 3000.30
 I'm going to give you a peck.

530
3001.30 --> 3007.52
 It's hot.

531
3008.52 --> 3009.52
 I'm going to give you a peck.

532
3102.50 --> 3103.50
 Did you wake up?

533
3105.50 --> 3106.50
 What's this?

534
3107.50 --> 3108.50
 What's going on?

535
3110.50 --> 3111.50
 Take this.

536
3113.50 --> 3115.50
 I ran out of medicine.

537
3115.50 --> 3116.50
 Medicine?

538
3122.02 --> 3123.02
 I'll give you medicine.

539
3123.02 --> 3125.02
 I'll make you feel better.

540
3127.02 --> 3128.02
 What is it?

541
3129.02 --> 3130.02
 What did you do to me?

542
3131.02 --> 3132.02
 I don't like it.

543
3132.02 --> 3133.02
 I don't like it.

544
3134.02 --> 3135.02
 Open your mouth.

545
3136.02 --> 3137.02
 I don't like it.

546
3147.02 --> 3148.02
 What did you put on me?

547
3149.02 --> 3151.39
 I don't like it.

548
3152.39 --> 3156.39
 You were in my bed earlier.

549
3157.39 --> 3159.39
 You looked like you were having a good time.

550
3159.39 --> 3160.39
 Don't you remember?

551
3165.24 --> 3178.75
 Take this.

552
3179.75 --> 3184.75
 How effective is this medicine?

553
3185.75 --> 3187.75
 I don't like it.

554
3188.75 --> 3189.75
 I don't like it.

555
3192.75 --> 3193.75
 Let me go.

556
3194.75 --> 3195.75
 I don't like it.

557
3199.47 --> 3200.47
 I can see you.

558
3202.85 --> 3203.85
 I'll give you medicine.

559
3204.85 --> 3205.85
 I don't like it.

560
3205.85 --> 3206.85
 What is it?

561
3207.85 --> 3208.85
 I'll give you a lot.

562
3209.85 --> 3210.85
 I don't like it.

563
3211.85 --> 3212.85
 I don't like it.

564
3213.85 --> 3214.85
 I don't like it.

565
3215.85 --> 3216.85
 It's okay, Moe-chan.

566
3217.85 --> 3218.85
 Don't come here.

567
3225.70 --> 3228.70
 You'll feel better.

568
3232.70 --> 3233.70
 Open your mouth.

569
3235.70 --> 3240.51
 I don't like it.

570
3243.85 --> 3244.85
 It hurts.

571
3247.42 --> 3248.42
 I don't like it.

572
3248.42 --> 3249.42
 Take it off.

573
3249.42 --> 3250.42
 It's in your mouth.

574
3259.59 --> 3260.59
 You look good.

575
3284.39 --> 3285.39
 I don't like it.

576
3297.39 --> 3298.39
 It's okay, Moe-chan.

577
3299.39 --> 3300.39
 You'll feel better soon.

578
3350.64 --> 3351.64
 I don't like it.

579
3356.45 --> 3357.45
 You're weak.

580
3390.10 --> 3391.10
 You're weak.

581
3393.10 --> 3394.10
 You feel good, don't you?

582
3394.10 --> 3395.10
 I don't like it.

583
3405.54 --> 3406.54
 Open your mouth.

584
3424.46 --> 3426.83
 You're very nervous.

585
3429.83 --> 3459.92
 It's hot.

586
3460.92 --> 3476.54
 It seems to have worked.

587
3477.54 --> 3478.54
 I don't like it.

588
3479.54 --> 3480.54
 I don't like it.

589
3526.73 --> 3527.73
 Do you feel good?

590
3527.73 --> 3528.73
 I don't like it.

591
3529.73 --> 3530.73
 Do you feel good?

592
3531.73 --> 3578.39
 You feel good, don't you?

593
3579.39 --> 3583.62
 It's hot.

594
3590.62 --> 3591.62
 Can you see?

595
3597.14 --> 3598.14
 Do you feel good?

596
3599.14 --> 3600.14
 I don't like it.

597
3610.75 --> 3611.75
 Take it off.

598
3617.75 --> 3618.75
 I don't like it.

599
3621.75 --> 3622.75
 I don't like it.

600
3622.75 --> 3623.75
 You're weak.

601
3626.75 --> 3628.75
 Show me your face.

602
3631.75 --> 3634.83
 I don't like it.

603
3637.83 --> 3638.83
 Open your mouth more.

604
3639.83 --> 3640.83
 You'll forget it.

605
3640.83 --> 3641.83
 I don't like it.

606
3654.62 --> 3655.62
 You feel good, don't you?

607
3655.62 --> 3663.24
 I don't like it.

608
3663.24 --> 3664.24
 You feel good, don't you?

609
3666.24 --> 3667.24
 Open your mouth more.

610
3704.70 --> 3723.34
 It's hot.

611
3754.97 --> 3755.97
 I don't like it.

612
3755.97 --> 3756.97
 I don't like it.

613
3802.85 --> 3803.85
 You're so dirty.

614
3842.94 --> 3843.94
 You want to feel good, don't you?

615
3844.94 --> 3856.09
 I don't like it.

616
3962.56 --> 3963.56
 I see.

617
3964.56 --> 3969.56
 Moe, you weren't at home for 30 minutes after that phone call.

618
3975.82 --> 3976.82
 I see.

619
3977.82 --> 3979.82
 I can't get in touch with you.

620
3981.82 --> 3983.82
 I'm worried about that.

621
3988.82 --> 3990.82
 It's about a new property.

622
3995.82 --> 3996.82
 I see.

623
3998.82 --> 4000.82
 Please contact me again.

624
4002.82 --> 4003.82
 See you.

625
4014.81 --> 4016.81
 It's time for medicine.

626
4024.10 --> 4026.10
 Moe, show me your tongue.

627
4054.58 --> 4056.58
 It's been six days.

628
4057.58 --> 4060.58
 Moe, show me your finger.

629
4080.27 --> 4083.27
 I have to deceive Yosuke.

630
4115.41 --> 4118.41
 You had a lot of sex yesterday, didn't you?

631
4119.41 --> 4127.41
 Moe, I'll make you beautiful.

632
4154.40 --> 4155.40
 What's wrong?

633
4156.40 --> 4157.40
 Why are you so surprised?

634
4161.42 --> 4162.42
 What's wrong?

635
4163.42 --> 4164.42
 What's wrong?

636
4165.42 --> 4169.42
 You have to wash your hands carefully.

637
4170.42 --> 4189.49
 You're washing your hands, but they're still wet.

638
4190.49 --> 4216.51
 Moe, wash your hands by yourself.

639
4291.79 --> 4292.79
 I'm back.

640
4294.79 --> 4295.79
 It's Yosuke.

641
4296.79 --> 4299.79
 I'm going to show you the documents of the new property.

642
4300.79 --> 4303.79
 I went to Toru's store and he said he was taking a day off.

643
4304.79 --> 4307.79
 You called me yesterday and said you couldn't get in touch with Moe.

644
4310.79 --> 4313.79
 I got an e-mail from Moe that he was sick.

645
4314.79 --> 4315.79
 I see.

646
4317.79 --> 4318.79
 Can I come in?

647
4319.79 --> 4323.79
 I'm going to change the pattern of the room.

648
4324.79 --> 4325.79
 Can I just hand it to you?

649
4329.36 --> 4330.36
 What was that sound?

650
4331.36 --> 4334.36
 My luggage fell down.

651
4335.36 --> 4336.36
 Wait a minute.

652
4355.12 --> 4356.12
 I want it.

653
4357.12 --> 4360.01
 I want it.

654
4369.91 --> 4370.91
 It's dangerous to leave it alone.

655
4371.91 --> 4372.91
 Come here.

656
4373.91 --> 4374.91
 I want it.

657
4375.91 --> 4376.91
 Come here.

658
4379.91 --> 4381.91
 Shake your butt like a dog.

659
4394.54 --> 4395.54
 I want it.

660
4403.30 --> 4404.30
 I want it.

661
4452.62 --> 4455.38
 I want it.

662
4455.38 --> 4456.38
 I want it.

663
4462.38 --> 4463.38
 I want it.

664
4463.38 --> 4464.38
 I want it.

665
4486.84 --> 4487.84
 I want it.

666
4492.66 --> 4493.66
 I want it.

667
4494.66 --> 4495.66
 I'll give it to Moe.

668
4496.66 --> 4499.10
 It's Moe.

669
4500.10 --> 4502.10
 What's wrong?

670
4502.10 --> 4506.10
 Oh, I'm looking for it now, but I can't find it.

671
4506.10 --> 4516.11
 Wasn't Yosuke at work today?

672
4516.11 --> 4518.11
 It's a job.

673
4518.11 --> 4522.11
 The sales round ended early, and I had time, so I was able to come.

674
4522.11 --> 4524.11
 Oh, I see.

675
4524.11 --> 4527.11
 It's nice to be able to skip sales.

676
4527.11 --> 4529.11
 I don't think so.

677
4529.11 --> 4531.11
 I don't think so.

678
4531.11 --> 4533.11
 I don't think so.

679
4533.11 --> 4535.11
 I don't think so.

680
4536.11 --> 4538.11
 I don't think so.

681
4538.11 --> 4541.11
 It's hard to follow the rules every month.

682
4542.11 --> 4544.11
 Oh, I see.

683
4544.11 --> 4549.11
 Oh, by the way, is Moe-chan okay?

684
4551.11 --> 4558.11
 It's been weird since then.

685
4558.11 --> 4560.11
 It hasn't been like that before.

686
4562.11 --> 4564.11
 Oh, I see.

687
4581.54 --> 4583.54
 Oh, I see.

688
4607.90 --> 4609.90
 It's a little bit of a tongue.

689
4610.90 --> 4612.90
 It's a little bit of a tongue.

690
4613.90 --> 4615.90
 I can't do anything.

691
4615.90 --> 4617.90
 I see.

692
4621.90 --> 4623.90
 I can't do anything.

693
4624.90 --> 4626.90
 I see.

694
4626.90 --> 4628.90
 Doru.

695
4628.90 --> 4630.90
 Can't you find it yet?

696
4630.90 --> 4632.90
 I can't find it.

697
4632.90 --> 4634.90
 I'm sorry.

698
4634.90 --> 4638.73
 Maybe next time.

699
4638.73 --> 4639.73
 I'm sorry.

700
4639.73 --> 4641.73
 I'll be back.

701
4641.73 --> 4643.73
 See you, Yosuke.

702
4643.73 --> 4647.81
 See you.

703
4653.38 --> 4655.38
 Moe-chan.

704
4655.38 --> 4657.38
 You had a boyfriend.

705
4657.38 --> 4659.38
 You're talking so much.

706
4660.38 --> 4662.38
 You're such a bad girl.

707
4664.38 --> 4666.38
 I'm scared.

708
4667.38 --> 4668.38
 There?

709
4668.38 --> 4672.21
 I'm scared.

710
4672.21 --> 4673.21
 I'm scared.

711
4673.21 --> 4675.21
 You're such a bad girl.

712
4682.55 --> 4684.55
 I'll make you feel better.

713
4692.10 --> 4694.10
 I can't do it.

714
4704.10 --> 4706.10
 You can't do it.

715
4770.05 --> 4772.05
 I can't do it, too.

716
4780.63 --> 4781.63
 I can't do it.

717
4791.34 --> 4836.90
 You want to cry, don't you?

718
4836.90 --> 4838.90
 I can't do it.

719
4838.90 --> 4840.90
 I'm going to take it out.

720
4871.86 --> 4873.86
 I'm sorry.

721
4899.74 --> 4926.54
 I'm sorry.

722
4930.54 --> 4932.54
 I'm sorry.

723
4936.54 --> 4946.90
 I'm sorry.

724
4982.14 --> 4984.14
 I don't have anything I want.

725
5157.32 --> 5182.58
 Mom, I'm sorry.

726
5370.27 --> 5374.54
 I'm sorry.

727
5741.36 --> 5743.36
 What are you doing?

728
5743.36 --> 5745.36
 I'm sorry.

729
5771.49 --> 5773.49
 I don't know who I am.

730
5813.02 --> 5815.02
 I'm sorry.

731
5815.02 --> 5817.02
 I'm sorry.

732
5817.02 --> 5819.02
 I'm sorry.

733
5833.09 --> 5835.09
 You're a good licker.

734
5847.09 --> 5849.09
 You're a good licker.

735
5849.09 --> 5851.09
 You're a good licker.

736
5851.09 --> 5853.09
 You're drooling here, too.

737
5870.78 --> 5872.78
 You're a good licker.

738
5878.78 --> 5880.78
 I'm sorry.

739
5905.92 --> 5907.92
 I'm sorry.

740
5915.54 --> 5924.13
 I'm sorry.

741
5927.70 --> 5929.70
 Let me see.

742
5929.70 --> 5943.70
 If you want to have a baby, you have to wash your face with this water.

743
5944.70 --> 5952.52
 Let me wash my face.

744
5953.52 --> 5955.52
 Let's use this water.

745
5965.52 --> 5985.52
 It's hot.

746
5996.52 --> 5997.52
 It's hot.

747
6022.05 --> 6024.05
 It's disgusting, but it's okay.

748
6043.66 --> 6117.26
 I'm scared.

749
6118.26 --> 6122.22
 I'm scared.

750
6123.22 --> 6124.22
 My butt.

751
6125.22 --> 6126.22
 My butt.

752
6127.22 --> 6128.22
 My butt.

753
6129.22 --> 6130.22
 My butt.

754
6131.22 --> 6132.22
 I'm not giving it to you yet.

755
6133.22 --> 6134.22
 No, no.

756
6134.22 --> 6137.66
 I don't want to.

757
6138.66 --> 6139.66
 It's clean.

758
6168.34 --> 6169.34
 Please.

759
6170.34 --> 6171.34
 I want to have a baby.

760
6172.34 --> 6173.34
 Do you want a baby?

761
6174.34 --> 6176.34
 I want to have a baby.

762
6177.34 --> 6178.34
 No, not yet.

763
6179.34 --> 6180.34
 Why?

764
6180.34 --> 6182.34
 I don't want to.

765
6183.34 --> 6184.34
 You're going to be sick.

766
6185.34 --> 6186.34
 I'm going to be sick.

767
6190.34 --> 6191.34
 I can't stop.

768
6192.34 --> 6200.26
 I'm going to die.

769
6223.12 --> 6224.12
 Is it hot?

770
6225.12 --> 6226.12
 No.

771
6227.12 --> 6228.12
 It's hot in here, right?

772
6229.12 --> 6244.04
 It's hot.

773
6245.04 --> 6277.56
 I don't want to.

774
6286.82 --> 6289.46
 I want to have a baby.

775
6290.46 --> 6291.46
 No, I don't want to.

776
6292.46 --> 6294.46
 It feels so good!

777
6294.46 --> 6296.46
 It feels so good!

778
6296.46 --> 6298.46
 Oh, no!

779
6298.46 --> 6316.30
 You should be more careful.

780
6316.30 --> 6335.58
 I want to be hugged more.

781
6335.58 --> 6394.31
 Oh, it feels so good!

782
6398.14 --> 6478.12
 Oh, my!

783
6478.12 --> 6483.48
 Oh, my!

784
6483.48 --> 6485.48
 Do you want it?

785
6489.48 --> 6493.43
 I'll put it in.

786
6493.43 --> 6495.43
 Do you want to put it in?

787
6495.43 --> 6564.22
 Oh, it feels so good!

788
6564.22 --> 6619.94
 I'll put it in.

789
6635.85 --> 6637.85
 I don't want to put it in.

790
6637.85 --> 6639.85
 Please put it in.

791
6641.85 --> 6811.05
 Oh, my!

792
6811.05 --> 6924.09
 Oh, my!

793
6936.92 --> 6938.92
 Oh, my!

794
6942.62 --> 6944.62
 Wow! Wow!

795
6944.62 --> 6945.62
 That's great!

796
6945.62 --> 6947.62
 Oh, my God!

797
6948.62 --> 6951.62
 I'm going to die!

798
6970.89 --> 6985.23
 I'm going to die!

799
7014.74 --> 7015.74
 I can't stop.

800
7016.74 --> 7017.74
 I'm so sleepy.

801
7017.74 --> 7018.74
 I'm so sleepy.

802
7018.74 --> 7019.74
 I'm so sleepy.

803
7019.74 --> 7020.74
 It's okay.

804
7354.79 --> 7356.79
 Ahhhh!

805
7356.79 --> 7358.79
 Oh my goodness!

806
7358.79 --> 7360.79
 Ah!

807
7360.79 --> 7362.79
 Ah!

808
7362.79 --> 7364.79
 Ah!

809
7364.79 --> 7366.79
 Ah!

810
7366.79 --> 7368.79
 Ah!

811
7368.79 --> 7370.79
 Ah!

812
7370.79 --> 7372.79
 Ah!

813
7372.79 --> 7374.79
 Ah!

814
7374.79 --> 7376.79
 Let me go!

815
7376.79 --> 7383.11
 Ah, I can't!

816
7383.11 --> 7421.37
 Ah, it hurts!

817
7421.37 --> 7465.93
 Ah, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!
