1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,480
We're here, everyone.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,600
It's here.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
Wow!

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,360
There are so many.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Let's go.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:48,260
I heard that this year's
hot spring trip is a success.

7
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,220
I want to go to the hot
spring as soon as possible.

8
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,520
But it seems that this
place is quite crowded.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,740
Everyone, let's check in.

10
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,600
Yes.

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
We said we were coming together.

12
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,680
Then we decided to come to the room.

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,100
Can you go to another room
from now on? Thank you.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,100


15
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,150
But I'm already in the room.

16
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,410
I know that.

17
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:50,050
I'm looking forward to it, but I
need to meet Tokushin Umiya.

18
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,670
I want to get married like Aoi.

19
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,210
Please.

20
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,590
I'm in trouble.

21
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,210
Well, I wonder if it will work out.

22
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,150
Well, good luck.

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,870
Thank you.

24
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,410
I'll take care of this Umiya.

25
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,411
I'll make sure to do it.

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,660
Don't mess up the room.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,750
I won't.

28
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,910
See you.

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,750
The room wasn't open.

30
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,970
What should I do? Oh, Mr.

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,300
Abe.

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
What are you doing with
the luggage in such a place?

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,880
Actually, Actually,
my room is gone.

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
What?

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,220
My room is empty.

36
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,480
I feel sorry for you.

37
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,200
Well, two people in the same
room got to know each other.

38
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:10,340
I've heard that you've known
each other for a long time.

39
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,800
Oh, is that why you were kicked out?

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes, that's why.

41
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Oh, poor you.

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,920
Why don't you come to our room?

43
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh, that's a good idea.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,860
Our room is very spacious.

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,520
No, I can't do that.

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
What?

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,280
Chief, if you stay here, you'll
have to sleep next to Robin.

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,580
I'm worried about you.

49
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm really grateful, but I can't do that.

50
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,980
It's okay. Please come.

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,300
I'm married, so it's a little bad.

52
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,100
But we don't deny it at all, so it's okay.

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,520
The room was wide, so it's okay.

54
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,900
But... Katsuo-nyan is always taking
care of me, so let me thank you.

55
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,640
But it's a little bad.

56
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,980
When you're in trouble,
it's for both of us.

57
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,390
What should I do?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,360
Come on, let's go.

59
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:12,580
Let's go.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm hungry.

61
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,210
Let's go.

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
I'll take the luggage.

63
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,400
But... We'll go this way.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
Let's go.

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,520
Don't be shy.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,620
I'm shy.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,360
You helped me a lot at work.

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,900
What's wrong with you today?

69
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
You made me suffer.

70
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,420
I'm fine.

71
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,860
Are you thirsty?

72
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,540
Would you like some
tea? Here you are.

73
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:50,805
Thank you.

74
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,220


75
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Don't be so nervous.

76
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,720
It's a little close.

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,320
Why? Is that so?

78
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,920
It's a little close.

79
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,240
I didn't mean to hit you.

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
It's okay.

81
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:11,120
Oh, I see.

82
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,240
Oh, I see.

83
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,280
The sweets here were very
delicious, weren't they? Yes, they were.

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560


85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,660
You like sweets,
don't you? Yes, I do.

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,220
I remember.

87
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520


88
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,100
I'll give you a bite.

89
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Here you are.

90
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,400
Please open your mouth.

91
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,270
No, no, no.

92
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
It's OK.

93
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,220
Do you eat it by
yourself? Yes, thank you.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Oh, no.

95
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,200


96
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,350
Do you want some tea?

97
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,620
No, I'll drink it myself.

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
You can get rid of the water.

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,840
Yes, but I want to drink it with you.

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
What's the matter?

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
What's the matter?

102
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Chief!

103
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,430
Don't you have a stiff shoulder?

104
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:03,620
You always take care of
us, don't you? No, I don't.

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,940


106
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,730
I love bonito!

107
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,980
I'll give it to you.

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Here we go.

109
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,400
It's already in your mouth.

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,240
It's already in your mouth.

111
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
Thank you.

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,860
Are you going to eat it?

113
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,020
Tenka, you're so cute.

114
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,700
I'll put a little more pressure.

115
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:33,701
I'm going to put it in.

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,180
You're a professional.

117
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't want anything more than this.

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
What's wrong with you?

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,460
You're angry, aren't you?

120
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
What's wrong? Nothing.

121
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,530


122
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,330
Why are you hiding it?

123
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:53,900
What?

124
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,580
Why are you hiding it?

125
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,780
What's wrong? Nothing.

126
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,550


127
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,260
What's wrong with you?

128
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Stop it!

129
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,340
What's wrong with you?

130
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,341
Please move away.

131
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,000
No, it's not like that.

132
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Wow!

133
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,940
What's wrong with you?

134
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,600
Stop it!

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,740
Boss!

136
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,900
What are you doing?

137
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,200
It's amazing!

138
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,220
Why do you have so much on your pants?

139
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:27,400
What are you doing? This is.

140
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,140
..

141
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,840
What is this?

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,780
Do you like my
boobs? No, I don't.

143
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,720
Do you like my
boobs? No, I don't.

144
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,981
I'm going to hit you.

145
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,040
I'm going to hit you, too.

146
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,320
Wait a minute.

147
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,860
Your boobs are getting bigger.

148
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,580
They're getting harder and harder.

149
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,730
Ah...

150
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,580
Oh, stop it... Um,
we are married.

151
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,620
This is dangerous.

152
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
But, you're not.

153
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,050
But, you are.

154
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,100
We're the ones who made you do that.

155
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,120
We should be responsible.

156
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,140
You shouldn't do that.

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
That's right.

158
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,520
You shouldn't do that.

159
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,560
It's not that kind of problem.

160
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:25,940
You always take care of us a lot.

161
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,421
Today, we are
going to... ...eat this.

162
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,310
No, no, no.

163
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
That and this.

164
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Wait, wait, wait.

165
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Wow!

166
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,160
It's all over the place.

167
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,840
BINBIN KACHO NO CHINCHIN

168
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
What?

169
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,650
Do you have a weak nipple?

170
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
What's wrong?

171
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
No, it's not like that.

172
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,140
I want to see it.

173
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
It's hard.

174
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,160
No.

175
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm married, so I can't do this.

176
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,500
Why?

177
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
It doesn't matter.

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,940
Calm down.

179
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,300
Katsuo, if you touch his nipples,
he'll get more and more angry.

180
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,180
Katsuo, it's better to leave him alone.

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
That's right.

182
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
Let him be.

183
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,920
If you leave him alone, he'll kill you.

184
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,360
Come on, look this way.

185
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,740
Please give me a kiss.

186
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm married, so I can't do that.

187
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,220
You're getting bigger and bigger.

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,640
Why do you say such a thing?

189
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,660
It feels good, doesn't it?

190
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,180
Hachio?

191
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,480
Hachio's tongue is soft, isn't it?

192
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,040
It's already swollen.

193
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,041
I'm waiting for you.

194
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm waiting for you.

195
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,560
Your lips are really soft.

196
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:55,775
I'm waiting for you.

197
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm waiting for you.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm waiting for you.

199
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm waiting for you.

200
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:00,761
What?

201
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,680
Why are you doing this? Wait.

202
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Stop it.

203
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720


204
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,220
What's wrong?

205
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,580
Can I stop?

206
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,280
You are so cute.

207
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
Can you stop being so grumpy?

208
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,460
Calm down, everyone.

209
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,940
You are drooling.

210
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,160
No, I'm not.

211
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Why?

212
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,700
You are so cute.

213
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,880
Honey, don't go out so early.

214
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,360
Don't go out so early.

215
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,240
Don't go out so early.

216
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,820
Kachou-san doesn't want to let you sleep.

217
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,520
Don't you want to?

218
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,100
Don't you want to let me sleep?

219
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
What is it? It's a bonito.

220
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640


221
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,600
Look, your boobs are warm.

222
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Your boobs are warm.

223
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,860
You look so happy.

224
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,620
You look so happy.

225
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:39,621
You look so happy.

226
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,640
It's a bonito.

227
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,480
Do you like boobs?

228
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Do you?

229
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,030
What?

230
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,000
Do you want to see my boobs?

231
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,740
Do you like boobs?

232
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,220
Do you want to see our boobs?

233
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,240
No, I don't want to.

234
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,510
Kacchou!

235
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,100
You like boobs, don't you?

236
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,360
I'll show them to you for you.

237
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,500
Only for you.

238
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,660
Kacchou is so cute.

239
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,140
Kacchou!

240
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,120
Don't you want to touch my boobs?

241
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,820
I'm going to take it off.

242
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,740
Calm down, everyone.

243
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,980
Your boobs are very flat.

244
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Oh, Papa! No, that's.

245
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,460
..

246
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,270
Don't you want to touch the chief's boobs?

247
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,780
No, I can't do that.

248
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,500
Don't you want to
touch them? Well.

249
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,360
..

250
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Chief!

251
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:28,560
The chief is looking at our boobs.

252
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:31,240
You really want to touch them, don't you?

253
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,100
Do you want me to
take off your bra for you?

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,300
You are so cute!

255
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,180
I'll take it off, too.

256
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,820
I want to see it too.

257
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,520
I want you to see it all.

258
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
I can see your mouth.

259
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't you want to touch it?

260
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:31,201
Don't you want to eat it?

261
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,860
No, but it's not good.

262
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Don't you want to eat it?

263
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,240
No, no, no, wait a minute.

264
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,840
Do you still hate boobs?

265
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,140
You like boobs, don't you?

266
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,940
Your hands are moving erotically.

267
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm holding you.

268
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm holding you.

269
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,640
No, it's not.

270
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,800
It's good.

271
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,540
Please touch me a lot.

272
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,060
You're getting bigger.

273
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,500
I'll touch you directly.

274
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,120
Oh, wait...

275
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,500
Your little bum was sticking out.

276
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,060
Hey, dad, look at this.

277
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,820
It's gone.

278
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:43,821
It's gone.

279
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,100
It looks so soft.

280
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,620
You're staring at me.

281
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,020
No, I'm not.

282
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,920
Me, too.

283
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,700
How is it?

284
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
Do you want to drink it?

285
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,241
Do you want to touch me?

286
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,980
Please touch me.

287
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,840
Do you want me to touch you a lot?

288
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:33,841
Do you like it?

289
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,420
You look like you like it.

290
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,320
You have a lot of boobies.

291
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,500
Do you like the boobies
of the otter? I can't choose.

292
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,780


293
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Why?

294
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,880
Do you have one?

295
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,320
You like the boobies of the
otter, don't you? Oh, oh, oh.

296
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:58,820


297
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,320
Well then,

298
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,130
Kako-chan,

299
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,800
Kako-chan, look.

300
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
Ah, ah.

301
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Your nose is getting hot.

302
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:21,561
It's getting cold.

303
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
It's time to go to bed.

304
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,260
I'm not cold at all.

305
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,120
You are addicted to it, aren't you?

306
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,500
You are so cute like a baby.

307
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,740
You are eating it by yourself.

308
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,190
Do you like it?

309
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,210
Please eat as much as you like.

310
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,630
You are getting more and
more comfortable, aren't you?

311
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,090
You are getting better and better.

312
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:52,030
Oh, you are tickling me, aren't you?

313
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,570
Oh, you are tickling me, aren't you?

314
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,850
Oh, you are tickling me, aren't you?

315
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,570
Oh, you are tickling me, aren't you?

316
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,710
Oh, you are tickling me, aren't you?

317
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,890
What are you doing? You are so cute!

318
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,450
Wait a minute!

319
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,451
It's too fast!

320
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,830
It's not coming out yet!

321
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,650
Wait a minute!

322
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:29,230
It's coming out!

323
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,870
Was it about to come out?

324
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,670
Was it about to come out?

325
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,410
It's too fast!

326
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,230
You shouldn't do it so easily.

327
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,910
Next, I'll do it.

328
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,510
You have a lot of blood in the middle.

329
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,270
You're breathing heavily.

330
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,150
Your body is stiff.

331
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,090
Relax, relax.

332
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,570
No, I didn't mean it.

333
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,630
I think you should be quiet.

334
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,970
Don't you like it,
Kacchou? Kacchou.

335
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,650


336
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,170
You always say you have to be honest.

337
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,910
Yes, I do.

338
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,410
You have to smile.

339
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,910
It feels good, doesn't it?

340
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,600
You are sweating a lot.

341
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,500
You are a good boy.

342
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll give it to you.

343
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,780
No, you can't.

344
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,100
I'll give it to you.

345
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,640
Oh, that's...

346
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,900
Oh, you're drooling.

347
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,740
No, you can't.

348
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,140
No, you can't.

349
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,120
What? I also.

350
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:38,121
..

351
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,020
I also...

352
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,460
I also... I also... What
are you doing? I also.

353
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,870
..

354
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,640
I also...

355
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,120
You got bit by your favorite boobs.

356
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,880
Boss, you love boobs, don't you?

357
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
No.

358
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,940
Your boobs ate your penis.

359
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,960
Does it feel good, boss?

360
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,840
It's coming out.

361
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Wow.

362
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
I can see your penis.

363
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,960
He's licking me.

364
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,620
He's licking me.

365
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,670
You're so nice.

366
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,540
You're sweating.

367
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:45,630
Are you all right?

368
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,230
You are making a lot of noise.

369
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,570
I am making a lot of noise.

370
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,910
Are you so excited?

371
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,130
Do you feel good? I'm so sorry.

372
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,210


373
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,630
It's so uncomfortable.

374
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,910
Lots of juice came out.

375
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,187
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

376
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:41,900
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

377
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,680
Look, it's all good.

378
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,160
What's the matter?

379
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
What's the matter?

380
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,200
Your boobies are shaking.

381
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
What's the matter?

382
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,320
What's the matter?

383
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you feel good?

384
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,320
You are getting more and more energetic.

385
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,940
You are shaking your body to the limit.

386
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,290
It's hot!

387
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
It's so hot!

388
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,380
You shouldn't be like that!

389
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm still a human!

390
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Really?

391
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,880
Are you a human being?

392
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,420
I want to be like that!

393
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,100
I want to pinch you with my boobs!

394
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,930
Wow, it's still warm.

395
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,310
It's still warm here.

396
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,810
Do you feel good?

397
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,550
You're drooling.

398
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:19,890
It's amazing that your
boobs can become this big.

399
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,190
It's hard.

400
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:35,970
I'm tired, too.

401
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,350
It's so hard.

402
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,870
The tip of your tongue is bleeding again.

403
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,030
I'm so happy.

404
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:56,410
You're crying a lot.

405
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,290
Does it feel good?

406
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,470
What's wrong with you?

407
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Again?

408
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:44,570
You can still do it?

409
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,290
I'm still waiting for you.

410
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,030
You haven't recovered yet, have you?

411
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,770
Your skin is getting red again.

412
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,830
I want to lick your penis, too.

413
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:13,410
I can't believe you can do that.

414
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,280
This is the taste of a penis warrior.

415
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,680
It was very strong.

416
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,080
So, you are getting married.

417
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,120
You are excited, aren't you?

418
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,160
Are you going out again?

419
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,240
I like to be teased.

420
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,960
Wait a minute.

421
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,050
What's wrong with you?
You have a runny nose.

422
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:26,051
Are you excited?

423
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:37,400
Are you excited?

424
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Wow! It's scary.

425
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,010
It's dirty.

426
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,710
It's dirty.

427
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,650


428
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,250
You don't want to go to bed?

429
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,110
Do you still want to go to bed?

430
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,020
No, I don't want to go to bed.

431
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,570
Give me a break.

432
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,230
I know.

433
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,090
You'll get tired if you do it three times.

434
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
Do you feel better
now? It was so warm.

435
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,110


436
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,810
I'm sweating a little.

437
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:18,190
It's been a while since I've been to
a hot spring, so I'm getting excited.

438
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
I've been in too much.

439
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,810
It's been a while since I've been to
a hot spring, so I'm getting excited.

440
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:25,811
I know.

441
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,910
I'm always in a hurry.

442
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,010
I feel like I'm on vacation.

443
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:33,651
I feel like I was able to take a picture.

444
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,150
The last one was not good.

445
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,160
I shouldn't have done that.

446
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,450
The hot spring was...

447
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,330
But it felt good.

448
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,160
I'm back.

449
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Welcome back.

450
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
What's up?

451
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,260
Were you taking a bath alone?

452
00:33:05,261 --> 00:33:08,300
I was in the bath. It was fun.

453
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,020
You have something in your ear.

454
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh, really?
I thought there was some water in my ear.

455
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Oh, really? That's terrible.

456
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
What is it?

457
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,550
What? Wait, wait.

458
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,340
Oh, no.

459
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,360


460
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
What?

461
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
What?

462
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,800
Yes.

463
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
What? Please relax.

464
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Oh, no.

465
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Oh, my.

466
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780


467
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,960
Is your ear weak?

468
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,700
Oh.

469
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,120
You look like you feel good.

470
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,360
Oh, no.

471
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
I don't mean that.

472
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, you're right.

473
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
It's a little wet.

474
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Oh.

475
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,320
Oh, a little.

476
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
What's the matter? Nothing.

477
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,040


478
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,580
Are you out of breath? A little.

479
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,770


480
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,240
Do you feel better? Thank you.

481
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500


482
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,660
I want to do something.

483
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Me too.

484
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,840
Please come here.

485
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,820
I'm going to put on make-up.

486
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm going to moisturize your face.

487
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,090
I don't do that.

488
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,080
You have to moisturize your face.

489
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,220
I don't do that.

490
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,920
Thank you.

491
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,140
How is it? Is it getting moist?

492
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,800
I'm going to put some lotion on you.

493
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
What's wrong? Nothing.

494
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900


495
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,240
You look so comfortable.

496
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Thank you.

497
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,640
I feel bad that you have to do this for me.

498
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,660
Do you want to moisturize your hands?

499
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:37,741
Do you want to have
a bath? It's important.

500
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,530


501
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,040
Do you want to have
a bath? It's okay.

502
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,560


503
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,780
Please put your hand out.

504
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,320
It's good for you.

505
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,080
Do you want to have a bath?

506
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,120
Do you want to have a bath?

507
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,000
Do you want to have a bath?

508
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,001
I'll give you a bath.

509
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,460
Your hands are dry.

510
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,640
Your hands are dry.

511
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,091
I have to put you to sleep.

512
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,660
I'm fine.

513
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,630
Do you feel good? I'm happy.

514
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,500
Hey, boss.

515
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,880


516
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,641
Have you been staring at their boobs?

517
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,000
That's not fair.

518
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,240
Look at mine.

519
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:31,241
Please look at my boobs.

520
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,020
Why did you look at my boobs?

521
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,180
Please look at my boobs, too.

522
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,440
Did you look at my boobs that much?

523
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,301
You like my boobs, don't you?

524
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:57,900
You always look at my boobs.

525
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,140
Please touch me.

526
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,340
Hatsune, please lick me a lot.

527
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,400
Do you like my licking?

528
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,401
Do you like it?

529
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,640
She is licking her belly.

530
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,240
Let's lick her belly.

531
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,480
Are you happy?

532
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,100
You are licking your belly very much.

533
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,100
You are so cute.

534
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,500
Please lick your belly, too.

535
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
What?

536
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,960
She is licking her belly.

537
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
She is licking her belly.

538
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,500
You look like you're in a good mood.

539
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I feel good.

540
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,460
What about me? Please lick me.

541
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,420


542
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,380
This is how you do it.

543
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,340
You're using your tongue very well.

544
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,400
It feels good, doesn't it?

545
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,291
Do you like the sound of my mouth?

546
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,460
I want you to lick this side, too.

547
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:53,461
What? I'm wet, too.

548
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,460
I'm wet, too.

549
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,220
Wait a minute.

550
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,360
I'm wet, too.

551
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,460


552
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,620
What is it?

553
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,220
Please turn around.

554
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,240
Are you sleepy?

555
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:04,720
I'm so sorry to hear that.

556
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:05,500
She is a little bit scared.

557
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:05,520
I'm so sorry.

558
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:06,521
You can't see
her, right? I can't.

559
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,880
You have to ask her directly.

560
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,020
I'll go to ask her directly.

561
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,140
I'll ask her directly.

562
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:22,020
I'll ask her directly.

563
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:35,140
Mom, I want you to turn around a little.

564
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Where is it? Here.

565
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,260


566
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,220
Kuu-chan, how are you doing?

567
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,420
Are you sleeping well?

568
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,540
It's so hard just to lick it, isn't it?

569
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,041
Chai-chan, you are eating a lot of katsuo.

570
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,500
I want to eat more katsuo.

571
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,240
I want to eat more katsuo.

572
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,280
You like katsuo, don't you?

573
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,620
I want to eat more katsuo.

574
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
What?

575
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,620
What is it?

576
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,220
Do you like my butt?

577
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,640
Who likes your
butt? I can't choose.

578
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,840


579
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,140
Please touch it.

580
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Touch it?

581
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,460
You don't know if you don't touch it.

582
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:19,800
You don't like it, do you?

583
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,660
I don't like it.

584
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:44,710
Let's watch it together.

585
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,890
I want to touch it.

586
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,960
Here?

587
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,710
I don't like it.

588
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:26,030
I don't like it.

589
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,510
I don't like it.

590
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:36,750
This is the best vacation ever.

591
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,620
You miss me too, don't you?

592
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,900
Can I pet you here? I'm sorry.

593
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
I'm out of strength.

594
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,280
Are you out of strength?

595
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,320
You are really cute.

596
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,530
What's wrong with you?

597
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,980
Do you feel good?

598
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,260
How are you doing?

599
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,740
How is your condition?

600
00:47:40,705 --> 00:47:42,640
Is it getting worse?

601
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:45,920
You've been hit all the time.

602
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,520
I want to see it.

603
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,810
Are you embarrassed?
No, I'm not.

604
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,650


605
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,810
What are you going
to do if you hide it now?

606
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,250
What are you going to do?

607
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,690
Do you like such a cute butterfly?

608
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,700
Wow, it's so warm.

609
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:18,040
Tickle tickle

610
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,290
Is the temperature going to rise?

611
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,291
What is it?

612
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,810
Kacchan also licks it.

613
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:53,820
You can't bear it, can you?

614
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,220
It's the same for us.

615
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:09,561
It's a little... Is it no good?

616
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,140
What is it?

617
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,160
It's already rubbed.

618
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,800
Do you want some water?

619
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,730
If you put it in later...

620
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,300
Let's eat.

621
00:50:54,295 --> 00:51:12,250
You put it in my bowl.

622
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,530
I have to tell you now.

623
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,390
Are you OK?

624
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:26,770
This is not good.

625
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:28,150
It's not good.

626
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,810
But you don't resist at all.

627
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,730
Our daily exercise is over.

628
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:38,731
You can move.

629
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:49,300
You can move, can't you?

630
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:32,650
This is not good.

631
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,270
What is not good?

632
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,700
Nothing is not good.

633
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,680
My neck is going to be cut off.

634
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,480
My...

635
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,440
Hey, Kacchan.

636
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,880
It's my turn next.

637
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,820
Kacchan, I told you many times.

638
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,881
Let's get along with each other.

639
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,360
So,

640
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
let's get along.

641
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
I have to take a bath.

642
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,600
I haven't taken a bath yet.

643
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,520
But it felt so good,
didn't it? It's so warm.

644
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,220


645
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,440
It's like a butterfly's nest.

646
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,060
It's so warm.

647
00:54:37,095 --> 00:54:39,760
My hands got in.

648
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:44,560
Look at him. He's so cute.

649
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,020
He's become stiff again.

650
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,260
Please touch him.

651
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,261
I'm sorry.

652
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,260
I'm sorry.

653
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Look at this.

654
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:26,850
I'm sorry.

655
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,710
I'm sorry.

656
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:38,820
I'm sorry.

657
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,140
I'm sorry.

658
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,990
I'm sorry.

659
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,210
Oh, no!

660
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,410
Don't do that!

661
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:44,550
I don't want to let it go.

662
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,750
It's going to go in again.

663
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,130
It went in!

664
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,370
I can see inside of your body.

665
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:04,430
You want to have a bath, don't you?

666
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,280
You want to have a bath, don't you?

667
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:55,560
You are so happy.

668
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,580
Let me see your face.

669
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:55,830
Let me put you in the bath.

670
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:56,991
Can you put it in your mouth?

671
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:11,680
Does it feel good?

672
00:59:13,280 --> 01:00:17,340
Can I have some too?

673
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,740
It's good, isn't it?

674
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,300
I've only had a little bit.

675
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,760
It's Mei-chan's turn.

676
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:52,140
Let's have a toast.

677
01:00:52,141 --> 01:01:02,280
You were so good at having
sex, weren't you? No, I wasn't.

678
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:03,281


679
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,020
You were so cute.

680
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,360
You were big and hard.

681
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,540
You were the best.

682
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,140
I love you.

683
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,660
I love you.

684
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,200
I love you, too.

685
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:23,540
I like you, too.

686
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,340
I like you the most.

687
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:50,030
You are so manly.

688
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,310
You are so cool.

689
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,170
You are a sweet potato.

690
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,420
You are a sweet potato.

691
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,460
Give me some power.

692
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,360
You are so red.

693
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,340
You are getting smaller and smaller.

694
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,380
You are getting smaller and smaller.

695
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:47,730
I can't do it anymore.

696
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,440
What's wrong?

697
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,520
You are sweating a lot.

698
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,240
It feels good.

699
01:03:34,115 --> 01:03:35,396
You still have a long way to go.

700
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,380
Let me see.

701
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:41,381
I'm going to sleep.

702
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,340
It's so sour.

703
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,220
I feel ticklish.

704
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,540
I'm still taking a nap.

705
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,240
It's just right.

706
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,760
I want to take a nap.

707
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:12,400
I'm still going to take a nap.

708
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:13,401
I think I'm going to cry.

709
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,060
I'm a romanticist.

710
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,440
I'm a romanticist.

711
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,080
I'm a romanticist.

712
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:21,260
I'm a romanticist.

713
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:21,820
I'm a romanticist.

714
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:22,300
I'm a romanticist.

715
01:04:22,301 --> 01:04:23,600
I'm a romanticist.

716
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,140
I'm a romanticist.

717
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,920
I'm a romanticist.

718
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,840
I'm a romanticist.

719
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,880
I'm a romanticist.

720
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,440
I'm a romanticist.

721
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,540
I'm a romanticist.

722
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,560
I'm a romanticist.

723
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,040
I'm a romanticist.

724
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,100
I'm a romanticist.

725
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,280
I will put it on you.

726
01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:02,015
You have a long neck.

727
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,980
I will give you a crampon.

728
01:05:03,981 --> 01:05:05,260
A crampon is painful.

729
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,000
No, I don't think so.

730
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,480
Because it is hard here.

731
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,560
There is a crampon.

732
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,460
It's almost done.

733
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,480
It's almost done.

734
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,580
Oh, wait.

735
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:19,120
Oh, great.

736
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,240
It's round.

737
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,580
I can't do it.

738
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,650
Oh, wait.

739
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:17,980
It's done.

740
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,320
What? No, no, no.

741
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,660
I can't see anything.

742
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,440
Did you light the
fire? No, I didn't.

743
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
I'm sorry.

744
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,780
Don't do that.

745
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:39,750
Let go of me.

746
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,620


747
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,000
You made me cry, too.

748
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:26,900
You cried.

749
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,920
I'm so happy.

750
01:08:05,405 --> 01:08:08,820
Hey, Kacchou.

751
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,300
Do you have something to say?

752
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:13,800
Why?

753
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,840
I thought I was next.

754
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,440
It's OK.

755
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,540
I'm not alone.

756
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:29,580
The chief said that you are alone.

757
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,300
No, I'm not.

758
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:34,440
Amelie is still being pushed.

759
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,400
Chief, you are all friends.

760
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,590
You are all friends.

761
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:54,060
Chief, you feel good, don't you?

762
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,560
Chief, your waist moved.

763
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,400
Wow, it's moving!

764
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,420
It's moving! It's twitching.

765
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:10,421


766
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,420
What's wrong? Do you want to get out?

767
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,620
Let's move!

768
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,380
It's intense!

769
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,230
It feels good!

770
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:14,240
Kachou, you want to feel
better, don't you? Yes, I do.

771
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:30,340
You are too energetic.

772
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,710
I'm getting bigger and bigger.

773
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:45,650
How about your muscles?

774
01:10:45,651 --> 01:10:46,651
What's wrong with
you? Hey, boss.

775
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:51,830
I'm sleepy.

776
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,960


777
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,100
I'm going to go to bed.

778
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,360
You're amazing, boss.

779
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:42,140
What?

780
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,800
You're the best, boss.

781
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:44,800
Wait a minute.

782
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,880
You're amazing.

783
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:52,000
You're the best, boss.

784
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,300
You're the best, boss.

785
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,060
I love bonito.

786
01:12:04,175 --> 01:12:07,420
I love bonito, too.

787
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:10,220
I love bonito, too.

788
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:13,160
Let's have more and more fun trip.

789
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:21,930
Wow! Let's eat.

790
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,500
Thank you for the meal.

791
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,820
Thank you for the meal.

792
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,150
It was a good reputation.

793
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,630
That's right.

794
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,650
That's right.

795
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:39,410
Captain,

796
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,490
This was delicious.

797
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,590
That's right.

798
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,570
Look at this.

799
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,190
It's OK.

800
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,330
Look at this.

801
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,070
It was delicious.

802
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:51,071
It was good,
wasn't it? It's good.

803
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,670


804
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,830
Is it good? Thank you.

805
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:02,810


806
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,870
This is good, too.

807
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,860
It's good.

808
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,940
Are you all right? Thank you.

809
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,040


810
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,900
Is this good, too?

811
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,980
Let's eat together.

812
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:34,500
Oh, you kissed me.

813
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:39,320
I thought so, but all three
of us only ate the green one.

814
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,480
That's true.

815
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,580
I'll give you a sweet one.

816
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,500
Is it good? Eat a lot.

817
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,960


818
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,740
You are hesitating, aren't you?

819
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,840
No, no, I'm fine.

820
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:05,700
How about a drink?

821
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,360
No, no, I'm fine.

822
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,780
I'm fine.

823
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
I'm totally fine.

824
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,380
I'm totally fine.

825
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,080
Then, I'll have you spill a lot.

826
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:27,081
Are you okay? No, I'm fine.

827
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:31,520
I'm fine.

828
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,120
It's painful.

829
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:41,520
I'll do it.

830
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,420
I'm fine.

831
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,700
I'm fine.

832
01:14:44,701 --> 01:14:45,701


833
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:01,140
You're drinking too much.

834
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,180
You're drinking too much.

835
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,580
I'm fine.

836
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,180
Oh, no.

837
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:21,420
No, no, no, no.

838
01:15:21,421 --> 01:15:22,600
Oh, no.

839
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,601
I'm a man.

840
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,940
I don't want to practice hunting.

841
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,200
I don't want to practice hunting.

842
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,600
I don't want to practice hunting.

843
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,520
I'll do it.

844
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,240
Please, don't.

845
01:15:41,241 --> 01:15:42,360
Please, don't.

846
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:46,840
I can't drink it all.

847
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:50,140
You have to drink it all.

848
01:15:52,155 --> 01:15:54,540
Oh, it's so bitter.

849
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,360
You have to drink it all.

850
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,920
I'm sorry.

851
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,820
I can't drink it all.

852
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:09,200
Don't lick it.

853
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,500
Don't lick it.

854
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,420
You don't have to lick it.

855
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,300
What is this?

856
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,120
Why did you take
it? I got a cold.

857
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:26,121
I have a cold.

858
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,780


859
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,100
What are you
doing? It's slippery.

860
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:45,800


861
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,680
I'm going to catch a cold.

862
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,180
I've grown wet.

863
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,140
Well...

864
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,660
You're wet.

865
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,560
Hey, girls...

866
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,720
You must be hungry.

867
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,480
Are you ok? No, I'm not.

868
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,520
I'm hungry.

869
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,200


870
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:35,100
I'm getting sleepy.

871
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:47,900
I can't.

872
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,380
Oh, no!

873
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,420
I said, no!

874
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:55,421
Why?

875
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,040
Kuu-chan, look at this.

876
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,260
I took it.

877
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,940
No, no! I'll do it.

878
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,740


879
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,640
Oh, no!

880
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,080
You've never been licked
because you're hungry?

881
01:18:14,081 --> 01:18:15,281
Don't you have anything to do?

882
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:16,700
No, I don't have anything to do.

883
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,440
Me too.

884
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,840
I want to lick the president's ring finger.

885
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,760
No, I don't.

886
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,520
You made it shiny.

887
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:36,900
What is it?

888
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,860
I want to lick the president's ring finger.

889
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:22,980
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby cry like this.

890
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,180
I'm so happy.

891
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,560
I'm so happy.

892
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,460
I'm so happy.

893
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,080
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

894
01:19:43,081 --> 01:19:43,300
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

895
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,140
Please show me your face.

896
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,480
No, I want to see your whole body.

897
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:50,900
I can't touch your face.

898
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,440
What are you talking
about? Why? I'm sorry.

899
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,040
I'm sorry.

900
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:58,460
I'm sorry.

901
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,600
I'm sorry.

902
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:04,940


903
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,310


904
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:36,520
It's been a long time since I've had a
baby, but I'm so happy to have a baby.

905
01:20:36,521 --> 01:20:39,780
I'm so happy to have a baby,
but I'm so happy to have a baby.

906
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:51,050
Oh, my God!

907
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,350
Oh, my God!

908
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,850
Oh, my God!

909
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,460
Oh, it's intense.

910
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:32,260
I want to drink a cup of tea, too.

911
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,070
Oh, I'm dizzy.

912
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,490
Oh, it's great.

913
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,110
It's so soft.

914
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:59,230
You've grown up again, haven't you?

915
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,850
Is this your first meal?

916
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,150
I want to have a hamburger steak.

917
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:13,151
Do you want to eat?

918
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:23,350
You can eat in this state,
can't you? Good boy.

919
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:30,950


920
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,920
※Please be careful not to hurt the baby.

921
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:55,950
It's coming out.

922
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,300
No, no, no!

923
01:23:05,301 --> 01:23:06,600
It's coming out.

924
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,560
It's coming out.

925
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:32,170
Get it out.

926
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,720
I'm sorry.

927
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,060
The president who is patient is cute.

928
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,460
Do you want to drink cacao?

929
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:07,440
I want to drink with three people,
so please buy me a cup of coffee.

930
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,420
Mocchan, you're sweating a lot.

931
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,240
Mocchan, you're starting
to smell like sweat.

932
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,241
I'm back.

933
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:53,420
I love the smell of the butterfly.

934
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,100
I love the smell of the butterfly.

935
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:04,170
This is the first time
I've ever had a baby, so

936
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,700
I'm a little nervous, but
I'm going to do my best.

937
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,680
I'm going to do my best.

938
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,020
I'm going to do my best.

939
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:14,740
I'm going to do my best.

940
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:15,741
I'm going to do my best.

941
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,290
I'm going to do my best.

942
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:26,210
I'm going to do my best.

943
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,310
I'm going to do my best.

944
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:32,390
I'm going to do my best.

945
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:58,140
It's hard, isn't it?

946
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:17,520
It's short, isn't it?

947
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:51,320
Oh, my voice is coming out.

948
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,520
Are you all right?
I'm so sleepy.

949
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,100


950
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:14,100
I can't do it anymore.

951
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,050
I'm so sleepy.

952
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,500
Did you sleep well?

953
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:24,501
Is that so?

954
01:27:28,495 --> 01:27:29,920
Kacchou, you are sleeping well.

955
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,720
I'm tired.

956
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,820
Are you nervous?

957
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,080
Your hair is messy.

958
01:27:53,475 --> 01:27:58,000
Good night, Kacchou.

959
01:27:58,001 --> 01:27:59,001
Wait!

960
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:01,880
Good morning, Kacchou.

961
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:03,780
Good morning!

962
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:06,180
It's not morning yet, it's night.

963
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,460
Hey, what?

964
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:12,480
We were so sleepy and
we couldn't sleep at all.

965
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,100
That's right.

966
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,420
It's only a little bit until morning.

967
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:18,930
Let's do something fun.

968
01:28:22,195 --> 01:28:28,140
The butterfly is making
us dizzy, so don't move.

969
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:29,141
I'm sorry.

970
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,060
You're so cute.

971
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:33,080
Are you looking forward
to it? Hey, I'm here.

972
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:34,760
I'm here.

973
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,540
I'm here.

974
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:39,300
I'm here.

975
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:40,640
I'm here.

976
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,960


977
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,240
Omaha baby is crying.

978
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,040
The baby is crying because he is angry.

979
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,110
Oh, it's hot.

980
01:30:55,050 --> 01:31:07,110
It doesn't feel good.

981
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:09,470
It feels good.

982
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:13,630
I'm going to sleep.

983
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,220
I'm going to sleep.

984
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,960
What's wrong? Let's eat.

985
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:31,370
Oh, no.

986
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,280
I'm hungry.

987
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:39,760
I'm hungry.

988
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,000
I'm hungry.

989
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,140
It's hard.

990
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,240


991
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,080
I'll show you my back.

992
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:20,960
I'm tired.

993
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,020
I'm tired.

994
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,800
I'm tired.

995
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,100
What's wrong with you?

996
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:57,360
What's wrong with you?

997
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,120
What's wrong with you?

998
01:34:00,121 --> 01:34:00,280
What's wrong with you?

999
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:00,640
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

1000
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:01,700
Are you going to wake up?

1001
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:02,680
What? I don't know.

1002
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,200


1003
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:19,660
Wow!

1004
01:34:19,661 --> 01:34:20,661
Wow!

1005
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:59,720
I can't stop crying.

1006
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,700
I'm going to sleep.

1007
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:12,580
I'm going to sleep.

1008
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:20,380
I'm going to sleep.

1009
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,740
It's normal now.

1010
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,920
Wait a minute.

1011
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,240
Wait a minute.

1012
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,380
What's going on? Wait a minute.

1013
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,000
It's normal now.

1014
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:45,080
It's normal now.

1015
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,620
It's okay.

1016
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,700
I can't do it.

1017
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,280
I can't do it.

1018
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:18,040
I can't do it.

1019
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:29,980
Kacchan, I want you to sleep.

1020
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:44,300
You are sleepy, aren't you?

1021
01:36:44,301 --> 01:36:48,980
You are sleepy, aren't you?

1022
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,440
You are moving again, aren't you?

1023
01:36:53,600 --> 01:38:31,320
You are sleepy, aren't you?

1024
01:38:31,321 --> 01:38:33,220
My friend, I miss you.

1025
01:38:33,221 --> 01:38:38,620
I miss you.

1026
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,260
I miss you.

1027
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,460
I miss you.

1028
01:38:46,461 --> 01:38:47,500
Oh, it's cold.

1029
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:54,560
Oh, it's cold.

1030
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:59,940


1031
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:12,690
I can't stand it anymore.

1032
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:32,270
Show me your butt.

1033
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:42,640
How far can you reach?

1034
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:06,830
I'm going to cry.

1035
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,170
I'm going to cry.

1036
01:40:53,360 --> 01:43:16,360
I'm going to cry.

1037
01:43:16,361 --> 01:43:46,220
I'm sorry.

1038
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:48,820
I'm sorry.

1039
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,080
I'm sorry.

1040
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:38,120
I'm sorry.

1041
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:12,450
She is a baby of the first age.

1042
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:19,710
She was born in the year of the bear.

1043
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:29,830
She is a baby of the second age.

1044
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:53,330
She was born in the year of the bear.

1045
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:18,760
Mom, don't do that. I'll stop you.

1046
01:48:41,775 --> 01:48:44,360
Wait, wait, wait.

1047
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,660
Don't pull me.

1048
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:48,600
I'm scared.

1049
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:12,380
I'm shivering.

1050
01:51:12,381 --> 01:51:13,820
Let me help, to your back.

1051
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,960
It feels so good!

1052
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,340
Oh my gosh!

1053
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:14,960
No, no, no!

1054
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:19,040
No, no!

1055
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:28,600
Oh my gosh!

1056
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,700
The baby is crying.

1057
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:43,300
I want to go out.

1058
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:48,180
No, you can't.

1059
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:49,640
I want to go out.

1060
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:51,200
I want to go out.

1061
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,920
Ah!

1062
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:14,920
Ah!

1063
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:19,040
Hello!

1064
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:20,720

1065
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:21,960
Ah!

1066
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:25,670

01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,220
Hello!

1070
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:32,870
Ah!

1071
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,520
Um!

1072
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,920
Um!

1073
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,660
Ah!

1074
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:38,840
It's the best!

1075
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:40,630
Um!

1076
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:42,360
Ah! Ah! It's hot.

1077
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,840
It's hot.

1078
01:54:45,570 --> 01:54:47,730
It's hot.

1079
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:53,350


1080
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:59,031
It's 5 o'clock, isn't it?

1081
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:02,890
It's 3 o'clock, isn't it?

1082
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:06,170
It's 3 o'clock,
isn't it? It's hot.

1083

01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:48,390
It's so hard.

1098
01:56:48,391 --> 01:56:49,790


1099
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:11,040
Let's get out of here.

1100
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:12,041
Are you OK?

1101
01:57:50,150 --> 01:58:07,970
I'm going to make a baby.

1102
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:11,010
I'm going to make a baby.

1103
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:11,830
I'm going to make a baby.

1104
01:58:11,831 --> 01:58:13,550
Chief, please give me a baby.

1105
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:20,130
Chief, please give me a baby.

1106
01:58:20,131 --> 01:58:22,810
You are the most energetic, aren't you?

1107
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:27,370
Let's take a bath.

1108
01:58:27,371 --> 01:58:29,370
Let's go home.

1109
01:58:40,910 --> 01:58:43,090
You've been crying all the time.

1110
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:46,630
You've been crying all the time.

1111
01:58:50,845 --> 01:58:57,850
Let's go to bed.

1112

It's hot.

1119
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:41,550
Ah!

1120
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,840

Ah!

1126
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:07,220
Thanks to the chief,

1127
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:12,220
it was a really fun autograph session.

1128
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,340
The chief was really cute.

1129
02:01:17,015 --> 02:01:19,960
Let's go to the 4th
anniversary concert again.

1130
02:01:20,870 --> 02:01:21,980
Fufu.

1131
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:23,320
Fufu.

1132
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,400
