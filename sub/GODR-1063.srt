Would you like to try your hand at it?

82

Mr. Kanaka's wife.

00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,280
My room is hot.

136
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,050
I bit your hair.

137
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,580
Good night.

Good night.

141
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:07,430
What is wrong? Your hands are shaking.

142
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,650
I am nervous.

143
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,410
I am nervous.

144
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:21,480
This is really wonderful.

145
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I hope you like it.

146
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,290
How is it?

It is really wonderful.

148
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,890
Me too.

149
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,510
It is embarrassing.

150
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,970
Do you feel good?

151
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,690
Yes.

152
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,070

You have a nice boob.

156
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,740
Your nipples are...

157
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,040
I am sensitive.

158
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,620
It is embarrassing.

159
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
I don't want to say that.

160
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
You are a little girl.

161
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Do not do that.

162
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,720
You are a little girl.

163
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:33,040
It is rare.

164
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,620
It is rare.

165
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,580
I really do not like women who are angry.

166
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,330
I am sorry.

167
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,530
I am sorry.

168
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,050
I am so hungry.

169
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,240
I am hungry, too.

170
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:15,900
I am going to sleep now.

171

I am going to sleep now.

174
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,460
I am so tired.

175
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,820
You have to get used to it.

176
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,500
I am used to it.

177
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
No, no, no.

178
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,140
It is not a big deal.

179
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Thank you.

180
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,100
You are wearing short pants again.

181
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,440
It is wonderful.

182
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,660
Really?

183
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
Are you sure?

184
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Are you sure?

185
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,100
I will open it for you.

186
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,990
Thank you very much.

187
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,140
You are welcome.

188
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,040
Do you want me to
open it for you? Yes, please.

189
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,040


190
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:23,030
How is it? It is wonderful.

191
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,730
I feel it.

192
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:26,950


193
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,490
I really feel it.

194
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,750
I love you.

195
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,440
I love you, too.

196
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
I am sorry.

197
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,680
I love you, too.

198
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,880
I love you, too.

199
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,820
I love you, too.

200
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,160
I love you, too.

201
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:56,460
I love you, too.

202
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:19,020
It is amazing, isn't it?

203
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,280
It is amazing, isn't it?

204
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,220
It is amazing, isn't it?

205
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,360
It is amazing, isn't it?

206
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,440
It is amazing, isn't it?

207
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:27,641
I feel like I am going to puke.

208
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,300
You are going to feel better.

209
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,950
I am going to puke, but I am going to puke.

210
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,980
I am going to puke, but I am going to puke.

211
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:48,420
I am going to puke, but I am going to puke.

212
00:48:48,421 --> 00:49:14,150
I am going to puke, but I am going to puke.

213
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:27,520
I am going to puke, but I am going to puke.

214
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,700
Children have a lot of fun as they grow up.

215
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:42,421
Children are happy to be with their mother.

216
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:06,100
There is a
way to have fun, but it is not so easy.

217
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:11,360
Children are not very good at playing
with their mothers.

218
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,300
Do you feel good? I feel good.

219
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,860
..

220
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,600
It is warm!

221
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,060
What is wrong? I got a cold.

222
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400


223
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,440
It is still warm.

224
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:11,080
It is still warm.

225
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:12,540
It is nice here,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

226
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,560
I am so happy.

227
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,350


228
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,940
It is wonderful here.

229
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,200
Oh, you are so positive.

230
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,880
I was taught by my mother.

231
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,200
I see.

232
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:43,880
You are doing well.

233
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,040
It is hard, isn't it? Yes, it is.

234
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,420


235
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:24,580
This video is a derivative work of the
Tohoku Prefecture Tourism Promotion Agency.

236
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,760
The author of this video
is a former member of

237
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:27,520
the Tohoku
Prefecture Tourism Promotion Agency.

238
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,100
Are you OK?

239
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,340
You are good at this technique.

240
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,320
I didn't expect you to be so good at it.

241
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,020
How do you feel?

242
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,400
It's hard, isn't it?

243
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:39,401
It's hard, isn't it?

244
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,200
It's hard, isn't it?

245
00:52:42,915 --> 00:52:44,020
I will do it again.

246
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Oh, no!

247
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,100
I will do it, too.

248
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:50,480
OK.

249
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:51,481
I will do it, too.

250
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,500
Let's see what we can do.

251
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,620
Oh, no!

252
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,150
This video is
a new way to get used to the new baby.

253
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:46,370
But I am still not used to it.

254
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:47,770
I am still not used to it.

255
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,550
But I am getting used to it.

256
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:35,690
I love you.

257
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,430
I love you.

258
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,990
I love you.

259
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,100
I feel like
my love is deepened when I do this.

260
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,060
I always feel something fresh.

261
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,320
I didn't do this.

262
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:29,321
You are doing your best.

263
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,280
I can't stand it anymore.

264
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,960
I will change my clothes again.

265
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,820
See you later.

266
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,710
I can't stand it anymore.

267
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:25,010
It is hard to imagine how much of
a crybaby I was when I was a kid.

268
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,680
I was a bit of a crybaby when I was a kid.

269
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:49,620
But I was a bit of a
crybaby when I grew up.

270
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,200
I was a bit of a crybaby when I grew up.

271
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,370
I was a bit of a crybaby when I grew up.

272
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:03,566
It is a shame, but it's
not that I am not a crybaby.

273
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,650
Oh, it feels good.

274
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,810
Wow, it is great.

275
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:09,490
You can lie down here.

276
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,290
Look, look.

277
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,130
You are enjoying it.

278
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

279
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,230
It feels good, doesn't it?

280
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:26,690
Oh, it feels good.

281
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,580
It is the first time for
you to lie down on my lap.

282
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:55,581
It is the first time for
you to lie down on my lap.

283
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,820
Well, it doesn't matter.

284
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:57,981
I am not sure if I can say it.

285
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,080
Do not worry about it.

286
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,310
You look so fat.

287
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,110
I am so happy.

288
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:21,190
I feel so good.

289
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,440
Are you going to bed early today?

290
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,940
Yes.

291
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,580
What is this? It is a pillow.

292
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,950


293
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,040
A pillow?

294
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,100
Yes.

295
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,660
This feels good.

296
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,540
Really?

297
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
Yes.

298
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:13,370
I want to talk to you.

299
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,030
I got it.

300
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,760
You are always like this.

301
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:31,500
Your technique is good.

302
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,440
You can do it by yourself.

303
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,500
I got it.

304
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,120
You are the best!

305
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,540
Do you feel good?

306
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,980
Yes, I do!

307
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:22,540
It is the same as always.

308
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,660
I feel good.

309
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,140
It is the same as always.

310
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,100
Please hold me tight.

311
01:00:46,450 --> 01:01:18,810
You seem to be in a good mood this year.

312
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,550
I am glad to hear that.

313
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,670
I was very excited and hungry this year.

314
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:29,630
I am glad to hear that.

315
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:30,631
I am glad to hear that.

316
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,170
I am happy.

317
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:58,950
I prepared a toy for you.

318
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,370
What is it? It is a toy.

319
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,650


320
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,010
A toy?

321
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,450
Have you ever
used it? No, I haven't.

322
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,130


323
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,290
You haven't?

324
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:07,930
No.

325
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:08,931
That is a shame.

326
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,050
I haven't.

327
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,010
It's
a rare opportunity, isn't it? Yes, it is.

328
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,010
It is a toy.

329
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:14,330
It is a toy.

330
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,870


331
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,330
Look, there's something like this.

332
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:25,130
This is the
one you always use, right? Yes, it is.

333
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,730


334
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,131
Can you show me how to use it?

335
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,410
Me? Yes, you first.

336
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:33,830


337
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,310
It is a little difficult, but...

338
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,560
I put it here...

339
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,550
and put it here...

340
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,850
I wonder if it fits.

341
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,370
Is it OK?

342
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,790
Are you all
right? Yes, I am fine.

343
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,070
Look at this.

344
01:02:58,690 --> 01:02:59,690


345
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,250
It's swollen, isn't it?

346
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,610
It is swollen,
Isn't it? Look at this.

347
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:04,611


348
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:06,430
It's swollen, isn't it?

349
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,550
It's swollen, isn't it?

350
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:10,990
It's swollen, isn't it?

351
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,670
I am glad I found you.

352
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:17,070
I am glad I found you.

353
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:18,670
I am glad I found you.

354
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:26,910
If you haven't done anything yet, you
can do it like this at first.

355
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,970
Do you know how to use a router?

356
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,790
I do not know how to use a router.

357
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,770
Then, I will show you how to use it.

358
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,910
Have you ever used
a router? No, I haven't.

359
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,090


360
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,490
I don't think so.

361
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,331
This is the first time
I have seen such a thing.

362
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,520
It feels good.

363
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,090
The sound is amazing.

364
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:17,290
The sound is amazing, too.

365
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,230
It feels good.

366
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,770
Wow, it is amazing.

367
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:28,110
It is a great feeling,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

368
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,150


369
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,770
Does it feel good?

370
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,590
Yes.

371
01:04:47,080 --> 01:05:00,980
Is it just hitting?

372
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,400
No, it is not just hitting.

373
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:05,980
Really?

374
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,280
Yes.

375
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,260
Please spread
your legs and put your hands inside.

376
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,960
Oh, you put your hands inside.

377
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,300
How do you feel?

378
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,180
Your hands are shaking.

379
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,980
Yes, they are.

380
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,780
Are you OK? Yes, I am fine.

381
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,120


382
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,290
I am going to put my hands inside.

383
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:32,931
It is OK because your hands are connected.

384
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:35,470
Put your hands inside.

385
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:36,430
Yes, put your hands inside.

386
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:37,711
I am going to give you a massage.

387
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,770
I am going to massage you.

388
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:43,850
I am going to massage you.

389
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:44,310
It feels good.

390
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:45,311
Does it feel good?

391
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,910
I feel a little strange.

392
01:05:55,100 --> 01:06:01,050
It feels good.

393
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,646
You have been doing a lot of massage lately.

394
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,670
Yes.

395
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:29,260
This is the first time
I have ever seen a baby cry.

396
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:29,880
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

397
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:32,220
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

398
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,581
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

399
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:40,090
I was surprised to see a baby cry.

400
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:41,091
I am sorry.

401
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,310
What? I am sorry.

402
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:43,510


403
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,100
Ouch!

404
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,370
Ouch!

405
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,250
Ouch!

406
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,870
I am going to fall.

407
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,270
I am sorry.

408
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:23,870
It is okay.

409
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,610
You should practice this side.

410
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:03,710
This side? Okay.

411
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,030


412
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,110
Yoshikawa-san, how do you feel?

413
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,610
I am a little nervous.

414
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,450
You are a little advanced.

415
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,870
I am fine. I can do it slowly.

416
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,770
I feel good.

417
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,800
I am a little scared.

418
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,370
I am used to it.

419
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,510
It is amazing that you can do it so well.

420
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,790
Let's do it.

421
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:07,120
This video is a derivative work of the
Tohoku Prefecture Tourism Promotion Agency.

422
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,480
Please enjoy it with your eyes only.

423
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:37,860
I am glad I was able to reconnect with her.

424
01:09:37,861 --> 01:09:38,240
I feel so happy.

425
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,661
I am glad I got along with her.

426
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,120
I am glad I got along with her.

427
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:00,260
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying like this.

428
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:04,560
I am going to
take a picture of the baby's face of her.

429
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,500
I am going to take
a picture of the baby's face.

430
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,520
I am going to take
a picture of the baby's face.

431
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,030
He is playing with me.

432
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,070
It is amazing.

433
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,330
He is doing it.

434
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,230
He is playing to me.

435
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:52,750
Does it feel good?

436
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:56,470
Is it good?

437
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:58,830
He is playing with me.

438
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,210
Is it good? It is amazing.

439
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,650


440
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:05,750
What?

441
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,930
Do you feel good?

442
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,430
I can play alone.

443
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:10,870
It is amazing.

444
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:43,470
This is the first time
I have seen a baby in a baby carrier.

445
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,030
I am so happy.

446
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:46,031
You look sick.

447
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,670
You look sick.

448
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,790
You look like a mischievous girl.

449
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:21,460
Wait a minute.

450
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:41,570
I will give you a hug.

451
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:49,020
Do you want to go home?

452
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,780
My wife is tired.

453
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,220
I can't do this.

454
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,020
Do you feel good?

455
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,800
You have
never used it, have you? No, I haven't.

456
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,040


457
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,120
Are you not used to it?

458
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,000
I have to get help.

459
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,380
I will do it later.

460
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,500
I will help you while you put it in.

461
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,980
While I put it in?

462
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,680
Yes, while I put it in.

463
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:43,380
I am going to
do a massage with a special machine.

464
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:13,120
I am going to massage the back of my neck.

465
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:14,761
I am going to massage the back of my neck.

466
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,311
I am going to massage the back of my neck.

467
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:30,410
I see.

468
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,000
There are many ways to use it.

469
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,170
I see.

470
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,380
You want a real one,
do not you? Yes, I do.

471
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,940


472
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,360
It is too big now.

473
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,260
Let's put it here.

474
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,760
From the top.

475
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:31,120
It is a big one.

476
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,830
Look this way.

477
01:15:56,370 --> 01:16:03,660
-How do you feel? -Good.

478
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,980
This is the first
time I have ever seen a baby cry like this.

479
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:08,981
I am so happy.

480
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,700
How do you feel? I feel great.

481
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,110


482
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,320
I feel great, too.

483
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,076
Did you get a good
night's sleep? Yes, I did.

484
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,100


485
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,920
Do you feel good?

486
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,140
Yes, I feel great.

487
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,860
She is smiling.

488
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:34,360
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying like this.

489
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:37,780
I am sorry, too.

490
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,740
Thank you.

491
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,320
It feels good.

492
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:48,910
It feels good.

493
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:53,580
It feels good.

494
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,400
It feels good.

495
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:34,985
This is the first time I have ever seen a baby crying in front of me

496
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,100
I feel so good.

497
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:13,600
Do you feel good?

498
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:14,601
Yes, I feel good.

499
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,800
I will wipe your back.

500
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,320
I will wipe your back.

501
01:18:35,780 --> 01:19:01,330
Do you feel good?

502
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:02,650
Yes, I feel good.

503
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:10,700
I am sorry I am late.

504
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,460
I am sorry I am late.

505
01:19:15,165 --> 01:19:19,800
I am so tired.

506
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,240
Are you feeling good?

507
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,960
Do you want to lie down?

508
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,540
Do you want to lie down?

509
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,060
I am sorry for this.

510
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:22,390
So, you feel good? I feel good.

511
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,720
I like it.

512
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240


513
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:56,100
I will take off your hand.

514
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,320
Thank you.

515
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:06,160
Thank you.

516
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,220
The four of us are connected.

517
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,340
Great.

518
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:42,570
Do not cry, do not cry, do not cry.

519
01:21:52,345 --> 01:21:56,820
Are you comfortable?

520
01:21:58,605 --> 01:22:15,060
Oh, you are getting a lot of excitement.

521
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,100
Let's take a break.

522
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,840
Let's do it again.

523
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,480
Let's do it like this.

524
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,660
Let's do it normally.

525
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,440
You can go to bed now.

526
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:54,650
This is the first
time I have ever seen a baby cry like this.

527
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:55,950
I am sorry.

528
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:57,070
Did you feel it? Yes, I felt it.

529
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:58,350
I felt it.

530
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:20,990


531
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:22,390
Did you feel it? Yes, I did.

532
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:23,730
It hurts.

533
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:28,570
It hurts.

534
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,110


535
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:31,410
Oh, good boy!

536
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:32,770
Oh, good boy!

537
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:33,630
Oh, good boy!

538
01:23:33,631 --> 01:23:34,631
Oh, good boy!

539
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:36,090
Oh, good boy!

540
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:41,930
OK

541
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,090
Oh, you have already taken off the mask.

542
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:46,690
Oh, you have already taken off the mask.

543
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:49,930
OK

544
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,070
Is it OK? Perman.  I can't.

545
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:41,700
I can't.

546
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:55,980


547
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,320


548
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,100
Are you feeling better?

549
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:02,520
I feel much better.

550
01:25:02,521 --> 01:25:03,680
Yeah, like I am in the poop.

551
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,140
Now, can you move
more? Yes, like that.

552
01:25:06,141 --> 01:25:06,160
Like that.

553
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:07,161


554
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,360
Is it painful?

555
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:10,580
I feel like going to puke!

556
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:12,540
Oh, you feel anything?

557
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,120
Yeah, right now… You know,
I can feel like I am going to throw up!

558
01:25:15,121 --> 01:25:16,121
Oh my gosh!

559
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:18,880
Are you feeling good?

560
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:19,220
Yes, I am!

561
01:25:19,221 --> 01:25:20,560
Good job, keep going!

562
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,900
I am so glad to meet you.

563
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,500
Did you have
a good time? Yes, I did.

564
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:34,740
I feel so good.

565
01:25:34,741 --> 01:25:34,940


566
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,260
Are you full? Yes, I am.

567
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:37,820


568
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,460
Have you slept for
a long time? Yes, I did.

569
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,040


570
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,900
How did you feel? It was good.

571
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,320


572
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,500
You enjoyed
it, right? That is great.

573
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,841
I am glad to hear that.

574
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,560
Let's work together.

575
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:02,220
I'd like you to listen
to what I have to say.

576
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:06,280
What do you mean?

577
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,960
I'd like you to show me your clothes.

578
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,760
I see.

579
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,060
Can I? Excuse me.

580
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,460


581
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,020
Can
I take off my clothes? Wait a minute.

582
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:16,880
What? I am sorry.

583
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,300
Do not worry.

584
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,480


585
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,180
I am not talking about the question.

586
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:23,780
What? Well.

587
01:26:24,105 --> 01:26:25,060
..

588
01:26:25,061 --> 01:26:26,061
What? Wait a minute.

589
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,960
Don't look at me.

590
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,120
Wait a minute.

591
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:28,600
What?

592
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:28,980
What is the matter? Do not worry.

593
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:29,800


594
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,180
It is about the question.

595
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,720
Do not worry.

596
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,140
Wait a minute.

597
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:34,620
I am sorry.

598
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,180
Oh, today... I was off today.

599
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,440
Oh, I see.

600
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,260
I am sorry.

601
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:39,820
You are wearing a cute underwear.

602
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:40,840
Oh, I see.

603
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:41,840
Wait a minute.

604
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,060
Can I wear it today?

605
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:43,900
You can wear it today.

606
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,916
It is nice to have
this much free time, isn't it? Yes, it is.

607
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:46,940


608
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,300
If you do not mind, please take a look.

609
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,100
How do you like it?
It is beautiful.

610
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,540


611
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:55,360
Thank you very much.

612
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,840
You do not have to thank me.

613
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,740
It's beautiful, isn't it?

614
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,320
How do you like it?

615
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:05,320
It is very beautiful.

616
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,340
Thank you very much.

617
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:08,740
Thank you.

618
01:27:08,741 --> 01:27:09,280
I have a lot of things to tell you.

619
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,700
Oh, yes.

620
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,720
You do, do not you? Yes, I do.

621
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,160


622
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,240
I never listen to what my husband says.

623
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:20,751
What? You
do not listen to anything? No, I don't.

624
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,961
Can you show me more? Oh, yes.

625
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,120
What? Oh, yes.

626
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:24,620
Oh, yes.

627
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:25,300
Oh, yes.

628
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:25,340
Oh, yes.

629
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,480
Oh, yes.

630
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,040
Oh, yes.

631
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,380


632
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:39,840


633
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:45,511
Please take a good look at it.

634
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,120
Here you are.

635
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,560
Hey, what are you doing?

636
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:58,700
It's a little funny, isn't it?

637
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,171
I was a little surprised
because it was too big.

638
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,200
Do not hesitate to show me more.

639
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,780
Excuse me.

640
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:10,980
Are you serious?

641
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:17,970
It doesn't smell at all.

642
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,830
Can I take it off? Of course.

643
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:24,310


644
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,670
Let me see your beautiful breast.

645
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,430
Does it work?

646
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,630
How is it? It is beautiful.

647
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,630
Please look.

648
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:43,230


649
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:47,971
Please look at me carefully.

650
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,286
Do you hate this kind
of thing? No, I don't.

651
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:53,950
Oh, I see.

652
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:55,930


653
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,530
So, you like it.

654
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,090
Well, I don't know.

655
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:08,250
You like boobs,
do not you? Yes, I do.

656
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:09,670


657
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:11,910
It is not only boobs, is it?

658
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,290
It seems that you are looking down.

659
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,570
Could you show me your important part?

660
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,750
Yes.

661
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:26,590
It is a bit dangerous.

662
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,161
You are doing what you always do.

663
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,470
I am doing what I always do.

664
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,370
You are beautiful.

665
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,370
You are beautiful.

666
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,371
Yes, I am.

667
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,070
Actually...

668
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:41,690
Do you like this kind
of thing? Yes, I do.

669
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,230
Take your time.

670
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:45,630


671
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,391
Please look at the
beautiful part of my house.

672
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:51,630
Wow, it is amazing.

673
01:29:55,615 --> 01:29:56,615
It is beautiful as usual.

674
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,390
Is it?

675
01:29:58,450 --> 01:29:59,970
Should I open it more?

676
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,340
Yes, you should.

677
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:05,130
I want to show you more closely.

678
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:11,250
Please look at this.

679
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,950
How do you like it?

680
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:16,650
Please look at it carefully.

681
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:17,970
It's beautiful, isn't it?

682
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:19,310
Please do not look at it.

683
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,100
I am looking at it.

684
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:34,080
I like to be looked at.

685
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,180
I was thinking.

686
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,820
You are a little wet.

687
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:45,660
I am sorry.

688
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,360
I am sorry.

689
01:30:47,805 --> 01:30:49,406
I am wet because I am naked in this place.

690
01:30:51,035 --> 01:30:57,840
If other people see you
naked... You, too... I do not like it.

691
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,660
You like it.

692
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,440
Because I like to be embarrassed.

693
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,140
Do you always look like this?

694
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:07,720
That is what it looks like.

695
01:31:07,721 --> 01:31:09,480
It's
the same as usual, isn't it? Yes, it is.

696
01:31:09,481 --> 01:31:11,080
Do you always enjoy
like this? Yes, I do.

697
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:11,780


698
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,496
Because you
were holding the microphone just now.

699
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,520
Yes, I did.

700
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,540
What is wrong?

701
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,140
What is going on?

702
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,180
I think it is a little tight.

703
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,400
It is tight.

704
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,990
Excuse me.

705
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:44,350
What?

706
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,550
What are you
going to do? Oh, I see.

707
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:48,810


708
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:51,306
You three are
neighbors, aren't you? Yes, we are.

709
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,330
Oh, I see.

710
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:54,890


711
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:56,270
What?

712
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,090
Oh, you don't
like it? No, I don't.

713
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,590
It is OK.

714
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:02,230
It is OK.

715
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:03,350


716
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,390
Let's have fun together.

717
01:32:06,391 --> 01:32:07,391
Oh, you don't
like it? No, I don't.

718
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:09,430
Oh, you don't
like it? No, I don't.

719
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:11,131
Oh, you don't
like it? No, I don't.

720
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:12,950


721
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:16,530
Oh, you don't
like it? It is okay.

722
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,630
It is okay.

723
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:20,150
I played with you too much.

724
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:21,810
I am sorry.

725
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,610
You always do such a thing.

726
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:32,490
Isn't it good to
do this? It is small.

727
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040


728
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:36,210
I am doing my best.

729
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:26,370
Please look at him.

730
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:34,790
Please look at him.

731
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,290
Oh, it feels good.

732
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,940
I am going to kiss you.

733
01:33:54,840 --> 01:34:12,800
I am going to kiss you.

734
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:44,400

736
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:51,200
I have been beaten by many people
next to me, but I have become so hard.

737
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,520
You are fine.

738
01:34:55,521 --> 01:34:56,521
Yes, I am fine.

739
01:35:01,585 --> 01:35:02,866
I didn't know it was so painful.

740
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,140
I do not like this kind of pain.

741
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,360
I do not like this kind of pain.

742
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,600
I do not like this kind of pain.

743
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,880
I do not like this kind of pain.

744
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,960
How do you feel? I am sorry.

745
01:35:10,961 --> 01:35:11,961
It is okay.

746
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,420


747
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:16,440
I hope you enjoy it.

748
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,800
Are you okay?

749
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,200
It is so intense, isn't it?

750
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,040
I didn't expect it to be so windy.

751
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,240
Really?

752
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,960
I didn't expect it to be so windy.

753
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:31,820
Your body is like this.

754
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,600
It is very beautiful.

755
01:35:42,970 --> 01:36:21,000
This video is
a derivative work of the Touhou Project.

756
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:33,120
I am doing such a thing, and I am being
touched by a person who doesn't have a body.

757
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,560
I hope we can get along with each other.

758
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:54,800
I am waiting for you.

759
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,160
I am sorry.

760
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,060
Do you want me to take off your panties?

761
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:28,580
What are you doing?

762
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,260
Isn't this fun?

763
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:44,700
Are you having
fun? I am so sorry.

764
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,100


765
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,220
But...

766
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,600
I am so sorry.

767
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:51,760
You can feel more.

768
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,500
I am sorry.

769
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,460
I am sorry for coming back.

770
01:38:15,735 --> 01:38:16,735
I am sorry.

771
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,800
I am sorry.

772
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:20,230
I am sorry.

773
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:23,470
Ah...

774
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,480
Ah...

775
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,041
Ah... Ah...

776
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,720
Ah...

777
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,780
Ah... Ah...

778
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,120
Ah... Ah...

779
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:46,161
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

780
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,880
Ah...

781
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,351
You have a lot of blood clots.

782
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,780
I am going to put a lot of food in the box.

783
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:16,280
I am going to put a lot of food in the box.

784
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:21,320
Please lick my mark properly tonight.

785
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:22,880
I know. I know.

786
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,200
I will lick it a lot.

787
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:37,020
I do not know
if it is better than mine, but it is burnt.

788
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,600
I know.

789
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:18,620
Please touch my nipple.

790
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,620
I am so sorry.

791
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:28,970
Are you OK?

792
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:34,300
Stand up straight.

793
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,800
I am so sorry.

794
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:40,360
I am so sorry.

795
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:40,760
I am so sorry.

796
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,240
You are getting better and better.

797
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,560
I am so sorry.

798
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,660
I am so sorry.

799
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:56,661
I am sorry.

800
01:42:08,545 --> 01:42:09,545
You are good.

801
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,760
You are very active.

802
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,080
Let's kiss.

803
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,240
Let's kiss.

804
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:36,241
I see.

805
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,180
You are a good boy.

806
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,280
You are a good husband.

807
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,160
Please look this way, too.

808
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,260
I am so nervous.

809
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:10,750
It feels good, doesn't it?

810
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,410
Well, I am going to lick you.

811
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,310
How do you feel?
Are you licked by your husband?

812
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:20,111
How do you feel when
you are licked by a dog?

813
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,410
Dog is very naughty.

814
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:27,610
How do you feel?

815
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:30,370
Dog is very naughty.

816
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:36,530
I am glad.

817
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,310
Do you want to lick this side?

818
01:43:40,311 --> 01:43:41,970
It is getting warmer and warmer.

819
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,050
It is a little different from when
I was at my husband's house.

820
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,921
How is it compared to your husband's house?

821
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:52,350
Is it bigger over there?

822
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:57,310
It is a little slanted over there.

823
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:02,310
Slanted?

824
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:08,410
It is a little different.

825
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:15,990
It's a 500-year-old house, isn't it?

826
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:25,930
Do you feel good around here?

827
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:28,830
It is a strange feeling.

828
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:34,850
It is just right. It feels good.

829
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:38,830
It is really good.

830
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,970
This is the first time I have
ever seen a cat with such a good technique.

831
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:53,510
I have never seen a cat with such a
good technique.

832
01:44:57,070 --> 01:45:00,250
I have never seen a cat with such a
good technique.

833
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:02,210
It has been a long time.

834
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:04,830
It has been a long time.

835
01:45:05,805 --> 01:45:07,210
Really? I am glad to hear that.

836
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:10,490
It feels good.

837
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:12,850
I am so excited about this kind of thing.

838
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:14,670
I agree.

839
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:18,410
My wife is looking down on a man.

840
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,310
I don't like that.

841
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:22,701
She looks like she is in a good mood.

842
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:24,990
I see.

843
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:26,650
I am jealous.

844
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:29,290
You look like you are in a good mood, too.

845
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,750
It is so comfortable.

846
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:35,050
Your wife is so good.

847
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:40,590
It is so soft.

848
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:47,710
You look more
comfortable than when I was eating.

849
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,490
Do I?

850
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:53,750
Both are comfortable.

851
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:56,530
Do you feel good?

852
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:57,810
Yes.

853
01:45:57,811 --> 01:45:58,811
It feels so good.

854
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:00,050
You can do it.

855
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,430
This is your true nature.

856
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:04,870
You can do it.

857
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:09,570
But you were licking me so hard just now.

858
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:13,710
That is because I'm
feeling better and better.

859
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,090
We are the same.

860
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:19,190
Let's enjoy it.

861
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,540
Hey, how do
you feel? I feel good.

862
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,080


863
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:42,620
You smell so good.

864
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,760
Your tongue is wet.

865
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:46,600
You smell so good.

866
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:47,601
I know, I know.

867
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,340
You smell so good.

868
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,220
You are shaking.

869
01:46:54,310 --> 01:46:55,310
You look so good.

870
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,520
You and my husband, too.

871
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,640
He is talking with all his might.

872
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:10,780
Yes, he is.

873
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:14,720
He is trying to imitate a very erotic way.

874
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

875
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,680
What is this?

876
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:34,260
Are you okay? Yes, I am okay.

877
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:36,580
I am sorry.

878
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:40,020
I am sorry.

879
01:47:40,021 --> 01:47:40,040
I am sorry.

880
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,060
I am sorry.

881
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,420
I am sorry.

882
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:47,520
I am sorry.

883
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,200
I am sorry.

884
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:51,580
I am sorry.

885
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,520
I am sorry.

886
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:53,580


887
01:47:54,460 --> 01:48:22,640
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25, 26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33

888
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:25,020
It is a hot spring.
It is a hot spring.

889
01:48:25,670 --> 01:48:27,080
But it is very delicious.

890
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,920
I am getting jealous.

891
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,320
It is delicious.

892
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,311
I am jealous of the person next to you.

893
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,660
But you feel good, too.

894
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,460
I understand. I will do my best.

895
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,580
Is it weak here?

896
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:05,420
It is a little sensitive.

897
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,200
Oh, it is sensitive.

898
01:49:06,201 --> 01:49:07,201
I see.

899
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,120
It is refreshing to be
kissed and waved hands.

900
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:22,640
But it is a little harder than before.

901
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:26,280
It feels good. It is a fresh feeling.

902
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,760
Can you do that much for my wife?

903
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:29,761
I hope you do not do that.

904
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:31,640
Oh, my God.

905
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:34,080
I hope you do not do that.

906
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:36,600
Oh, my God.

907
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,640
Oh, my God.

908
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:39,921
You can do whatever you want.

909
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,940
You can do whatever you want.

910
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:45,920
Oh, my God.

911
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,080
Oh, my God.

912
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,180
Oh, my God.

913
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,220
Oh, my God.

914
01:49:50,221 --> 01:49:51,221
Oh, my God.

915
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:56,580
Oh, my God.

916
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:58,891
I love this kind of thing.

917
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:07,320
You are very sensitive.

918
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:12,760
Do you like to eat? It is fresh.

919
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,480


920
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,540
It is fresh, isn't it?

921
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,660
Can you feed me?

922
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,540
I will feed you a lot.

923
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:38,880
It is the first
time I have ever seen such a finger nail.

924
01:50:41,665 --> 01:50:43,080
It is hard, isn't it? It is scary.

925
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:54,510


926
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:55,960
It is not scary at all.

927
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,520
I am going to give you a massage.

928
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:14,080
I am going to massage your back.

929
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,280
How was it? I like it.

930
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,600


931
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,140
Really?

932
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:24,000
Yes.

933
01:51:24,001 --> 01:51:24,180
Was it good?

934
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,640
Yes.

935
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:28,500
I feel good.

936
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,831
I am going to give you a head massage.

937
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:40,570
I am going to give you a head massage.

938
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:49,690
I am going to give you a head massage.

939
01:51:49,691 --> 01:51:50,530
I am going to give you a head massage.

940
01:51:50,531 --> 01:51:50,830
I am going to give you a head massage.

941
01:51:50,831 --> 01:51:52,890
I am going to give you a head massage.

942
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:54,390
I am going to give you a head massage.

943
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:57,990
I am going to give you a head massage.

944
01:51:57,991 --> 01:51:58,010
I am going to give you a head massage.

945
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:19,990
Do not do seizures!

946
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,500
Do not do seizures on your back!

947
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,440
DON'T DO SEIZURES ON YOUR BACK!

948
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:46,420
I am going to bring you to my home.

949
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:06,530
It feels so good.

950
01:53:08,485 --> 01:53:10,410
It is like I am in a hospital.

951
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:25,030
I feel like we've become
really close today.

952
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,550
Yes, we have.

953
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:28,890
Yes, we have.

954
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:30,910
But I wish we could be closer.

955
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:34,190
Yes, let's do more of what we usually do.

956
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:35,790
More? Yes, more.

957
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:36,850
I don't know.

958
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:38,110
Let's use that.

959
01:53:38,370 --> 01:53:39,370


960
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,050
Yes, let's use it.

961
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:43,770
Yes, let's use it.

962
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:45,630
You are all wet.

963
01:53:45,631 --> 01:53:46,631
I am sorry.

964
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,730
Are you okay?

965
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,700
Are you okay?

966
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:00,940
Are you okay?

967
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:04,660
Are you okay?

968
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:06,680
Are you okay?

969
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:11,840
Are you okay?

970
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,340
Are you okay?

971
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,840
Are you okay?

972
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,040
Are you okay?

973
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:46,880
This video is a derivative work of the
Tohoku Prefecture Tourism Promotion Agency.

974

Please use the translation function
of YouTube as a reference.

975
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,080
It is a very strong reaction, isn't it?

976
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:54,900
Well, I feel good just to do this.

977
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:59,600
I feel like something is buzzing.

978
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:06,620
It is getting more and more overflowing.

979
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:10,480
It is embarrassing.

980
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:11,560
What are you doing?

981
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:12,860
It is buzzing from there.

982
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:14,700
Don't shake me.

983
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:17,880
She is moving a lot.

984
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,100
She is moving a lot.

985
01:55:20,101 --> 01:55:21,240
Are you OK?

986
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:25,580
Are you OK?

987
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:27,940
She looks comfortable.

988
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,920
Her hips are shaking.

989
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:37,920
Are you OK?

990
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:39,200
Are you OK?

991
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:02,170
Mother's movements are very
different from the previous video.

992
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:13,567
The movement
of the neck is different from the previous

993
01:56:13,579 --> 01:56:16,850
The video, and the movements
of the chest and head of her are different.

994
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:17,342
It is not as
if the movement of the neck is the same

995
01:56:17,354 --> 01:56:17,810
as the video, but it's
different from the video.

996
01:56:17,811 --> 01:56:17,890
It is difficult to understand the reason
for this difference.

997
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,040
Yes, that is right.

998
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:23,631
Is it okay to do the acupressure here?

999
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:35,390
You wanted it so much, didn't you?

1000
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:37,650
Yes.

1001
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:41,370
Are you okay?

1002
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:42,630
Yes.

1003
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:54,720
Please look at where
you are breathing and moving your body.

1004
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,220
Please move your body.

1005
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:15,780
How is it?

1006
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,740
What is this?

1007
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:28,060
What is this?

1008
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:32,090
Are you crying?

1009
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,360
Are you crying?

1010
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:46,820
Are you crying?

1011
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,660
Are you crying?

1012
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,040
We are going to use a special machine,

1013
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:33,001
and I am going
to give you a massage with my hand.

1014
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:42,380
You can just do whatever you want.

1015
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:50,880
I do not like this kind of massage...

1016
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:54,640
I am sorry.

1017
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,780
Are you okay?

1018
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,740
I am going to go.

1019
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,280
Okay. You can go as much as you want.

1020
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:08,530
Your nipples are so dirty.

1021
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:33,510
Did you go?

1022
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,960
This is the first time I have ever
seen a baby crying like this in my life.

1023
02:00:13,961 --> 02:00:16,601
I am sure it is a lot different from
when I was in the neighborhood.

1024
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:36,530
I am sure it is a lot different from
when I was in the neighborhood.

1025
02:00:36,531 --> 02:00:36,590
I am sure it is a lot different from
when I was in the neighborhood.

1026
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:38,986
I am sure it is a lot different from
when I was in the neighborhood.

1027
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:11,980
Are you okay? Let's do it.

1028
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:50,330
Good.

1029
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:59,030
Good.

1030
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:04,890
Good.

1031
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:06,870


1032
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,550
It feels good, doesn't it?

1033
02:02:09,630 --> 02:02:11,210
It's painful, isn't it?

1034
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:12,550
It's painful, isn't it?

1035
02:02:12,790 --> 02:02:15,310
It's painful, isn't it?

1036
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:19,530
It's painful, isn't it?
I am sorry.

1037
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:24,800
It is okay.

1038
02:02:24,801 --> 02:02:25,801


1039
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:50,200
I want to go there.

1040
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,580
It is okay.

1041
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:55,120
I want to go there.

1042
02:02:55,121 --> 02:02:55,300
It is okay.

1043
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:56,200
It is okay.

1044
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:05,390
I can't do it anymore.

1045
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:07,890
It is okay.

1046
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:09,870
I don't want to do it.

1047
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:11,850
I can't sleep anymore.

1048
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:19,030
Are you OK?

1049
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:23,550
I can't do it anymore. I am going to faint.

1050
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:28,530
I do not feel like I can do it by myself.

1051
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:31,550
Let's put it in.

1052
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:34,910
I put it in.

1053
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:37,030
It feels good,
doesn't it? I see.

1054
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:37,630
It feels good.

1055
02:03:38,350 --> 02:03:38,890
It feels good.

1056
02:03:38,891 --> 02:03:39,891
It feels good.

1057
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:44,870


1058
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:47,990
It feels so good.

1059
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:50,750
Does it? I envy you all.

1060
02:03:53,410 --> 02:03:55,730
You always want to put something in
your mouth, do not you? I will put it in.

1061
02:03:58,290 --> 02:03:59,970
I will put it in.

1062
02:04:02,635 --> 02:04:03,950
I am glad.

1063
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:06,850


1064
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:16,550
Did you put it in?

1065
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:18,610
I couldn't stand it.

1066
02:04:19,450 --> 02:04:21,030
Let me know how you feel later.

1067
02:04:21,870 --> 02:04:22,870
Thank you.

1068
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:24,730
It is really tight.

1069
02:04:41,290 --> 02:04:50,570
Is it hard to deal with?

1070
02:04:51,490 --> 02:04:52,330
Are you okay?

1071
02:04:52,331 --> 02:04:52,510
Are you OK?

1072
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:53,110
Are you OK?

1073
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:54,070
Are you OK?

1074
02:04:54,071 --> 02:04:54,150
Are you OK?

1075
02:04:54,910 --> 02:04:55,330
Are you OK?

1076
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:56,690
Are you OK?

1077
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,840
Are you OK?

1078
02:04:58,710 --> 02:04:59,930
Are you OK?

1079
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:01,150
Are you OK?

1080
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,730
Are you OK?

1081
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:08,930
Are you OK?

1082
02:05:10,570 --> 02:05:15,050
Are you OK?

1083
02:05:15,051 --> 02:05:17,150
Let's show it to your husband.

1084
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,650
You look so comfortable.

1085
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,810
I am not comfortable at all.

1086
02:05:29,005 --> 02:05:31,210
Do you feel it? Yes, I do.

1087
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:32,850
My wife is so.

1088
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:41,430
..

1089
02:05:41,431 --> 02:05:42,431
What?

1090
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:43,970
I know, right?

1091
02:05:43,971 --> 02:05:46,430
Your husband is pretty amazing, too.

1092
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:49,250
That is not true.

1093
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:50,270
I am not that cute.

1094
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:55,630
No, no, no.

1095
02:05:57,390 --> 02:05:59,650
I put it in there.

1096
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:03,490
It's tight, isn't it?

1097
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:05,910
It is really tight.

1098
02:06:06,290 --> 02:06:07,330
It is tight.

1099
02:06:07,331 --> 02:06:12,330
I want you to show me your face again.

1100
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:16,610
Can you show me your back?

1101
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:26,850
You have a beautiful body.

1102
02:06:26,851 --> 02:06:27,851
Are you OK?

1103
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:30,590
Are you OK?

1104
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:37,550
You are very strong.

1105
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:43,670
You are strong.

1106
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:50,750
Are you OK?

1107
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:10,210
[Crying] I am sorry.

1108
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,750
I am sorry.

1109
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:14,090


1110
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:26,020
I will not do it again.

1111
02:07:26,635 --> 02:07:29,720
It's terrible, isn't it?

1112
02:07:32,230 --> 02:07:33,600
She is gone again.

1113
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:38,940
I am sorry.

1114
02:07:38,941 --> 02:07:40,040
I am so sorry.

1115
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,300
I am so sorry.

1116
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:10,940
I am so sorry.

1117
02:08:10,941 --> 02:08:11,941
I am so sorry.

1118
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:15,620
I am so sorry.

1119
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:35,440
I am so sorry.

1120
02:08:58,045 --> 02:08:59,950
I am sorry.

1121
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:06,630
I am sorry.

1122
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:12,590
I am sorry.

1123
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,540
I am sorry.

1124
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:24,920
I am sorry.

1125
02:09:24,921 --> 02:09:25,921
I am sorry.

1126
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,160
I am sorry.

1127
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:34,451
This is the first time I have ever seen
such a thing.

1128
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:36,331
Can you hold it in your arms?

1129
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,280
Yes.

1130
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,480
Oh, my God.

1131
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:50,740
I am going to die.

1132
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:54,040
Turn your back to me.

1133
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:57,560
I want you
to show me your beautiful buttocks.

1134
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:09,610
Oh, it's good.

1135
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:13,790
Oh, it's good.

1136
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:15,520
Is it around here?

1137
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:16,970
Yes, it is around here.

1138
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,690
Oh, it's good.

1139
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:25,220
Oh, it's good.

1140
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:27,230
Oh, it's good.

1141
02:10:27,690 --> 02:10:28,590
Oh, it's good.

1142
02:10:28,591 --> 02:10:31,330
You can move your hips as much as you like.

1143
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:33,530
Can I move?

1144
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:35,171
Yes, you can move more and more.

1145
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:41,650
Are you OK? Yes, I am.

1146
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:43,250


1147
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:44,350
Let me give you a hug.

1148
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,900
Let me give you a hug.

1149
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,180
It feels good, doesn't it?

1150
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:02,760
Let me give you a hug, too.

1151
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:44,060
It is heavy.

1152
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:46,060
I can't do it.

1153
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:47,160
You can't?

1154
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:52,300
I want to take it off.

1155
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:54,260
You can take it off.

1156
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:55,720
Oh, it's heavy.

1157
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:02,010
I can't do it.

1158
02:12:04,610 --> 02:12:07,090
It feels so good.

1159
02:12:07,450 --> 02:12:07,730
How do you feel?

1160
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:08,970
I can't move it.

1161
02:12:10,890 --> 02:12:13,670
You are like a child.

1162
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:17,230
It feels so good.

1163
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:40,650

1165
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:11,930
It feels good to touch
my mom's body to her mouth of the earth.

1166
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:12,470
It feels good.

1167
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:15,190
It feels good when you touch me.

1168
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,510
You have been touching me for a while.

1169
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:20,630
I am sorry.

1170
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:22,170
I am sorry.

1171
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:24,570
I am sorry.

1172
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:27,490
You do not have to be patient.

1173
02:13:28,490 --> 02:13:30,110
I am sorry.

1174
02:13:30,150 --> 02:13:31,150
I am sorry.

1175
02:13:31,610 --> 02:13:32,610
I am sorry.

1176
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:38,680
It is gone.

1177
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:40,840
It is gone.

1178
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:45,780
I feel like I am being attacked by a demon.

1179
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,780
It was dangerous.

1180
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:50,940
I thought you could do a little more.

1181
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:52,140
No way!

1182
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:54,260
You were so strong.

1183
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:56,000
I was able to finish it in a second.

1184
02:13:58,580 --> 02:13:59,820
No way!

1185
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:00,720
No way!

1186
02:14:01,070 --> 02:14:02,760
It was a different way to finish.

1187
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:05,560
I felt like I could finish it in the back.

1188
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:07,380
No way!

1189
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:08,740
Is that so? I feel strange.

1190
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,401
How do you feel?

1191
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:13,340
Do you feel good?

1192
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:17,780
I feel good when I look at you.

1193
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:21,820
Do you feel good?

1194
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:25,580
I have never seen you like that before.

1195
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:28,620
I have never seen you like that before.

1196
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:33,960
I am showing you
a face that my wife has never seen before.

1197
02:14:33,961 --> 02:14:41,500
It has been a long time since I have had
a young baby, and I am so jealous of you.

1198
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,300
I like young babies.

1199
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:47,680
I know.

1200
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,020
I know.

1201
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,580
I am so jealous of you.

1202
02:14:52,581 --> 02:14:53,581
I am getting older.

1203
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,100
I am so jealous of you.

1204
02:14:56,101 --> 02:15:01,920
I want you to be with me all the time.

1205
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:07,400
That is what you want, isn't it?

1206
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:08,920
Yes.

1207
02:15:09,490 --> 02:15:11,920
It feels good, doesn't it?

1208
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:14,340
It feels good, doesn't it?

1209
02:15:19,630 --> 02:15:21,040
It is about time.

1210
02:15:22,810 --> 02:15:23,810
It is about time.

1211
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:26,800
I feel like I want you.

1212
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:29,560
I feel like I want you.

1213
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:38,900
It is about time.

1214
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:49,640
I am sorry. I can't do this alone.

1215
02:15:51,380 --> 02:15:52,380
Is that so? That is great.

1216
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:55,420


1217
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:58,780
You know, I like to
be patted by other people.

1218
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:02,060
Is that so?

1219
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:04,100
Yes.

1220
02:16:44,081 --> 02:16:48,040
My mom is crazy.

1221
02:16:50,220 --> 02:16:52,340
My mom is crazy.

1222
02:16:53,220 --> 02:17:00,080
My mom is crazy.

1223
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:17,260
My mom is crazy.

1224
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:18,380
I knew it.

1225
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:19,900
I am sorry.

1226
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:21,080
How do you feel? I feel better.

1227
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:29,730


1228
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:30,930
Really?

1229
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:32,470
I can't lose to you.

1230
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:37,750
I want to get along with you more.

1231
02:17:38,730 --> 02:17:39,730
Let's get along.

1232
02:17:40,895 --> 02:17:41,935
I am sure you will feel good.

1233
02:17:44,030 --> 02:17:45,350
You have seen my wife, haven't you?

1234
02:17:46,790 --> 02:17:48,350
Let's get along.

1235
02:17:49,230 --> 02:17:50,270
Let's get along.

1236
02:18:00,670 --> 02:18:02,090
I feel like I am going to throw up.

1237
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:04,450
I am going to throw up.

1238
02:18:07,950 --> 02:18:13,800
I am going to throw up.

1239
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:27,830
That is a lot.

1240
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:30,530
You were in trouble.

1241
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:32,810
No, I wasn't.

1242
02:18:32,811 --> 02:18:34,790
It felt so good.

1243
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:36,670
Did it?

1244
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:39,490
I am so happy to have a girlfriend like you.

1245
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:41,186
I am so happy to have a girlfriend like you.

1246
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:41,450
I am so happy to have a girlfriend like you.

1247
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:42,630
Tonight, right?

1248
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:42,770
Yes.

1249
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:44,310
Will you do it again?

1250
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:46,350
I might do it again.

1251
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:48,370
That is great.

1252
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:50,630
Then, let's go home.

1253
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:51,870
Let's go.

1254
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:03,810
Are you okay? Yes, I am fine.

1255
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,200


1256
02:19:06,530 --> 02:19:07,891
I am looking forward to seeing you.

1257
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:09,890
Mr. Yamaguchi.

1258
02:19:11,190 --> 02:19:12,310
Mr. Junagana.

1259
02:19:12,890 --> 02:19:13,890
Mr. Tanaka.

1260
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:21,626
You have only been married
for a year, haven't you? That is right.

1261
02:19:21,650 --> 02:19:22,650


1262
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:24,150
It has been a year.

1263
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:29,060
I am looking forward to seeing you.

1264
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:58,720
I am embarrassed.

1265
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:01,300
I am embarrassed.

1266
02:20:02,645 --> 02:20:04,140
I am embarrassed.

1267
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:05,880
I am embarrassed.

1268
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:11,320
I have never done this before.

1269
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:18,390
I am embarrassed.

1270
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:46,540
Sui-kun.

1271
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,300
Yes?

1272
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:48,680
You took it off.

1273
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:49,200
Eh?

1274
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,860
I took it off, too.

1275
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,400
Then, let's have fun.

1276
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:58,880
Let's have fun.

1277
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:18,080
Wow.

1278
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:38,580
I am going to take a bath.

1279
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:50,890
Hey, lady.

1280
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:53,150
Hey, lady.

1281
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:55,890
I am sorry. I do not need any electricity.

1282
02:21:56,650 --> 02:21:57,650
I am sorry.

1283
02:21:58,710 --> 02:21:59,710
It is over there.

1284
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:01,310
Oh, I see.

1285
02:22:11,170 --> 02:22:13,970
I am going to look at your skin.

1286
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:16,160
Oh, go ahead.

1287
02:22:16,490 --> 02:22:17,490
Please look at my skin.

1288
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:20,770
Look.

1289
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:22,350
It is hard.

1290
02:22:25,865 --> 02:22:27,380
It is harder than I thought.

1291
02:22:39,485 --> 02:22:40,870
Your wife is so cute.

1292
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:54,660
I am sorry.

1293
02:23:56,180 --> 02:24:17,580
Oh, my God!

1294
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:18,380
She is That is so cute!

1295
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:19,620
That is great!

1296
02:24:33,310 --> 02:24:40,050
Even the fingers of her feet are cute.

1297
02:24:40,450 --> 02:24:42,010
Oh, my God!

1298
02:24:42,450 --> 02:24:43,450
What is that?

1299
02:24:43,451 --> 02:24:45,840
I can't stop moving.

1300
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:34,670
Are you heavy? It is great.

1301
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:49,190
Good boy.

1302
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:41,970


1303
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:56,900
You are a good boy.

1304
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,680
You are a good boy.

1305
02:26:59,681 --> 02:27:00,681
You are a good boy.

1306
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:20,350
You are beautiful.

1307
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:25,610
You have a lot of muscles.

1308
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:28,970
Let's eat.

1309
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:37,970
My wife is getting bigger and bigger.

1310
02:28:38,250 --> 02:28:39,410
How about your wife?

1311
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:43,390
She is getting bigger and bigger.

1312
02:28:44,130 --> 02:28:45,810
My body is getting bigger and bigger.

1313
02:28:47,490 --> 02:28:52,210
My body is getting bigger and bigger.

1314
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:39,020
This is the first
time I have ever seen a baby cry like this.

1315
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,040
The baby is crying.

1316
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:48,260
The baby is crying.

1317
02:29:52,510 --> 02:30:01,450
Fubuki, 26, is the oldest in the world.

1318
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:08,280
Fubuki's father
is the Go-chan of the Go-chan family.

1319
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:12,420
He is the father of
Fubuki, who is the second oldest in Japan.

1320
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:15,600
Fubuki is the first child to have a child.

1321
02:30:15,655 --> 02:30:18,095
Fubuki's father, Go-chan, is
a manager of the Go-chan family.

1322
02:30:22,660 --> 02:30:23,660
Look!

1323
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:25,640
Look!

1324
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:28,440
That is amazing!

1325
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:31,800
I want to eat it, too.

1326
02:30:44,470 --> 02:30:45,590
It is good,
isn't it? It is delicious.

1327
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:48,330


1328
02:32:39,850 --> 02:32:51,740
I am going to show you how to make a toy.

1329
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:03,000
I am going to show you how to make a toy.

1330
02:33:03,001 --> 02:33:04,001
I have a toy at home.

1331
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:05,460
I have a toy at home.

1332
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:12,980

1333
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:14,380
I have two toys.

1334
02:33:14,381 --> 02:33:18,740
This is a great toy.

1335
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,120
Do you know this?

1336
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:21,560
I have seen it before.

1337
02:33:22,585 --> 02:33:34,950
I have seen it in a video.

1338
02:33:41,090 --> 02:33:42,090
I am going to sleep.

1339
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:42,790
When?

1340
02:33:43,050 --> 02:33:44,050
Yes.

1341
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:32,600
The baby is crying.

1342
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:34,660
Does it feel good?

1343
02:36:02,830 --> 02:36:04,070
You can cry once.

1344
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:26,890
How do you feel? It feels good.

1345
02:36:27,650 --> 02:36:29,090


1346
02:36:29,290 --> 02:36:30,290
Does it feel good?

1347
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:30,550
Yes.

1348
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:32,270
The baby is crying.

1349
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:33,990
I am glad.

1350
02:36:33,991 --> 02:36:34,991
I can't do it anymore.

1351
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,390
I will do it more.

1352
02:36:38,610 --> 02:36:40,030
Please do it more.

1353
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:08,470
I have done it once.

1354
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:10,550
I want to do it more and more.

1355
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:13,390
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying like this.

1356
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:32,100
The baby's crying is so cute.

1357
02:38:32,101 --> 02:38:33,360
The baby's crying is so cute.

1358
02:38:39,330 --> 02:38:40,890
The baby's crying is so cute.

1359
02:38:49,890 --> 02:38:57,590
The baby's crying is so cute.

1360
02:38:57,591 --> 02:38:58,591
I am sorry.

1361
02:39:00,315 --> 02:39:36,750
I am sorry.

1362
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,160
Did you have fun?

1363
02:40:48,620 --> 02:40:50,220
I had a lot of fun.

1364
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:53,260
I will give you your wife back.

1365
02:40:58,510 --> 02:41:00,000
Your waist is cracked.

1366
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:09,860
It is more exciting than stretching.

1367
02:41:10,450 --> 02:41:11,450
This is good.

1368
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:30,280
It is getting harder.

1369
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:16,730
This is the first time I have ever seen a
cat like this, and I am very happy to see it.

1370
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:19,510
I am glad I was able to film this video.

1371
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,570
I am glad I was able to film this video.

1372
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:52,270
I feel good.

1373
02:42:52,271 --> 02:42:53,471
Do you want to change
the bed? I feel good.

1374
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:59,390


1375
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:02,730
Do you want to change
the bed? Hey, Suzuki.

1376
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:20,540


1377
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:22,440
This is my wife, Fella.

1378
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,600
I feel good.

1379
02:43:25,730 --> 02:43:27,080
Your wife is good at cooking.

1380
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,620
Thank you.

1381
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:33,140
I am going to do my best to wash it.

1382
02:45:57,590 --> 02:45:59,090
We have a guest.

1383
02:46:00,230 --> 02:46:04,970
He was a dog born in 1964.

1384
02:46:04,971 --> 02:46:05,290
It has been a long time since we've
talked about dogs to each other.

1385
02:46:05,291 --> 02:46:07,572
He is a dog that
has been living in our home for a while.

1386
02:46:10,570 --> 02:46:16,240
He has been a pet for more than 10 years.

1387
02:46:29,850 --> 02:46:39,150
I am going to give you a massage today.

1388
02:46:39,151 --> 02:46:40,671
I am going to give you a massage today.

1389
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:44,690
I am going to give you a massage today.

1390
02:46:44,691 --> 02:46:46,051
Look. It is the one in the dustbin.

1391
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:49,740
You can throw it to the trash bin.

1392
02:46:57,930 --> 02:46:59,910
I hope the balloon will not fly away.

1393
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:04,050
It is a waste of time.

1394
02:47:04,410 --> 02:47:05,410
It is a waste of time.

1395
02:47:05,470 --> 02:47:05,610
You can't do anything.

1396
02:47:05,611 --> 02:47:06,611
It is broken.

1397
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:15,400
President, please.

1398
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:17,180
I can't get the answer.

1399
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:19,440
Here you are.

1400
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:20,860
Thank you.

1401
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:29,410
This is a video taken in the morning
of the day I gave birth to my second child.

1402
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:51,480
I am going to show you a video of the
day I gave birth to my second child.

1403
02:47:51,481 --> 02:47:52,240
I am going to show you a video of the
day I gave birth to my second child.

1404
02:47:52,241 --> 02:47:54,800
I have a bad feeling about this.

1405
02:47:54,801 --> 02:47:56,081
I have a bad feeling about this.

1406
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:02,440
I am sleepy more than usual.

1407
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:04,540
What is wrong?

1408
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:14,290
You only talk to me.

1409
02:48:44,560 --> 02:49:14,780
Do you want to go back again?

1410
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:32,700
I feel like I am in a dream.

1411
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:34,400
I can't help talking about the game.

1412
02:49:42,310 --> 02:49:45,230
It must be fun.

1413
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:48,930
I have never had such a good time.

1414
02:49:49,590 --> 02:49:51,410
This world is a good place, isn't it?

1415
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:55,090
I am going to get addicted to this game.

1416
02:49:58,780 --> 02:50:03,510
How is it, ladies?

1417
02:50:04,685 --> 02:50:07,190
Is it OK if I just touch your mouth?

1418
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:10,310
Where else do you want me to touch?

1419
02:50:30,450 --> 02:50:40,570
This is the first time I
have ever seen such a cute baby in my life.

1420
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:44,610
I am so happy to see him.

1421
02:50:48,250 --> 02:50:49,510
I am so happy to see him.

1422
02:50:49,511 --> 02:50:51,310
Look, look.

1423
02:50:53,810 --> 02:50:54,810
Wow!

1424
02:50:55,810 --> 02:50:56,810
It is a surprise.

1425
02:50:57,230 --> 02:50:59,030
Oh, my.

1426
02:50:59,770 --> 02:51:00,710
I am glad to see you.

1427
02:51:00,711 --> 02:51:01,711
I am glad to see you.

1428
02:51:02,290 --> 02:51:03,290
Ah! Ah! I am sorry.

1429
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:06,610


1430
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:08,110


1431
02:51:08,310 --> 02:51:10,470
I am sorry to make you feel bad.

1432
02:51:11,310 --> 02:51:12,310
I am sorry.

1433
02:51:13,050 --> 02:51:14,050
Ah!

1434
02:51:15,370 --> 02:51:16,610
Ah! I am so sorry.

1435
02:51:18,650 --> 02:51:34,500
I am so sorry.

1436
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:39,780
I am so sorry.

1437
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:42,140
I am so sorry.

1438
02:51:50,430 --> 02:53:53,870


1439
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:28,720
This is the first time I've
ever seen a baby crying like this.

1440
02:56:28,721 --> 02:56:30,041
I am going to give him an IV drip.

1441
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:31,900
I am going to give him an IV drip.

1442
02:56:33,340 --> 02:57:18,930
I am going to give him an IV drip.

1443
02:57:25,330 --> 02:58:57,530
I am going to give him an IV drip.

1444
02:59:18,560 --> 02:59:19,960
Oh, my stomach.

1445
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:23,800
I am going to puke.

1446
02:59:24,340 --> 02:59:25,900
Hey, wait a minute.

1447
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:26,740
I am going to puke.

1448
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:46,030
I am so full.

1449
02:59:54,750 --> 02:59:57,480
Sue-kun, I put a lot of it in my stomach.

1450
02:59:58,220 --> 02:59:59,580
Oh, I see.

1451
03:00:00,980 --> 03:00:01,980
It is okay.

1452
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:02,260
What? Let me out now.

1453
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:03,380


1454
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:05,380
Are you sure?

1455
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:06,560
Yes.

1456
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:27,080
President, are
you sure? Yes, I am.

1457
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:28,520


1458
03:00:43,100 --> 03:00:44,460
Sue-kun, did you let
me out? Yes, I did.

1459
03:00:45,070 --> 03:00:46,140
I felt great.

1460
03:00:46,680 --> 03:00:47,680


1461
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:57,880
How do you feel?

1462
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:01,540
It was the best, boss.

1463
03:01:12,490 --> 03:01:15,060
Thank you, wife.
