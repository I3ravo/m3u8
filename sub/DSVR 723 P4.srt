1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,440
How was it?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,220
How was it?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:06,620
How was it?

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
How was it?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,480
It was good, wasn't it?

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,880
It was good, wasn't it?

7
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,200
It was good, wasn't it?

8
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:12,420
It was good, wasn't it?

9
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:12,780
It was good, wasn't it?

10
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:13,480
It was good, wasn't it?

11
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:13,980
It was good, wasn't it?

12
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,480
It was good, wasn't it?

13
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:15,800
It was good, wasn't it?

14
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,620
It was good, wasn't it?

15
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,540
It was good, wasn't it?

16
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,760
It was good, wasn't it?

17
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,380
It was good, wasn't it?

18
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,840
It was good, wasn't it?

19
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,960
It was good, wasn't it?

20
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,300
It was good, wasn't it?

21
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:46,520
It was good, wasn't it?

22
00:00:48,730 --> 00:01:10,070
Himawari is that place, right?

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:10,770
Yes.

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:24,710
It's like a tent to the other side.

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,730
The place where the bandits live.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,070
Borders are like that.

27
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,071
It's so scary.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,090
At that time, I thought
that I was like a master.

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,310
Kii-chan, come in!

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,750
What happened?

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,730
What? What? What?

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,550
I was surprised.

33
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,930
What are you doing?

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,410
What are you looking at?

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,550
What's wrong?

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,350
What were you looking at?

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,970
Did you hear it? No, no, no.

38
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,570


39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,570
Today is the day to win!

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,990
Congratulations!

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,890
What?

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,260
I don't think it's going to work.

43
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,270
It was amazing.

44
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,030
It was really good to play it four times.

45
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,710
Really?

46
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,430
Where do you
remember? It was amazing.

47
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,530
I think so, too.

48
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,910
I saw a lot of things.

49
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,490
I moved a little.

50
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,381
You usually sleep in a different place.

51
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,830
I want you to tell me that.

52
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,450
I want to see it.

53
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,730
Do you want to see it?

54
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,050
Do you want to see it?

55
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,570
Let's go to the next one.

56
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,710
Let's go to the next one.

57
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,490
It's dangerous.

58
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,330
It's true.

59
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:43,870
It's amazing.

60
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,390
You can still go.

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,290
The golden egg is still big.

62
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,190
Is it big?

63
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:49,650
Yes.

64
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,370
I haven't eaten yet.

65
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,050
I know. You ate a lot and came
here today, didn't you? No way.

66
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,890


67
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,170
How much did you eat?

68
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,010
That's a lot, isn't it?

69
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,211
Then you'll get a gallbladder.

70
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,470
That's right.

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,730
Or is it just a daily
routine? Daily routine.

72
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,850


73
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,190
But it doesn't feel like it.

74
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,390
I want to play more.

75
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,390
Let's eat.

76
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:16,391
Hello.

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,340
Let me kiss you.

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,750
Hello.

79
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,440
Hey, you're getting bigger.

80
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Wow! That's amazing.

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200


82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,940
I just kissed you.

83
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:48,620
Wow, it's amazing!

84
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:59,100
It's the best!

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
It's the best!

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
It's so much fun!

87
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,060
The kisses are getting bigger and bigger.

88
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,560
It's true.

89
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,980
It's getting bigger and bigger.

90
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,220
The tip of the nose is so sharp.

91
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,660
It's getting brighter.

92
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,821
It's really getting brighter.

93
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
It's getting brighter.

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Wow.

95
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,941
Did you just touch
something? I did.

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,760
I did.

97
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:47,761


98
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:09,073
It's been a long time since I've had a meal like this, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to eat it all at once

99
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,750
I want to sleep a little longer.

100
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,630
I want to sleep a little longer.

101
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,050
I want to sleep a little longer.

102
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:36,790
I want to sleep a little longer.

103
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:36,930
I want to sleep a little longer.

104
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,090
I want to sleep a little longer.

105
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,130
I want to sleep a little longer.

106
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:37,170
I want to sleep a little longer.

107
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:37,410
I want to sleep a little longer.

108
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,446
I want to sleep a little longer.

109
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,450
I want to sleep a little longer.

110
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:39,490
I want to sleep a little longer.

111
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:39,730
I want to sleep a little longer.

112
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,510
I want to sleep a little longer.

113
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,110
I want to sleep a little longer.

114
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,790
I want to sleep a little longer.

115
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,830
I want to sleep a little longer.

116
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,010
I want to sleep a little longer.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,560
Emotional Wow,
there are so many.

118
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
That's amazing.

119
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Isn't that amazing?

120
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,271
I don't want to go here at all.

121
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,740
Wow, there are so many, no matter how many.

122
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,580
We've got such good bonds.

123
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
It's so good.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm so tired.

125
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,831
Do you want me to do it again?

126
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,341
You want me to do it, don't you?

127
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,420
Do you want me to
do it again? It hurts.

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,320
It hurts.

129
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,820


130
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Yes.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
It hurts.

132
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,921
I want to eat it.

133
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I ate it.

134
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,520
Oh, no.

135
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,980
I'm so sleepy.

136
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:29,120
I want to eat more.

137
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,800
It's so hard.

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
What's going on? It's crazy.

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160


140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
It's really crazy.

141
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,600
It's true.

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
It feels good.

143
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,020
It's so hard.

144
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,980
It's so hard.

145
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
!!

146
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,460
Oh, did you send me a text message?

147
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,580
It's really nice to live a life of a girl.

148
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,020
It's just that I'm living a life of a girl.

150
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,880
I think I'll fall.

151
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Where are you going?

152
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
You guys are so erotic.

153
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,861
It's not good to look at it from here.

154
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,820
I know.

155
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,481
It's not good to look at it from here.

156
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,360
Are you still going to sleep?

157
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,361
Are you going to sleep?

158
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Are you going to sleep?

159
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,580
I want to see how much you sleep.

160
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,260
I want to see how much you sleep.

161
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,880
I want to see how much you sleep.

162
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,260
I want to see how much you sleep.

163
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:30,340
I want to see how much you sleep.

164
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:30,360
I want to see how much you sleep.

165
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:30,600
I want to see how much you sleep.

166
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,540
I want to see how much you sleep.

167
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,400
I want to see how much you sleep.

168
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,401
Wow!

169
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,220
It's like a facial expression.

170
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,180
It's not a facial expression,
but it's quite painful.

171
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,960
That's right.

172
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,000
It's hard to understand facial expressions.

173
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,456
It's simple and easy to understand.

174
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
It's easy to understand.

175
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,160
Oh, it's really hard.

176
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
This is a muscle.

177
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Wow!

178
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,130
Wow!

179
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,180
It's a little hard.

180
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:58,660
It's hard.

181
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Oh, my God!

182
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,460
Is this hair okay?

183
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,540
It's not good for your body.

184
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
You should take it out.

185
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,280
You should take it out.

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,660
It's heavy, isn't it?

187
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
How heavy is it?

188
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,260
Look, it's fine.

189
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,540
It's going to come out.

190
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
Really?

191
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,000
Already? It's amazing.

192
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,760


193
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Is it coming out?

194
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:23,841
Is it coming out?

195
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,480
What? Is it coming out?

196
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
It's coming out!

197
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,460
It's coming out!

198
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:53,760
It's coming out!

199
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,920
Why are you getting
embarrassed? I don't know.

200
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,240


201
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
It's coming out.

202
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,740
Wait, wait. It's still coming out.

203
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,350
Wow!

204
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:12,430
Isn't it great?

205
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
It's not that bad.

206
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
It's not that strong.

207
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,150
Isn't it great?

208
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,500
It smells like tea.

209
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,640
I think it's getting stronger.

210
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
Wow!

211
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,340
Why are you laughing?

212
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,900
It's really the best.

213
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
It's the best.

214
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,760
I heard it for the first time today.

215
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,060

Thank you for watching!
