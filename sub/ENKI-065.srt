1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm going to buy a new camera.

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,740
Hey, I've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,140
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,436
I've been waiting for you.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,460
What's this?

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,300
Oh, I know what this is.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,160
What's this?

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,740
I bought this.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,380
Did you buy a new one?

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Yeah.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,250
It's this small.

12
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:36,540
It's so small.

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,400
It's so small.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
It's already taken.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,920
How much can you take?

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,080
Do you want to see it?

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
I want to see it.

18
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,260
Wow, it's pretty good.

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,980
Wow!

20
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,180
It's like a vlog.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,040
What are we doing today?

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,980
Since we bought this,

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,940
we are going to take a walk.

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,820
A walk?

25
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,740
OK.

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,340
You look sexy today.

27
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,900
Don't I look cute today?

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
You look cute.

29
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,460
Can you see my shoulders?

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Yes.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,180
We are not going to take a walk.

32
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:17,580
It's like going to a club, isn't it?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's right.

34
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,300
I feel like a party person.

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,900
I feel like a party person.

36
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,340
Have you been playing recently?

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
I've been playing a lot recently.

38
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,990
What kind of play have
you been doing recently?

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,420
I drink at a club and play with everyone.

40
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm taking it home.

41
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
Taking it home.

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
It's the opposite.

43
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,800
My rank is going down.

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,380
Are you okay?

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,840
Because you didn't meet me.

46
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm busy.

47
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,340
Didn't you forget about me?

48
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,440
No, I didn't.

49
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,620
That's good.

50
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Let's go.

51
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Let's go.

52
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,210
Let's walk to the hotel.

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I see.

54
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,430
Do you want to do it?

55
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,080
I want to do it.

56
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
Just like this.

57
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,620
Just like this?

58
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Here?

59
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,540
Now?

60
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,541
Now?

61
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,295
Did you do anything good recently?

62
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:06,780
Anything interesting?

63
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:06,960
What do you mean?

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Something funny?

65
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,800
Something erotic?

66
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,840
Something like a romantic monster?

67
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,240
Do you do something about it?

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,200
I don't do anything about it.

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,160
On the other hand,

70
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,440
I don't come here often,

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,760
so I go from here.

72
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,361
I have a lot of space in
the strike zone, It's so big.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,740
I think it's okay for anyone.

74
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,160
I think it's tough if you don't
have a strong desire to win.

75
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,720
Even if I drink alcohol,
I feel like I'm full.

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
Do you still go to izakayas?

77
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,920
I go to izakayas.

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I drink a bottle of beer.

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,960
Don't you drink raw beer?

80
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:56,560
Why don't you drink beer?

81
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,400
I like beer, but I don't like fresh beer.

82
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,660
I like the freshness of beer.

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,440
You'll be thirsty when you're done.

84
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
I'll be thirsty.

85
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,260
Let's drink around here.

86
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I want to drink.

87
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,550
Are you okay?

88
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm okay.

89
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,326
Don't you need to go to the bathroom?

90
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,350
You peed, didn't you?

91
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,430
I want to do it.

92
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,090
Let me take it off.

93
00:04:15,380 --> 00:06:32,820
Do you want to put this in?

94
00:07:43,665 --> 00:10:24,780
Do it hard.

95
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,990
It's painful.

96
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,270
It's painful.

97
00:12:12,560 --> 00:13:49,240
That's all.

98
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,120
How do you feel?

99
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Strong.

100
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,420
Sweet.

101
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Look at her.

102
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,670
You look like a baby with a stomachache.

103
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,550
It's hard to walk, isn't it?

104
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
Are you okay?

105
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,410
It's better to walk normally.

106
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,250
Let's stop it once.

107
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:07,611
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

108
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,030
Did you stop?

109
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,350
Did you stop?

110
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,290
Do you hate this?

111
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,290
I don't hate it.

112
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,990
But I was nervous.

113
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,210
You look serious.

114
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,350
I thought you were relaxed.

115
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,450
No, I'm not relaxed at all.

116
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,250
Look at this.

117
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,530
It's cute.

118
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,010
There are a lot of people.

119
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,030
I can't.

120
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,710
No, no.

121
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,230
No.

122
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,890
You can go while people are watching.

123
00:15:49,550 --> 00:16:00,090
No, no.

124
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,030
Look, people are watching.

125
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,830
You can go.

126
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:05,591
You can say, Happy
Maru's crotch is full of vibes.

127
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,190
No, no.

128
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,530
Say it.

129
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,050
Say, my dog has vibes.

130
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,110
You can say that.

131
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,310
No.

132
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,330
You don't say it?

133
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,650
Show me your face.

134
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,651
Show me your face.

135
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,300
Why are you so naked?

136
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
It's hot.

137
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,560
What?

138
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm thirsty.

139
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,220
You're thirsty?

140
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,320
I told you to drink something.

141
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:18,320
What's wrong?

142
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:18,480
I see.

143
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Look up.

144
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,080
You were there, weren't you?

145
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm stuck.

146
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Can I stop you?

147
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,300
What?

148
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,160
Can I stop you?

149
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,640
No.

150
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Why?

151
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,800
Why are you behind me?

152
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
What's wrong?

153
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,480
Why are you behind me?

154
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm stuck behind you.

155
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
It's wet.

156
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,680
Is it wet?

157
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
It's wet.

158
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,340
Underpants?

159
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Yes.

160
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,820
I can't do it.

161
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,360
I can't do it.

162
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,361
I'll leave it.

163
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
I have to wash it properly.

164
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm desperate.

165
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm desperate.

166
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,440
Don't push me.

167
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
No.

168
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,280
I thought you would push me.

169
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:16,721
I thought you were going to bite me.

170
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,950
Don't bite me.

171
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:48,650
You are cute.

172
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,410
I took a good picture of you.

173
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:53,390
It's difficult.

174
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,010
Wait a minute.

175
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,530
I can't do this.

176
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,570
I can't do this.

177
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,790
Did it stop?

178
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,730
It stopped.

179
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,350
Didn't it stop?

180
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:10,470
Did it stop?

181
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,610
No?

182
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
What?

183
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,010
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

184
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:17,051
No, it stopped, didn't it?

185
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,990
No, it didn't.

186
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,470
Did it break?

187
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,870
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

188
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,570
It stopped.

189
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,310
Did it stop?

190
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,210
That's good.

191
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,211
It was good.

192
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,870
This is...

193
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,050
It's my own, isn't it?

194
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,890
I can't hear you.

195
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,390
Here we go.

196
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,630
You must be tired.

197
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,330
Yes, I am.

198
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
How was it today?

199
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,050
I was so nervous.

200
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Were you?

201
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,970
Yes, I was.

202
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,210
But...

203
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,610
I think there was something missing.

204
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,370
What was it?

205
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:38,371
What about you?

206
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:48,010
I had to be quiet, so I
couldn't do anything intense.

207
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,350
I wish I knew.

208
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,450
What?

209
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,930
It would be bad if someone came.

210
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,810
I'm relieved.

211
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,150
Let's do this.

212
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,530
I'm relieved.

213
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:04,730
It's done.

214
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,490
It's awesome.

215
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,610
I was surprised because
you took it out suddenly.

216
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,990
I was surprised.

217
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,440
You may be sweating a lot.

218
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,090
You're right.

219
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,510
I still have a little taste left.

220
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,510
Do you understand?

221
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,950
Yes.

222
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,750
You can finally make a sound.

223
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,330
I don't know why, but I feel like
I'm going to die if I keep doing this.

224
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:50,336
I don't know why, but I feel like
I'm going to die if I keep doing this.

225
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,850
I don't know why, but I feel like
I'm going to die if I keep doing this.

226
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,260
I don't know why, but I feel like
I'm going to die if I keep doing this.

227
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,280
I don't know why, but I feel like
I'm going to die if I keep doing this.

228
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,740
You are a good boy You are
a good boy Give me your paw.

229
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:50,541
Good boy Give me your paw You
are a good boy You are so clingy.

230
00:34:50,680 --> 00:35:02,240
You make a weird sound.

231
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,820
Happy Marunee-zuki is so good.

232
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,340
It's better than putting it in a manko.

233
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Really?

234
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,120
This is good enough.

235
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,150
No?

236
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,900
I don't want to.

237
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,940
Add some more.

238
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,821
Let me drink a lot That's right.

239
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
Oh, oh, oh.

240
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,270
It was painful, wasn't it?

241
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,830
You were terribly muddy, weren't you?

242
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,850
I was muddy, wasn't I?

243
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,910
Look, look,

244
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,990
Why don't you be my friend?

245
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,670
After this,

246
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,100
we will go to Sanpichi.

247
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:32,340
I want to do it.

248
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,400
You want to do it, right?

249
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,120
Let's call her.

251
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,470
She might be around.

252
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Really?

253
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,440

254
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,020

00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm still cold.

290
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,580
What am I doing now?

291
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,960

294
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
No.

00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,600
Bye-bye.

00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,460
Bye-bye.

297
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,700

Ah, it's so nice to be able
to sleep in my own bed.

303
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:25,360
Ah, I'm getting bigger and bigger.

Ah, it feels so good.

305
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,460
Awesome.

306
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,700
This is terrible.

307
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:58,701
I feel sick.

308
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,160
Wow.

309
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,160
It feels good.

310
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,680
It hurts.

311
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,520
Pant... pant... Pant...

312
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,960
Your waist won't stop, right?

313
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
It won't stop.

314
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
What?

315
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,020
Pant... pant...

316
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,140

317
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,660
Pant... pant... Pant...
Pant... It's uncomfortable.

318
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,680
I'll give you my hip pads.

319
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,660
Pant, pant, pant...
You can use them a lot.

320
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,660
You can use it a lot.

321
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,220
Can I use it a lot?

322
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Yes, you can.

323
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,630
You are scared, aren't you?

324
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:24,570
I'm sorry.

325
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:57,650
I feel so good.

326
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:12,450
I feel so good.

327
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,620
He is still in a bad mood

328
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,640
He was in a bad mood a while ago.

329
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,170
He is in a bad mood.

330
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,710
He is in a bad mood
He is in a good mood.

331
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,510
Is he your friend?

332
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:12,590
Really?

333
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,390
I think she's coming.

334
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:16,850
I think she's over there.

335
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,210
Really?

336
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,690
Should I call her?

337
00:47:24,055 --> 00:47:25,055
I'll call her.

338
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,450
I'll call her.

339
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,490
Just like this?

340
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,960
When is she coming?

341
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,860
She's coming.

342
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:41,861
Here you are.

343
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,320
Me?

344
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Go, go.

345
00:47:50,690 --> 00:48:04,070
Nice to meet you.

346
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,670
Nice to meet you.

347
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,550
This is my friend.

348
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:17,290
Say hello.

349
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,870
I want you to do a lot of things for me.

350
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,110
Can I do it?

351
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,470
Yes.

352
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Can I do it?

353
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,760
Yes, you can.

354
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,160
Can I?

355
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,380
I've been waiting for you.

356
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,460
I'm scared.

357
00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:05,510
I can't help you.

358
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,130
You smell like sweat.

359
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,070
You didn't think so, did you?

360
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,150
I love the smell of sweat.

361
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,130
I'm going to sleep.

362
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:43,131
You can do it.

363
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,950
I want to sleep.

364
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,490
Happy, you are the brother of the phone.

365
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,430
Oh, it's very intense.

366
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,190
Oh, it's close.

367
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,390
How did you feel when you heard the
voice on the phone and saw the video?

368
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,930
It was a little different.

369
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,650
What kind of image was it?

370
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,450
I thought he was a little kind.

371
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,900
I'm so sorry.

372
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:05,250
I'm so sorry.

373
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,700
I'm sorry.

374
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,640
I'm sorry.

375
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,480
I was excited because
you suddenly hit me hard.

376
00:52:45,800 --> 00:53:07,340
I'm so sorry.

377
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,300
I'm sorry.

378
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,700
You can't eat it.

379
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,270
Great.

380
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,510
Chin Chin.

381
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,500
Great.

382
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,660
Treasure found.

383
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,600
Wait.

384
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,980
What are you doing?

385
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,260
What are you doing?

386
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:48,900
Ouch!

387
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:49,901
Who said it's okay?

388
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,540
It's not okay.

389
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:54,800
Really?

390
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:56,940
No?

391
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,860
No.

392
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,100
No.

393
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,840
I told you no.

394
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:23,570
I'll use this.

395
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,550
You don't mind, do you?

396
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,670
Ouch...

397
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:55,940
Oh my god...

398
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:25,240
Good girl.

399
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,960
I feel good.

400
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,540
I feel like I've been in heaven.

401
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,040
I feel good.

402
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,150
I can't.

403
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,020
I can't.

404
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,700
I can't.

405
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:06,701
I can't.

406
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,260
I'm sleepy.

407
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:49,220
I'm sorry.

408
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,620
I feel so good.

409
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,171
I can't believe I'm doing this to you.

410
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,690
I'm doing this to you.

411
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:53,691
I feel good.

412
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,190
I feel good because I'm doing this to you.

413
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,430
It hurts.

414
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,070
What's wrong?

415
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,770
what's up?

416
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:31,930
What's up?

417
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,810
No, I'm fine.

418
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,460
Do you want me to stay this way?

419
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:26,120
You want me to stay like this, right?

420
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:30,820
Open your eyes wide and show me your face.

421
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,080
Do you want to sleep?

422
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,360
I want to sleep.

423
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,140
I told you to sleep.

424
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,370
Give me a kiss.

425
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:06,500
Hi hi Ah ah ah ah eh.

426
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:11,860
Ah yeah ah.

427
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:21,980
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Hahaha Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

428
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,340
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

429
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,920
Ah, it is not good.

430
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:30,921
No!

431
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,420
I'm going!

432
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,160
I'm going!

433
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
I'm going!

434
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,860
Good boy.

435
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:32,260
You are a good boy.

436
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:33,261
You are a good boy.

437
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,680
Happy, look at the camera.

438
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,340
What are you doing?

439
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Tell me.

440
01:03:01,465 --> 01:03:04,080
What are you doing in
the middle of the night?

441
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,140
I'm taking a shinko.

442
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,120
What kind of shinko?

443
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,700
Shinko.

444
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,980
Whose shinko?

445
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,180
My friend's shinko.

446
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,820
Oh, your friend's shinko.

447
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,520
Is it your first time seeing him today?

448
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,300
Yes, it is.

449
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,880
How do you feel?

450
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,780
I feel good.

451
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,560
I'm sorry.

452
01:03:48,315 --> 01:03:55,790
I'm sorry.

453
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:59,770
I'm sorry.

454
01:03:59,771 --> 01:04:00,771
I'm sorry.

455
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:07,930
I can't do it.

456
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,370
I can't do it.

457
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:29,910
I can't do it.

458
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,690
I'm not feeling good.

459
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,750
I'm not feeling good.

460
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,130
I'm not feeling good.

461
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,430
I'm not feeling good.

462
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:24,210
It hurts! It hurts!

463
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:33,600
It hurts! It hurts!

464
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:41,640
I'm a little tired, so let's go to bed.

465
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
Where am I?

466
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:40,320
I'm not going to do it.

467
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,920
I'm going to do it.

468
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,920
You can use it right away, right?

469
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,600
Yes.

470
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,820
Oh!

471
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,820
Oh!

472
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:04,780
Oh!

473
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,520
Oh!

474
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,180
Oh!

475
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,320
Oh!

476
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,540
Yes.

477
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,360
It's not wet.

478
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,440
No.

479
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,180
Are you sure?

480
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,380
Yes.

481
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:16,970
Wow.

482
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,200
I'm going to put your favorite
chimpanzee in your mouth.

483
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,236
You have to clean your mouth like this.

484
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,260
Yes.

485
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,840
You have to stand up straight.

486
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,620
Does it feel good?

487
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,741
You have to stand up straight.

488
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,380
Yes.

489
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,951
If you do it properly, you can
put the chimpanzee in your mouth.

490
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,670
I understand.

491
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:55,270
I'm going to sleep.

492
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:02,030
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

493
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:24,340
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

494
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:31,230
I'm going to put the
medicine, so be careful.

495
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,820
Don't cry.

496
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:21,600
Don't cry.

497
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,460
I'm going home.

498
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,640
I'm sorry.

499
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,680
Don't cry.

500
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:22,756
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

501
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,110
I'm going to sleep.

502
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:35,130
I'm going to sleep.

503
01:13:35,131 --> 01:13:36,131
What's wrong?

504
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,570
I'm going to sleep.

505
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,270
What's wrong?

506
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:17,530
What do you want to do?

507
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:19,370
You're saying it's okay to say it?

508
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:20,611
You're going to leave it to me?

509
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,310
Let's just say it.

510
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,490
I'm sorry.

511
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,050
I'm sorry.

512
01:14:34,051 --> 01:14:34,830
I'm sorry.

513
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:35,850
She is crying.

514
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:37,650
I'm sorry.

515
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,840
I'm going to sleep.

516
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,380
I'm going to sleep.

517
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,080
I put the bed in the back.

518
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,220
Great.

519
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,200
Good boy.

520
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,060
You are a good boy.

521
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:49,140
Good boy.

522
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:50,560
Good boy.

523
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:51,160
Good boy.

524
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,100
Good boy.

525
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:00,830
Good boy.

526
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,570
This is the best!

527
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,030
This is the best!

528
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:25,210
Why am I so happy!

529
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,270
Wow!

530
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:10,570
You have a pimple again.

531
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:12,770
You are fluttering!

532
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:18,560
Here we go!

533
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:29,140
You are great!

534
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:41,301
You're a good boy, my friend.

535
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:44,700
You've got a lot of hair.

536
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,920
I was surprised.

537
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:48,780
Were you surprised?

538
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,460
I had a lot of hair, too.

539
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:00,980
You were happy, weren't you?

540
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,820
I was very happy.

541
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,680
That's good.

542
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,921
You don't have enough hair, do you?

543
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,360
Did you take it off?

544
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,020
No.

545
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,780
Are you going to break up with me today?

546
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,320
No.

547
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:22,620
Are you sure?

548
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,320
You said you wanted to play with me.

549
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,220
Yes, I did.

550
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,140
Then, will you come with me?

551
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Really?

552
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,481
You are free today, aren't you?

553
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,340
Yes, I am.

554
01:18:38,341 --> 01:18:39,341
Yes, I will.

555
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,220
Then, I will gather a lot of people.

556
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,900
What?

557
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,380
OK, I will follow you.

558
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,480
OK, follow me.

559
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:51,280
Don't stay there. Let's go.

560
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:52,880
Already?

561
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,180
Let's go.

562
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:55,420
I don't have time.

563
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,360
I can't.

564
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
You can't.

565
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,320
Stand up.

566
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,440
I can't.

567
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:00,900
I will leave you here.

568
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,280
No way.

569
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,410
I can't.

570
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,900
Nyan, nyan.

571
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,200
It's cute.

572
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Nyan, nyan.

573
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:32,940
Is it a cat?

574
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,880
Hyo?

575
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,340
It's a cat like Hyo.

576
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,020
Mehyo?

577
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,120
Mehyo.

578
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,201
I thought it would be happy.

579
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,860
Who would be happy?

580
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,521
A lot of people will
come after this, right?

581
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:50,780
A lot of people.

582
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,161
How many people will come?

583
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:55,740
Do you care about that?

584
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,800
Of course I do.

585
01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:59,131
Do you care about the number?

586
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:00,680
Yes, I do. How many?

587
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:07,600
So far, I've got 4 or 5 replies.

588
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,840
What?

589
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:11,940
What do you mean?

590
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:14,770
I want a little more.

591
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,360
That's a luxury.

592
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:17,361
That's right.

593
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,240
I want 7 or 8 more.

594
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,030
What did you say?

595
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,260
I want 7 or 8 more.

596
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,921
You are a luxurious woman.

597
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,080
I want more.

598
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,540
You want more?

599
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:33,990
OK.

600
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,100
I'll call you a little more.

601
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,981
You can take a break until they come.

602
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:42,480
Take a break?

603
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,020
Even though I changed my clothes?

604
01:20:45,021 --> 01:20:46,900
It'll take about an hour.

605
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,000
It's itching.

606
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:50,980
It's itching?

607
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,340
It's itching.

608
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:57,650
It's itching.

609
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:58,210
It's itching.

610
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,440
What should we do?

611
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:00,390
What should we do with Nabu?

612
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:01,690
What should we do?

613
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:03,611
How about a warm-up exercise?

614
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:05,831
How about a warm-up exercise with Manko?

615
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,290
A warm-up exercise.

616
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,690
Do you want to do it normally?

617
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:10,090
Yes.

618
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,230
So that many men can accept it.

619
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:12,990
Yes.

620
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:14,430
Let's do a warm-up exercise.

621
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:15,671
Let's take a look at your face.

622
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,710
You have a cute face.

623
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,520
It's embarrassing.

624
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,021
Do you know what kind of face you have?

625
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,310
I don't know.

626
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:10,090
You have a cute face.

627
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:12,630
Do you want to see your face?

628
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:14,330
Do you want to see your face?

629
01:22:14,331 --> 01:22:15,331
Do you want to see it?

630
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:18,250
It's cute, isn't it?

631
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,090
No, it's not cute at all.

632
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,110
Look at it properly.

633
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,190
I don't want to.

634
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:32,330
I saw it.

635
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:35,030
It's cute, isn't it?

636
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,030
It's leaking, isn't it?

637
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:38,470
It's leaking.

638
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:40,530
It's not leaking.

639
01:22:40,531 --> 01:22:41,531
I can't take it off.

640
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:46,790
Can you take it off?

641
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,460
What is this?

642
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,200
It's very vibrating, isn't it?

643
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,260
Amazing.

644
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:30,740
What's that?

645
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,680
It's a dentist!

646
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,240
Look at the camera.

647
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:55,720
It's leaking.

648
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,250
No, it's not.

649
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,580
Let me clean your nose.

650
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:22,400
My nose is itchy
It's itchy, isn't it?

651
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:26,930
It's itchy.

652
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,000
It's itchy.

653
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,140
It hurts.

654
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,620
Ouch!

655
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:01,490
Ouch!

656
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,630
Ouch!

657
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,450
Ouch!

658
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:39,470
It's time to go to the vet.

659
01:25:39,471 --> 01:25:39,750
Do you feel good?

660
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:40,990
You should feel good.

661
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,810
Don't go to the vet without permission.

662
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:45,771
You can't go to the vet without permission.

663
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,670
It's getting harder.

664
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:54,370
He's purring.

665
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,061
Do you feel the difference
between right and left?

666
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:10,550
I want to go to the left.

667
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,710
Left? This way?

668
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:13,930
I want to go to the left.

669
01:26:13,931 --> 01:26:14,931
It's not a big deal.

670
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,470
I want to go to the left.

671
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:17,780
It feels so good.

672
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,190
Which way?

673
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:26,710
This way?

674
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:29,780
Right?

675
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:32,270
Right?

676
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,271
This way?

677
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,880
Ouch!

678
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,400
I'm going to turn it over.

679
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,420
I have a bad feeling about this.

680
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:54,660
I'm sorry.

681
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:02,940
You are wet.

682
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:39,380
You are naughty.

683
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,220
You are wet.

684
01:32:57,790 --> 01:32:58,970
What are you going to do? You are wet.

685
01:32:58,971 --> 01:33:01,010
Let me see.

686
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:04,690
Let me see your belly.

687
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:06,690
Let's put this in.

688
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,270
It's leaking.

689
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:30,210
Don't let it leak.

690
01:33:30,211 --> 01:33:34,850
Good boy.

691
01:33:36,655 --> 01:33:42,410
Good boy.

692
01:33:42,411 --> 01:33:43,411
Good boy.

693
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:28,050
I'm glad you are in good health.

694
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:32,830
I also wish you good health from now on.

695
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,280
I'm glad I made your wish.

696
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:47,760
Today's dinner is a cold Ume-soba.

697
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:56,970
I'm going to put the switch on.

698
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,950
I'm going to put the switch on.

699
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:03,050
I can't hear you.

700
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:06,670
I'm going to put the switch on.

701
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:24,170
You are very excited.

702
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:27,010
You are very excited.

703
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:29,060
It's dangerous, so don't do it on your own.

704
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,900
I'll pull it out slowly.

705
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:13,700
I'll pull it out harder.

706
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:59,550
Oh my gosh!

707
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:41,720
Are you OK?

708
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:47,420
You're sweating a lot.

709
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:50,480
What's this?

710
01:40:50,481 --> 01:40:51,481
What's that?

711
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Sweat?

712
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:56,740
Salt?

713
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:57,680
Salt?

714
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:58,860
Is salt this much?

715
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,880
It's too much.

716
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,061
Don't make my house dirty.

717
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,500
Please don't.

718
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:38,780
Yay.

719
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,140
Yay.

720
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,990
It's cute. Stand up.

721
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:45,720
It's cute, isn't it?

722
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:46,740
It's cute, isn't it?

723
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,160
It's a modern JK.

724
01:41:49,161 --> 01:41:50,161
I don't like it.

725
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,320
Can you sit like this?

726
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,240
Can you do it?

727
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,500
Yes, I can.

728
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:56,740
Look at this.

729
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:09,810
It looks good on you.

730
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:15,310
You look like you are in
front of a convenience store.

731
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,430
Tamuro?

732
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,590
Yes, Tamuro.

733
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,890
There are many gyaru like you.

734
01:42:23,891 --> 01:42:24,891
Really?

735
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:29,891
By the way, what are you doing?

736
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,060
Are you waiting for someone?

737
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:37,380
Didn't you call me?

738
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:40,760
I was waiting for you.

739
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:41,600
You were waiting for me?

740
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,280
Yes, I did.

741
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:43,500
I stretched my legs.

742
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,040
Are you ready?

743
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:47,740
Yes.

744
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:48,960
Did you call me?

745
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:51,750
Yes, I did.

746
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,180
Why are you so excited?

747
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,220
I called you.

748
01:42:57,310 --> 01:43:00,140
I called you because you said
there were not many people.

749
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:03,920
I called you because you said
there were not many people.

750
01:43:03,921 --> 01:43:04,921
I did it!

751
01:43:05,745 --> 01:43:07,260
I think you did a good job.

752
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:08,750
Play with me.

753
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,660
Call me.

754
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,860
I'm here.

755
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,240
What should I call you?

756
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:17,040
How about come on?

757
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,800
Welcome.

758
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,080
I'm in trouble.

759
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,140
What do you mean?

760
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,200
How about come on?

761
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,120
You want to be here, don't you?

762
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:27,820
You don't mind, do you?

763
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,520
How about come in?

764
01:43:29,521 --> 01:43:32,240
Can you say something like, please come in?

765
01:43:32,241 --> 01:43:33,241
Yes, I can.

766
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,480
Please come in.

767
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:44,740
Can you say something like, please come in.

768
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:49,000
Please come in.

769
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:01,590
There are so many.

770
01:44:01,591 --> 01:44:02,591
Here you are.

771
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:12,090
Thank you so much.

772
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,270
I called you as you requested.

773
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:17,950
Look around you.

774
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:20,430
It's amazing.

775
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,730
Everything is solid.

776
01:44:23,755 --> 01:44:24,955
It's getting better, isn't it?

777
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:26,550
Yes, it is.

778
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:31,610
Why don't we listen to what
they have to say and move on?

779
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:33,310
What?

780
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:36,170
They are kind. They are my friends.

781
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:36,950
Friends?

782
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:38,470
That's right.

783
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,830
Let's talk. I can't look at you.

784
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:44,870
Hello.

785
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:46,330
Hello.

786
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:47,410
Hello.

787
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,710
I want you to touch him.

788
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:51,950
He has a lot of dung.

789
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:55,130
Dung.

790
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:57,440
What's wrong with him?

791
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:00,990
I want to put him in.

792
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:03,930
What's wrong with him?

793
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:05,490
I want to put him in.

794
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,081
Where do you want to put him?

795
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:10,430
I want to put him in Manko.

796
01:45:10,431 --> 01:45:12,130
I want to put it here.

797
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:15,070
You are good at it.

798
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:23,010
Let's take a look.

799
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:25,370
Let's take a look at your ears.

800
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:38,050
Touch it.

801
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,130
I'm so happy.

802
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:49,870
Are you happy?

803
01:45:52,570 --> 01:45:54,586
You've never been surrounded
like this before, have you?

804
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:55,610
No, I haven't.

805
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:56,830
Let's get started.

806
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,410
Can I touch you?

807
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:10,370
It feels good.

808
01:46:10,371 --> 01:46:11,371
Good boy.

809
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,090
How is it?

810
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:26,710
Please observe him.

811
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:31,770
He is big.

812
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:55,540
He has a small mouth.

813
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:56,541
You're so small.

814
01:47:05,805 --> 01:47:06,805
You're so big.

815
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:10,260
Everyone is big.

816
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,040
I like big ones.

817
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:17,160
I think it'll feel good if
you put this in a manko.

818
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,240
It looks good.

819
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:23,151
You want me to put it in a manko, right?

820
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,060
I have to tell everyone.

821
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:28,720
Put it in a manko.

822
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:47,110
Next.

823
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:57,750
Do you want to put in this little one?

824
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:00,450
I want to put it in.

825
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,150
What should I do?

826
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:10,690
How about this one?

827
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:18,890
The line is made Great I
want to put in this little one.

828
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:34,620
I want to put all the mangoes in it.

829
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:39,780
Everyone is big, isn't it?

830
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:41,750
Everyone is big.

831
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,080
I'm going to eat it.

832
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:50,190
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

833
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:59,410
Don't take a break.

834
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:09,470
You have a nice face.

835
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:11,050
You eat a lot.

836
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:12,051
Look at the back.

837
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:17,190
How is it?

838
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:20,830
Do you want to open it?

839
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:31,520
Look at the back.

840
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:35,600
It's so tight I'm scared.

841
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,920
Where should I put it?

842
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,860
Tell your brother where you want to put it

843
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:46,120
I think he'll put it in for you I
want you to put it in the mango.

844
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,140
The mango?

845
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:54,720
We like mangoes, but we also like
to put it in the back of our throats.

846
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Really?

847
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:06,160
I'll put a lot of mangoes
in the back of our throats.

848
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,040
Really?

849
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:09,180
I'll make you do it.

850
01:50:09,335 --> 01:50:10,580
I'll do my best.

851
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,160
Really?

852
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:12,480
Yes.

853
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:13,640
I'll do my best.

854
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:50,770
Good boy.

855
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:19,280
He's scratching his head.

856
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:25,610
What is this?

857
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,120
No, no, no.

858
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:29,580
What did you eat?

859
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,200
I'm embarrassed.

860
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:37,031
You're embarrassed, but you're eating it.

861
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,480
I'm embarrassed.

862
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:40,660
Don't you need Chinchin?

863
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,320
You don't need Chinchin?

864
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,180
Don't you need Chinchin?

865
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:47,720
I want it.

866
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:51,880
I'll do it for you as much as I put in.

867
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:30,570
Good boy.

868
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,561
Oh, he's gone He's gone.

869
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,640
Don't try so hard by yourself.

870
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:36,720
You're not coming in at all.

871
01:53:36,721 --> 01:53:37,440
Wow, that's amazing.

872
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:38,740
You've come this far.

873
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:43,640
You're not coming in at all.

874
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:49,580
You're not coming in at all.

875
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:51,580
Oh, you're out again.

876
01:53:57,755 --> 01:53:58,860
You're not coming in at all.

877
01:53:58,861 --> 01:54:00,340
There's nothing in there.

878
01:54:00,341 --> 01:54:01,536
I told you to put it in the box.

879
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:02,560
There's nothing in there.

880
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,200
Wow.

881
01:54:16,055 --> 01:54:19,940
There's a lot of water.

882
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:21,680
There's a lot of water on the futon.

883
01:54:21,681 --> 01:54:23,160
You've got something on your face.

884
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:26,600
Get out of the futon.

885
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,440
It's amazing.

886
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:31,340
Do you smell?

887
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,240
Do you smell?

888
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:35,560
What did you eat?

889
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:40,380
I'm tired of waiting.

890
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:42,880
Make it big.

891
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:54,700
You want to put it in, don't you?

892
01:54:54,701 --> 01:55:02,800
Manko, you don't have to go that far.

893
01:55:05,465 --> 01:55:07,386
You want me to put it
all the way in, don't you?

894
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:24,190
It won't stop. It's all wet.

895
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:25,550
See?

896
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:30,770
Your uniform is all wet.

897
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:49,000
You don't drink it, do you?

898
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:32,411
I think I'm going to throw up.

899
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:39,370
Oh, my God.

900
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:18,980
I'm going to throw up.

901
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:21,900
You're drooling a lot.

902
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:22,000
Good boy.

903
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:38,080
I'm sorry.

904
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:25,310
You are strong.

905
02:02:25,905 --> 02:02:27,190
Is it painful?

906
02:02:29,490 --> 02:02:30,110
How is it?

907
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:31,630
It's painful.

908
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:35,490
What's wrong?

909
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:39,730
I'll put you on the other side.

910
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:52,370
Look at me.

911
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:02,720
Look at me.

912
02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:07,530
Look at the camera.

913
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:37,740
You can do it!

914
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,660
You can do it!

915
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:30,600
I'm going to have a hard time.

916
02:04:30,601 --> 02:04:31,601
I feel sick.

917
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,580
I'm going to have a hard time.

918
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:35,006
I'm going to have a hard time.

919
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:36,560
Can I take out a lot of this?

920
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:39,940
I feel like I'm going to die.

921
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:53,310
I feel like I'm going to die.

922
02:04:58,540 --> 02:04:59,950
Don't drink it on your own.

923
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,430
Show me your mouth.

924
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:05,470
Open your big mouth.

925
02:05:08,170 --> 02:05:09,210
Show me your small eyes.

926
02:05:12,230 --> 02:05:13,230
Do you have a little bit?

927
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:15,950
You have a little bit.

928
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:17,130
It's not a big deal.

929
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:18,430
You've been eating for about a week.

930
02:05:18,431 --> 02:05:19,431
How much did you eat?

931
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:22,641
I dropped it on the floor.

932
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:26,371
Did you drop it on the floor?

933
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:27,700
What are you doing?

934
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:29,690
You can't do that.

935
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:31,791
I didn't tell you to drink it.

936
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:33,420
I'm sorry.

937
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:34,690
Don't drink it next time.

938
02:06:47,425 --> 02:06:49,820
It's hot.

939
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:53,640
Here you are.

940
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:02,850
Oh, it's hot.

941
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:04,280
Here he comes.

942
02:08:18,365 --> 02:08:23,160
Here he comes.

943
02:08:23,161 --> 02:08:24,161
You did it.

944
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:25,380
You did it.

945
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:26,600
Suck it.

946
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:56,110
You can do it.

947
02:08:56,111 --> 02:08:57,111
That's right.

948
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:03,320
I'll give you some poison.

949
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:10,780
It's coming out.

950
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:16,740
That's right.

951
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:19,140
It's coming out.

952
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,540
Don't run away.

953
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:33,960
Let's put it in your mouth.

954
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,640
It's still coming out.

955
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:40,300
It's still coming out.

956
02:09:54,090 --> 02:10:03,960
Show me what's in your mouth.

957
02:10:03,961 --> 02:10:05,060
Show me your face.

958
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:11,200
This is a sperm, isn't it?

959
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:12,920
Around your mouth.

960
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,060
You have to take it.

961
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,400
You can't let go of it.

962
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:25,380
Gather all the sperm.

963
02:10:34,605 --> 02:10:35,605
Taste it.

964
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:42,130
How does it taste?

965
02:10:46,185 --> 02:10:47,730
It's good.

966
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,540
It's good? That's good.

967
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:51,330
There's still more.

968
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:57,310
You can't do that.

969
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:58,870
You'll get angry if you do that.

970
02:10:59,790 --> 02:11:00,410
You can't move, can you?

971
02:11:00,411 --> 02:11:12,110
I'll make it impossible for you to move.

972
02:11:12,111 --> 02:11:16,180
I'll make it impossible for you to move.

973
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:22,380
You can't move, can you?

974
02:11:33,940 --> 02:11:37,220
OK?

975
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,960
You can't move?

976
02:11:52,160 --> 02:12:00,840
You can't move either.

977
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:09,140
You can't drink it all.

978
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:14,880
Look at me, Pimma.

979
02:12:15,005 --> 02:12:16,260
Look at the camera.

980
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:28,420
You're not going to eat it?

981
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:39,630
You're not going to eat it?

982

Oh, it's creepy.

986
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:53,640
What is this place?

987
02:14:58,060 --> 02:14:59,580
Oh, I'm going to get in.

988
02:15:21,005 --> 02:15:26,540
I'm still going to put it in.

989
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:28,740
You shouldn't complain.

990
02:15:31,675 --> 02:15:32,675
Look at me.

991
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:35,531

It's good that you're
looking the other way.

999
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:28,490
There's a little bit left.

1000

Taste it and drink it.

1001

You can do it if you don't rampage.

02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:06,550
I'll take it off for you.

1009
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:08,690
Just don't rampage.

Let's see.

1027

That's true.

1028
02:22:10,641 --> 02:22:12,401
I'm sorry, I don't
understand the situation.

1029

02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:41,540
Put it here.

1036
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,680
You're going in there.

1037
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:12,040
How do you feel now?

1038
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:16,740
You feel good now, don't you?

1039
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:21,720
I'm listening.

1040
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:24,680
I feel good.

1041
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:25,840
Let me hold you.

1042
02:24:25,841 --> 02:24:31,700
Then I'll make you feel better.

1043
02:24:57,210 --> 02:25:02,290
Do you understand?

1044
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:08,560
Do you understand?

1045
02:25:08,561 --> 02:25:09,561
Do you want to eat?

1046
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:11,510
I'll give it to you now.

1047
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:15,470
If you do your best,
I'll give it to you later.

1048
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,780
Here we go.

1049
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:20,620
One, two.

1050
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:48,140
You have a lot of fur.

1051
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:52,700
You have a lot of fur.

1052
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,360
Are you okay?

1053
02:26:20,361 --> 02:26:22,300
You have a runny nose and a cough.

1054
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:28,940
You shouldn't have sneezed.

1055
02:26:33,430 --> 02:26:36,850
I'm sorry.

1056
02:26:38,450 --> 02:26:40,190
Did you say, you're sorry?

1057
02:26:40,191 --> 02:26:41,191
Where did you go?

1058
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:46,530
What are you doing?

1059
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:50,610
It's not over yet.

1060
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:52,880
Are you still there?

1061
02:26:54,810 --> 02:26:56,490
Why are you lying on the bed?

1062
02:26:59,370 --> 02:27:00,570
You're lying on the bed.

1063
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:05,720
Raise your butt.

1064
02:29:01,195 --> 02:29:02,315
Look at your brother's face.

1065
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:06,190
Look at your brother's face.

1066
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:10,940
You're a human, aren't you?

1067
02:30:17,890 --> 02:30:22,270
It's a strange behavior.

1068
02:30:22,470 --> 02:30:25,550
I don't know what it is.

1069
02:30:25,551 --> 02:30:25,750
He's drooling.

1070
02:30:25,751 --> 02:30:26,751
I don't know what it is.

1071
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:48,830
Good boy.

1072
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,080
Do you feel good?

1073
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,990
Look at you, Ochinchi.

1074
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:18,360
Is it long?

1075
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:19,580
It's big, right?

1076
02:31:46,030 --> 02:31:50,720
I can't stop drinking.

1077
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,420
I can't stop drinking.

1078
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:11,900
I can't stop drinking.

1079
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:24,200
It's not over yet.

1080
02:32:47,650 --> 02:32:49,050
It's not over yet.

1081
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:34,860
Look at his face.

1082
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:37,770
Look at his face.

1083
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:39,900
What do you want?

1084
02:33:48,250 --> 02:33:49,260
What do you want?

1085
02:33:55,100 --> 02:33:56,100
What do you want?

1086
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,710
You feel good, don't you?

1087
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:03,670
Chinchin Chinchin,
you feel good, don't you?

1088
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:29,500
You feel good, don't you?

1089
02:34:35,460 --> 02:34:36,460
I'll play with you.

1090
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:26,930
He is still in pain.

1091
02:35:40,810 --> 02:35:42,640
Show me your mouth.

1092
02:35:48,330 --> 02:35:49,330
Did you drink it all?

1093
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:52,820
You didn't drink it all, did you?

1094
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,850
Puff, puff!

1095
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:55,420
Puff, puff!

1096
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:57,500
Puff, puff!

1097
02:39:02,050 --> 02:39:03,050
Why are you coughing?

1098
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:04,500
Get it under control.

1099
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:06,160
Cough!

1100
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:33,400
Here we go.

1101
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:35,700
Cough!

1102
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:37,660
Cough!

1103
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:54,520
Cough!

1104
02:39:55,860 --> 02:40:00,390
Alice also seems to be a little better

1105
02:40:00,690 --> 02:40:19,330
Did you finish?

1106
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:23,660
Have you finished eating?

1107
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:31,260
Have you finished eating?

1108
02:41:00,510 --> 02:41:37,490
I'm glad you put it in the manko.

1109
02:41:48,430 --> 02:41:49,740
It was good, wasn't it?

1110
02:41:53,810 --> 02:41:55,870
Manko is a throat manko, though.

1111
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:22,840
It was a man.

1112
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:27,240
I'm a serious gay.

1113
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:28,290
Really?

1114
02:42:28,580 --> 02:42:29,940
If you notice it, you'll be a fan.

1115
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:31,540
I'm glad you're a fan.

1116
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:35,060
Can I look inside?

1117
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:35,680
Yes.

1118
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,300
How old were you when you
saw your boobs for the first time?

1119
02:42:38,301 --> 02:42:39,660
I haven't seen my boobs.

1120
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:46,680
I don't think I'm interested in freeing.

1121
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,320
I'm not interested in freeing.

1122
02:42:48,321 --> 02:42:48,360
Are you?

1123
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:49,780
I'm not interested in people.

1124
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:53,860
What kind of people
are you not interested in?

1125
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:57,720
For example, when I was
a student, I was a teacher.

1126
02:42:58,500 --> 02:43:01,160
Oh, I see.

1127
02:43:01,161 --> 02:43:01,540
So that's what happened.

1128
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:02,240
Yes.

1129
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:03,540
You didn't actually do it.

1130
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:05,220
You were a teacher
and... Teacher.

1131
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:06,880
And... You were a class teacher.

1132
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:08,660
I was a class teacher.

1133
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:09,800
That's dangerous.

1134
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,620
Did you go to the
classroom with your teacher?

1135
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:15,640
Yes, I did.

1136
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:16,860
What?

1137
02:43:17,630 --> 02:43:19,700
You didn't go to the gym, did you?

1138
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:22,400
No, I didn't have a gym.

1139
02:43:22,401 --> 02:43:23,576
I didn't have time to do that.

1140
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:25,760
There is a mat in the gym,
so you can use it as a bed.

1141
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:26,920
Oh, I see.

1142
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:28,080
Are you experienced?

1143
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:29,920
No, I'm just delusional.

1144
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:31,400
What did you do just now?

1145
02:43:32,150 --> 02:43:33,520
What is it?

1146
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:38,200
Didn't you go to the bathroom
when you woke up drunk?

1147
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:41,440
I do that every day.

1148
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:42,680
Every day?

1149
02:43:42,740 --> 02:43:44,140
I have sex every day.

1150
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:45,920
Really?

1151
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:47,720
Do you have a lot of sexual intercourse?

1152
02:43:47,960 --> 02:43:49,360
I have a lot of sexual intercourse.

1153
02:43:49,580 --> 02:43:50,860
I have sex with five people now.

1154
02:43:50,861 --> 02:43:54,620
It's hard for 5 people to fly
a robot every day, isn't it?

1155
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,160
Yes, that's right.

1156
02:43:57,260 --> 02:43:58,860
What's this?

1157
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:00,880
What's this?

1158
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:02,600
What's this?

1159
02:44:02,601 --> 02:44:03,601
This is the police.

1160
02:44:03,700 --> 02:44:04,940
I'm going to arrest you.

1161
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:06,480
I'm going to arrest you.

1162
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:08,060
I'm going to arrest you.

1163
02:44:08,061 --> 02:44:09,600
I'm going to arrest you.

1164
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:13,400
The police are behind us.

1165
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:14,460
The police are behind us.

1166
02:44:20,125 --> 02:44:20,820
The police are behind us.

1167
02:44:20,821 --> 02:44:21,821
I don't like this part.

1168
02:44:22,860 --> 02:44:23,860
I don't like this part.

1169
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:25,640
Oh, no.

1170
02:44:25,641 --> 02:44:26,641
I'm tired of it.

1171
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:30,180
I want to adjust this part.

1172
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,920
Let's adjust this part.

1173
02:44:34,170 --> 02:44:35,240
Let's adjust this part.

1174
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:36,540
Let's adjust this part.

1175
02:44:36,541 --> 02:44:37,541
I can't find the balance.

1176
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:38,600
Please adjust this part.

1177
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:40,660
I'll adjust this part.

1178
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:42,900
I'll adjust this part.

1179
02:44:43,540 --> 02:44:44,540
Is this OK?

1180
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,760
I think this is not good.

1181
02:44:46,761 --> 02:44:47,761
Isn't it great?

1182
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:50,980
It's so smooth.

1183
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:53,160
It's not coming in, but it's okay.

1184
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:56,480
It's hard, so you can take it off.

1185
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:03,180
I'll give you a little.

1186
02:45:06,280 --> 02:45:08,600
It's embarrassing.

1187
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:17,760
Yeah.

1188
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Here you are, my baby.

1189
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:28,360
She's doing great.

1190
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:30,470
The inside of her mouth is warm.

1191
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:36,480
Can I lick this?

1192
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:45,549
It's been a long time since I had a baby,
so I was worried that I wouldn't be able to

1193
02:45:45,561 --> 02:45:47,756
eat well, but I was able to eat a lot of
delicious food because I had a baby in my arms.

1194
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:52,040
I'm so happy that I can eat
delicious food with my baby.

1195
02:45:54,030 --> 02:45:55,416
I'm so happy that I can eat
delicious food with my baby.

1196
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:58,480
Mom, I'm hungry.

1197
02:45:58,481 --> 02:46:00,100
Okay, okay.

1198
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:04,140
Are you hungry?

1199
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:05,460
I'm hungry.

1200
02:46:05,461 --> 02:46:07,360
You should lick the other part of the head.

1201
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:08,840
Look.

1202
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:10,040
I'm hungry.

1203
02:46:10,060 --> 02:46:17,580
It's a butt.

1204
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:19,480
It's a butt.

1205
02:46:19,481 --> 02:46:19,700
You like it?

1206
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:21,340
Yes, I do.

1207
02:46:23,635 --> 02:46:25,520
It's embarrassing.

1208
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:30,280
Give me a kiss.

1209
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:48,200
Do you want me to drink it?

1210
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:50,340
Do you want to drink it?

1211
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:51,580
I'll drink it.

1212
02:46:51,581 --> 02:46:52,581
It's good, isn't it?

1213
02:46:55,270 --> 02:46:57,320
If you want to drink
beer, there is a better way.

1214
02:46:58,980 --> 02:46:59,980
If you pour it here.

1215
02:47:02,565 --> 02:47:03,565
Pour it here?

1216
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:04,860
Yes.

1217
02:47:05,220 --> 02:47:06,220
Oh, it's very hard.

1218
02:47:11,730 --> 02:47:12,730
Is this a hindrance?

1219
02:47:16,770 --> 02:47:18,580
Is this better?

1220
02:47:18,581 --> 02:47:19,581
Do you like it?

1221
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:20,700
Do you want more beer?

1222
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:22,820
No, this is enough.

1223
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:33,940
The cat was slimy.

1224
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:36,400
Sorry, sir.

1225
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,560
I'll take this one.

1226
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:42,400
I'll take this one.

1227
02:47:42,401 --> 02:47:43,800
You have to put it in your mouth.

1228
02:47:43,801 --> 02:47:45,300
Put it in your mouth.

1229
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:46,940
Put it in your mouth.

1230
02:47:53,160 --> 02:48:00,380
You eat a lot.

1231
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:03,320
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

1232
02:48:06,600 --> 02:48:08,440
Do you want me to lick you more?

1233
02:48:18,190 --> 02:48:19,220
You are so heavy.

1234
02:48:19,580 --> 02:48:20,580
Let's put you to rest.

1235
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:22,841
It's so heavy... It's as
heavy as you are in milk.

1236
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:24,820
You might fall down.

1237
02:48:26,530 --> 02:48:30,400
Wow... Your tail
is not helping you.

1238
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:32,940
Look.

1239
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:42,800
Let's put you to rest.

1240
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:44,800
You need to kiss me.

1241
02:48:51,970 --> 02:48:53,630
Can I put it in my mouth?

1242
02:48:54,450 --> 02:48:55,450
Can I?

1243
02:48:55,970 --> 02:48:56,970
Yes.

1244
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:57,850
Can I?

1245
02:48:58,190 --> 02:48:58,530
Yes.

1246
02:48:59,170 --> 02:49:00,170
Wow.

1247
02:49:02,450 --> 02:49:03,450
Wow.

1248
02:49:03,550 --> 02:49:03,650
Wow.

1249
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:04,700
Can you see it?

1250
02:49:07,190 --> 02:49:08,190
Wow.

1251
02:49:09,190 --> 02:49:09,870
Wow.

1252
02:49:10,150 --> 02:49:11,150
Wow.

1253
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:12,260
Wow.

1254
02:49:13,150 --> 02:49:13,410
Wow.

1255
02:49:13,990 --> 02:49:14,170
Wow.

1256
02:49:14,830 --> 02:49:15,830
Wow.

1257
02:49:16,210 --> 02:49:17,210
Wow.

1258
02:49:19,190 --> 02:49:20,190
Wow.

1259
02:49:24,310 --> 02:49:27,690
I want to catch this, too.

1260
02:49:27,691 --> 02:49:29,750
I want to catch this, too.

1261
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:31,030
Wow.

1262
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:33,500
Wow.

1263
02:49:36,890 --> 02:49:38,130
This is good.

1264
02:49:38,131 --> 02:49:39,630
This is good.

1265
02:49:39,631 --> 02:49:40,631
This is good.

1266
02:49:43,130 --> 02:49:44,410
I want to taste a lot of things.

1267
02:49:56,500 --> 02:49:59,590
This is good.

1268
02:50:00,040 --> 02:50:01,040
Wow!

1269
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:04,390
Wow!

1270
02:50:04,790 --> 02:50:05,210
Wow!

1271
02:50:05,370 --> 02:50:06,370
Wow!

1272
02:50:08,590 --> 02:50:09,670
Puma-chan, Puma-chan!

1273
02:50:10,370 --> 02:50:12,630
Put this chip in here!

1274
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:28,980
Let's look at it from a close distance.

1275
02:50:30,210 --> 02:50:30,970
Wow!

1276
02:50:30,971 --> 02:50:32,450
Ah, it's in there, it's in there.

1277
02:50:34,670 --> 02:50:37,150
Look, it's in there.

1278
02:50:42,010 --> 02:50:43,010
Ah, amazing.

1279
02:50:49,230 --> 02:50:50,430
There's still time.

1280
02:50:52,830 --> 02:50:54,630
It's really dangerous.
This is going to work.

1281
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:56,070
Eh, it's fast.

1282
02:50:56,071 --> 02:51:01,270
But here, it's a little
hard to do, isn't it?

1283
02:51:01,370 --> 02:51:02,370
Is it over there?

1284
02:51:02,870 --> 02:51:03,450
Over there?

1285
02:51:03,750 --> 02:51:03,950
Yeah.

1286
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:06,070
And one more thing.

1287
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:06,590
Yeah.

1288
02:51:06,830 --> 02:51:08,450
I want you to be more like me.

1289
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:09,790
Like this.

1290
02:51:10,130 --> 02:51:10,690
What?

1291
02:51:10,970 --> 02:51:11,970
If you cover your eyes.

1292
02:51:12,130 --> 02:51:13,130
Cover my eyes?

1293
02:51:13,270 --> 02:51:14,470
I think it's more comfortable.

1294
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:16,710
But if you cover your eyes
and guess whose dick it is.

1295
02:51:16,990 --> 02:51:18,670
Oh, it's like Mickey's dick?

1296
02:51:18,930 --> 02:51:19,070
Yeah.

1297
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:20,950
Raise your bangs.

1298
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:23,330
Can you raise your bangs?

1299
02:51:25,675 --> 02:51:27,690
I can't see anything.

1300
02:51:28,530 --> 02:51:30,090
Let's fix the axis.

1301
02:51:31,570 --> 02:51:32,870
Let's do it.

1302
02:51:36,330 --> 02:51:37,330
Let's do it slowly.

1303
02:51:38,070 --> 02:51:40,510
Is it okay?

1304
02:51:42,070 --> 02:51:44,290
You have to hold here.

1305
02:51:44,510 --> 02:51:45,510
Okay.

1306
02:51:45,850 --> 02:51:47,170
I'll support you with both hands.

1307
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:55,750
I'm tired.

1308
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:02,410
Let's take a break here for a while.

1309
02:52:02,790 --> 02:52:07,010
I feel sick.

1310
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:15,210
I'm sick.

1311
02:52:18,210 --> 02:52:19,870
Lie down in front of me.

1312
02:52:23,830 --> 02:52:24,830
Let me see your feet.

1313
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:43,910
We will do our best
to make you feel better.

1314
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:45,630
We will touch you a lot.

1315
02:52:49,150 --> 02:52:52,070
You don't know who is touching you, do you?

1316
02:52:52,730 --> 02:52:54,790
I don't know.

1317
02:52:54,791 --> 02:52:56,050
Yes, that's right.

1318
02:52:57,790 --> 02:52:59,450
It's good for you to feel better.

1319
02:52:59,990 --> 02:53:02,670
You can move freely.

1320
02:53:06,010 --> 02:53:08,250
Sit here.

1321
02:53:09,630 --> 02:53:11,550
You have a lot of hands.

1322
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:20,070
Raise your hands.

1323
02:53:20,071 --> 02:53:21,186
I'm going to give you a snack.

1324
02:53:21,210 --> 02:53:23,450
What is this?

1325
02:53:27,705 --> 02:53:42,010
I'm going to touch you a lot.

1326
02:53:42,011 --> 02:53:43,211
I'll give you some more, okay?

1327
02:53:48,250 --> 02:54:17,640
I can't see where you are.

1328
02:54:26,975 --> 02:54:28,040
We're doing a great job.

1329
02:54:29,800 --> 02:54:32,380
You don't know whose hand it is, do you?

1330
02:54:34,240 --> 02:54:35,420
You're doing your best.

1331
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:37,120
You have the power to cover your eyes.

1332
02:54:37,121 --> 02:54:38,121
You have a lot of hair.

1333
02:54:57,170 --> 02:54:58,990
How do you feel?

1334
02:54:59,990 --> 02:55:01,330
What's going on?

1335
02:55:03,390 --> 02:55:05,630
All four of us are doing
our best, aren't we?

1336
02:55:06,230 --> 02:55:07,870
Aren't we four?

1337
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:09,830
Why are you turning around?

1338
02:55:13,410 --> 02:55:16,130
Why are you saying that we are not four?

1339
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:19,810
Why?

1340
02:55:19,811 --> 02:55:20,811
Why?

1341
02:55:22,230 --> 02:55:23,230
Why?

1342
02:55:23,630 --> 02:55:24,710
Why?

1343
02:55:24,711 --> 02:55:26,110
I know why.

1344
02:55:27,790 --> 02:55:28,790
Why?

1345
02:55:29,770 --> 02:55:33,330
Do you want to take a blindfold?

1346
02:55:34,310 --> 02:55:35,310
What?

1347
02:55:35,430 --> 02:55:37,070
Take a blindfold.

1348
02:55:37,710 --> 02:55:38,710
Can you take it yourself?

1349
02:55:39,130 --> 02:55:39,950
Yes, I can.

1350
02:55:39,951 --> 02:55:43,970
He's so cute.

1351
02:55:44,470 --> 02:55:45,470
Who is that?

1352
02:55:46,970 --> 02:55:47,970
Hello.

1353
02:55:48,670 --> 02:55:49,670
Hello.

1354
02:55:50,750 --> 02:55:52,390
He's so cute.

1355
02:55:53,030 --> 02:55:57,930
Are you going to stand up?

1356
02:55:59,650 --> 02:56:00,710
He's drunk.

1357
02:56:01,330 --> 02:56:02,890
He drank too much.

1358
02:56:03,610 --> 02:56:05,470
No, no.

1359
02:56:05,590 --> 02:56:06,590
He's definitely drunk.

1360
02:56:07,470 --> 02:56:10,910
Happy, look around.

1361
02:56:11,530 --> 02:56:12,790
I can't.

1362
02:56:13,730 --> 02:56:15,090
Can you look around?

1363
02:56:15,550 --> 02:56:16,550
Yes, I can.

1364
02:56:16,810 --> 02:56:17,810
It looks fun.

1365
02:56:18,130 --> 02:56:19,410
There are four people.

1366
02:56:20,270 --> 02:56:22,250
I can't.

1367
02:56:23,130 --> 02:56:24,570
You asked me to do something.

1368
02:56:25,930 --> 02:56:26,930
Did I?

1369
02:56:27,590 --> 02:56:28,730
What was it?

1370
02:56:29,710 --> 02:56:30,170
Did you forget?

1371
02:56:30,550 --> 02:56:31,550
I'm sorry.

1372
02:56:31,551 --> 02:56:32,551
Congratulations!

1373
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:34,520
Please invite a lot of people.

1374
02:56:36,180 --> 02:56:37,180
I did.

1375
02:56:37,350 --> 02:56:39,250
I invited a lot of people.

1376
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:40,610
Please say hello.

1377
02:56:44,010 --> 02:56:45,010
How about me?

1378
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:46,240
You can't introduce me.

1379
02:56:47,360 --> 02:56:48,360
What's your name?

1380
02:56:49,070 --> 02:56:50,290
I'm Apemaru.

1381
02:56:50,910 --> 02:56:51,910
What did you do today?

1382
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:56,270
I went to have sex.

1383
02:56:56,271 --> 02:56:57,271
I went to the bathroom.

1384
02:56:58,230 --> 02:57:00,570
I wanted to have sex with everyone.

1385
02:57:01,890 --> 02:57:04,250
What about the rubber band?

1386
02:57:06,540 --> 02:57:08,100
I don't think I can wear a rubber band.

1387
02:57:09,220 --> 02:57:10,940
You can wear it in the middle of the night.

1388
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:17,450
I want to have sex with everyone.

1389
02:57:17,830 --> 02:57:18,830
Did you hear that?

1390
02:57:19,530 --> 02:57:20,970
I want to have sex with everyone.

1391
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:26,430
Did you get it?

1392
02:57:26,730 --> 02:57:27,730
Yes.

1393
02:57:27,980 --> 02:57:30,990
Then, let's take care of
my Tapimaru together.

1394
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:05,040
You wanted to eat this, didn't you?

1395
02:58:53,460 --> 02:58:56,780
I'm sorry.

1396
02:58:58,980 --> 02:59:00,080
I'm sorry.

1397
02:59:00,230 --> 02:59:01,460
I'm sorry.

1398
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:03,360
I'm sorry.

1399
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:14,240
Good boy.

1400
02:59:20,310 --> 02:59:21,310
How is it?

1401
02:59:21,720 --> 02:59:23,000
Is it good?

1402
02:59:23,820 --> 02:59:25,020
Yes, it is.

1403
02:59:25,021 --> 02:59:26,820
It's good, isn't it?

1404
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:33,760
Everyone is looking at
Manko, but her skin is beautiful.

1405
02:59:35,900 --> 02:59:40,100
What are you doing?

1406
02:59:40,101 --> 02:59:54,880
Daddy, let me see your butt.

1407
02:59:55,360 --> 02:59:56,520
Show me your butt.

1408
02:59:57,060 --> 02:59:58,140
Show me your butt.

1409
02:59:58,600 --> 02:59:59,600
Show me your butt.

1410
03:00:00,480 --> 03:00:04,360
Show me your butt.

1411
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:08,760
What's in your butt?

1412
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:10,760
I don't know.

1413
03:00:11,940 --> 03:00:12,940
Do you like it?

1414
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:14,700
Do you like it?

1415
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:30,160
Oh, great.

1416
03:00:31,400 --> 03:00:33,320
Your butt is great.

1417
03:00:33,680 --> 03:00:34,820
What's in your butt?

1418
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:36,380
My butt is great.

1419
03:00:36,381 --> 03:00:38,840
What's in your butt?

1420
03:00:38,841 --> 03:00:39,841
What's in your butt?

1421
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:41,560
There is a person who loves my butt.

1422
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:43,420
Are you being licked?

1423
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:45,040
About 2 or 3 people.

1424
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:45,960
Are you being licked?

1425
03:00:46,360 --> 03:00:47,360
I'm being licked.

1426
03:00:51,920 --> 03:00:54,940
I love your butt so much.

1427
03:00:54,941 --> 03:00:55,941
I want more.

1428
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:02,720
I want more.

1429
03:01:05,940 --> 03:01:07,180
I want more.

1430
03:01:07,330 --> 03:01:09,100
You are licking Manko's butt.

1431
03:01:55,410 --> 03:02:11,430
He wants to be hugged.

1432
03:02:11,630 --> 03:02:20,290
He is still in a coma.

1433
03:02:20,291 --> 03:02:21,291
Wow!

1434
03:02:26,710 --> 03:02:28,310
Hurry up!

1435
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:44,780
Good boy!

1436
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:52,660
Can I have some?

1437
03:02:58,410 --> 03:02:59,680
It's good, isn't it?

1438
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:13,920
It's so good.

1439
03:03:13,921 --> 03:03:15,440
Yummy.

1440
03:03:16,240 --> 03:03:17,240
Yummy.

1441
03:03:17,580 --> 03:03:19,800
Everyone likes to eat with salt.

1442
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:35,440
She is drowning.

1443
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:37,640
She is drowning.

1444
03:03:38,340 --> 03:03:39,280
She is drowning.

1445
03:03:39,281 --> 03:03:40,520
You're going to break it.

1446
03:03:42,140 --> 03:03:44,280
Sit down and lie down.

1447
03:03:49,215 --> 03:03:50,660
I'm going to make you a lot harder.

1448
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:53,060
Look at me.

1449
03:04:05,590 --> 03:04:07,360
Look at me.

1450
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,520
Here, too.

1451
03:04:20,521 --> 03:04:21,980
There's a lot.

1452
03:04:22,980 --> 03:04:24,040
Just your mouth.

1453
03:04:34,540 --> 03:04:36,160
Eat this, too.

1454
03:04:45,555 --> 03:04:47,100
Eat this, too.

1455
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:49,640
How do you feel?

1456
03:04:49,641 --> 03:04:50,641
You have a lot of gums.

1457
03:04:50,700 --> 03:04:51,780
I have a lot of gums.

1458
03:04:52,680 --> 03:04:53,680
How do you feel?

1459
03:04:54,180 --> 03:04:55,180
Are you having fun?

1460
03:04:55,700 --> 03:04:56,700
Are you happy?

1461
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,600
Look at your happy face.

1462
03:05:06,540 --> 03:05:09,900
There's still more.

1463
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:12,000
There's still more.

1464
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:18,100
It's okay, it's okay.

1465
03:05:32,430 --> 03:05:35,540
I'm sorry.

1466
03:05:51,380 --> 03:05:58,740
I have a sore throat.

1467
03:06:00,510 --> 03:06:01,380
You have a lot of mouth.

1468
03:06:01,381 --> 03:06:02,381
Does it feel good?

1469
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:06,460
Is it still coming out?

1470
03:06:10,360 --> 03:06:13,880
You have a lot of salt.

1471
03:06:18,240 --> 03:06:20,040
Imari-chan, more and
more chinchin is coming.

1472
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:25,300
New chinchin is coming.

1473
03:06:40,940 --> 03:06:42,900
I'm waiting for chinchin.

1474
03:06:42,901 --> 03:06:43,960
I'm waiting for you.

1475
03:06:56,980 --> 03:06:58,380
Look at the camera.

1476
03:07:01,870 --> 03:07:03,280
I'll lower your head a little bit.

1477
03:07:06,310 --> 03:07:07,580
Oh, my God.

1478
03:07:13,730 --> 03:07:23,960
You're drinking too much.

1479
03:07:23,961 --> 03:07:25,161
Kikuchi, you are being licked.

1480
03:07:25,480 --> 03:07:27,320
Kikuchi, can I have a doggy?

1481
03:07:28,440 --> 03:07:28,920
Yes.

1482
03:07:29,130 --> 03:07:30,130
Sit here.

1483
03:07:32,680 --> 03:07:33,780
I'm going to put it in.

1484
03:07:40,100 --> 03:07:45,140
I'm going to put it in raw.

1485
03:07:48,180 --> 03:08:07,550
You wanted me to put it in raw.

1486
03:08:14,650 --> 03:08:15,650
I'll leave it here.

1487
03:09:33,330 --> 03:09:34,960
What should I do?

1488
03:09:37,960 --> 03:09:40,020
I can't stand it anymore.

1489
03:09:43,700 --> 03:09:47,920
It's okay to take it out
in the middle, isn't it?

1490
03:09:51,150 --> 03:09:53,080
It's a little too much, isn't it?

1491
03:09:57,680 --> 03:09:59,340
It's too much.

1492
03:09:59,341 --> 03:10:02,880
How long have you been silent?

1493
03:10:04,010 --> 03:10:05,010
3 days.

1494
03:10:07,230 --> 03:10:09,380
Can I make you cry more?

1495
03:10:48,550 --> 03:13:06,690
Are you happy?

1496
03:13:06,910 --> 03:13:07,910
Yes.

1497
03:13:20,070 --> 03:13:37,750
It feels good, doesn't it?

1498
03:13:55,520 --> 03:13:56,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1499
03:13:56,920 --> 03:13:57,660
It feels good, doesn't it?

1500
03:13:57,661 --> 03:13:58,661
Here we go.

1501
03:14:05,360 --> 03:14:08,560
It feels good, doesn't it?

1502
03:14:08,860 --> 03:14:13,750
Ah, it feels good.

1503
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:16,810
It feels good.

1504
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:18,970
I'm going to take you to the bathroom.

1505
03:14:29,750 --> 03:14:31,010
I'm going to take you to the bathroom.

1506
03:14:31,011 --> 03:14:34,330
Take it out I'll take it out.

1507
03:14:40,625 --> 03:14:45,630
Can you see it?

1508
03:14:45,631 --> 03:14:52,090
I took it out It feels good.

1509
03:14:54,220 --> 03:15:03,350
Let's take it out.

1510
03:15:06,990 --> 03:15:08,330
It feels so good.

1511
03:15:14,220 --> 03:15:19,820
It's falling.

1512
03:15:22,890 --> 03:16:08,720
It's falling.

1513
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:29,820
I'm scared.

1514
03:16:31,220 --> 03:16:32,220
I'm scared.

1515
03:16:32,470 --> 03:16:34,060

Ah.

1521
03:17:27,635 --> 03:17:28,670
Ah, I'm tired.

1522
03:17:29,970 --> 03:17:31,270
I'm tired.

1523
03:17:32,230 --> 03:17:33,230

Uehhh.

1530
03:17:58,000 --> 03:17:59,000
He's shredding the snow.

1531
03:17:59,400 --> 03:18:00,400
Uehh.

1532
03:18:02,060 --> 03:18:03,080
He's shedding.

Look at her.

1539
03:18:20,980 --> 03:18:26,180
You are pulling her.

1540
03:18:30,750 --> 03:18:33,020
Do you want to hold her mouth?

1541
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:35,780
You are good.

1542
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:42,780
I can't do it.

1543
03:18:57,440 --> 03:19:16,990
Show me your face.

1544
03:19:18,250 --> 03:19:20,010
You have a beautiful body.

1545
03:19:20,330 --> 03:19:21,330
Take off your bra.

1546
03:19:23,110 --> 03:19:25,050
You have a beautiful body.

1547
03:20:21,445 --> 03:20:22,600
It's so hot.

1548
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:24,060
Let's turn on the air conditioner.

1549
03:21:03,840 --> 03:21:05,200
Let's turn on the air conditioner.

1550
03:21:06,360 --> 03:21:07,680
I'll turn on the air conditioner.

1551
03:21:55,725 --> 03:22:34,490
I'm glad you're happy.

1552
03:22:44,200 --> 03:22:46,300
I think I'm going to throw up.

1553
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:05,210
Don't you have to pee?

1554
03:24:05,211 --> 03:24:06,251
Put a lot of kimchi on it.

1555
03:24:06,430 --> 03:24:20,970
Put a lot of kimchi on it.

1556
03:24:21,850 --> 03:24:41,700
Is this kimchi?

1557
03:24:42,460 --> 03:24:43,460
Kimchi.

1558
03:24:44,280 --> 03:24:46,560
There are a lot of things to do.

1559
03:24:47,200 --> 03:24:50,260
Put kimchi on it.

1560
03:25:37,100 --> 03:25:38,100
Be careful.

1561
03:26:34,510 --> 03:26:36,040
What's going on?

1562
03:26:36,570 --> 03:26:39,300
Haki, look at the camera.

1563
03:26:40,330 --> 03:26:41,540
Don't you forget the camera?

1564
03:26:42,860 --> 03:26:44,660
I don't forget.

1565
03:26:44,661 --> 03:26:49,080
You have to say it when you are breathing.

1566
03:26:49,081 --> 03:27:12,400
I'm so tired.

1567
03:27:12,401 --> 03:27:13,401
You're tired, aren't you?

1568
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:17,000
You're thirsty, aren't you?

1569
03:27:17,050 --> 03:27:20,520
Aki-chan, you're thirsty, aren't you?

1570
03:27:20,620 --> 03:27:23,440
Open your mouth and have a drink.

1571
03:27:25,900 --> 03:27:46,320
Open your mouth and have a drink.

1572
03:27:46,321 --> 03:27:48,820
Breathe in, breathe in.

1573
03:27:49,700 --> 03:27:56,800
It's still coming out.

1574
03:28:00,375 --> 03:28:01,060
Keep it in your mouth.

1575
03:28:01,100 --> 03:28:03,320
Don't spill it, don't spill it.

1576
03:28:04,420 --> 03:28:05,380
Don't spill it, don't spill it.

1577
03:28:05,381 --> 03:28:06,381
It's still coming out.

1578
03:28:06,460 --> 03:28:07,460
Don't spill it.

1579
03:28:08,540 --> 03:28:10,700
Keep it in your mouth.

1580
03:28:11,580 --> 03:28:12,580
Don't drink it.

1581
03:28:16,420 --> 03:28:20,300
Get up, get up.

1582
03:28:26,320 --> 03:28:27,320
You can do it.

1583
03:28:57,640 --> 03:28:59,710
Open your mouth.

1584
03:29:03,260 --> 03:29:05,310
Open your mouth.

1585
03:29:06,460 --> 03:29:14,420
You're eating a lot.

1586
03:29:18,860 --> 03:29:20,960
Open your mouth.

1587
03:29:21,580 --> 03:29:23,540
Don't spill it.

1588
03:29:25,580 --> 03:29:29,220
Drink it at the same time as you go.

1589
03:29:33,020 --> 03:29:42,460
Ah... Hmm...

1590
03:29:42,635 --> 03:29:54,020
Hmm... Hmm...

1591
03:29:56,720 --> 03:29:58,980
How do you feel, Sesshi?

1592
03:29:59,060 --> 03:30:00,060
What does it taste like?

1593
03:30:03,330 --> 03:30:05,380
It tastes like something I've eaten before.

1594
03:30:06,790 --> 03:30:07,900
Do you like the smell?

1595
03:30:08,890 --> 03:30:10,090
You like the smell, don't you?

1596
03:30:11,690 --> 03:30:12,300
That's good.

1597
03:30:12,301 --> 03:30:13,301
Good girl.

1598
03:30:23,730 --> 03:30:43,220
Do you want to sit on the chair?

1599
03:30:44,380 --> 03:30:45,380
Let's go.

1600
03:30:49,440 --> 03:30:51,600
Put your hand on the chair.

1601
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:55,940
Let's go inside.

1602
03:31:19,360 --> 03:31:21,860
Your breath is coming
out from the back, isn't it?

1603
03:31:36,550 --> 03:31:37,950
It feels good to be a gyaru-no-man.

1604
03:31:38,440 --> 03:31:39,800
Because you've been sighing a lot.

1605
03:31:43,140 --> 03:31:44,140
Here we go.

1606
03:31:45,580 --> 03:31:46,580
I'm going to push you.

1607
03:31:59,260 --> 03:32:03,760
I'm going to cry.

1608
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:18,140
I'm going to cry.

1609
03:32:18,141 --> 03:32:23,630
I'm going to cry.

1610
03:32:25,290 --> 03:32:26,510
You're so weak.

1611
03:32:56,260 --> 03:32:57,320
I'm so tired.

1612
03:32:59,160 --> 03:32:59,340
You're so weak.

1613
03:32:59,800 --> 03:33:00,800
I'm sorry.

1614
03:33:31,805 --> 03:33:32,805
Wow.

1615
03:34:01,660 --> 03:34:02,660
It's amazing.

1616
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:08,040
It's amazing.

1617
03:34:10,100 --> 03:34:10,220
Wow.

1618
03:34:10,660 --> 03:34:10,900
Wow.

1619
03:34:11,380 --> 03:34:12,380
Wow.

1620
03:34:12,560 --> 03:34:13,720
I've never seen such a thing.

1621
03:34:13,800 --> 03:34:15,120
You should look at it as it is.

1622
03:34:15,121 --> 03:34:16,121
Don't cry.

1623
03:35:30,360 --> 03:35:42,920
I'm going to sleep now.

1624
03:36:17,200 --> 03:36:18,280
Everyone is sleeping there.

1625
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:20,480
Everyone is sleeping.

1626
03:36:20,481 --> 03:36:21,481
You can do it.

1627
03:36:22,580 --> 03:36:25,621
This time... You
can take it off.

1628
03:36:27,260 --> 03:36:28,460
What?

1629
03:36:30,490 --> 03:36:31,660
You can take it off.

1630
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:34,000
You can take it off.

1631
03:36:34,160 --> 03:36:35,980
Let's go.

1632
03:36:45,610 --> 03:36:48,610
It's warm.

1633
03:36:54,050 --> 03:36:55,050
How do you feel now?

1634
03:37:00,020 --> 03:37:02,410
Good boy

1635
03:37:02,660 --> 03:37:05,230
Show me your face.

1636
03:37:11,830 --> 03:37:16,220
Are you alright?

1637
03:37:16,740 --> 03:37:18,841
Give me your urine Breathe in.

1638
03:37:23,580 --> 03:37:26,680
Breathe out.

1639
03:37:31,420 --> 03:37:39,420
Breathe in.

1640
03:37:39,421 --> 03:37:40,421
Breathe out.

1641
03:37:40,520 --> 03:37:44,000
Breathe in.

1642
03:37:48,190 --> 03:37:49,680
Oh, my God.

1643
03:37:52,620 --> 03:38:06,680
Oh, my God.

1644
03:38:10,310 --> 03:38:15,190
Oh, my God.

1645
03:38:15,390 --> 03:38:16,390
Oh, my God.

1646
03:38:22,470 --> 03:38:24,090
You are going to have a baby.

1647
03:38:24,550 --> 03:38:25,770
I'll take a look at you.

1648
03:38:27,950 --> 03:38:29,110
You are going to have a baby.

1649
03:38:34,550 --> 03:38:35,710
You are going to have a baby.

1650
03:38:42,855 --> 03:38:48,530
I'll take a look at you.

1651
03:39:17,200 --> 03:39:20,130
I'm so happy.

1652
03:39:30,780 --> 03:39:31,740
I'm so happy.

1653
03:39:31,741 --> 03:39:32,080
You did a good job.

1654
03:39:32,720 --> 03:39:34,920
Thank you.

1655
03:40:03,480 --> 03:40:21,230
I'm so happy.

1656
03:40:34,750 --> 03:40:36,830
I can't take it anymore.

1657
03:40:43,090 --> 03:40:44,750
I can't take it anymore.

1658
03:40:45,450 --> 03:40:56,610
I can't take it anymore.

1659
03:40:59,410 --> 03:41:00,650
Wow, you are amazing.

1660
03:41:24,610 --> 03:41:25,690
Chibi-chan, open your bowl.

1661
03:41:34,680 --> 03:41:35,680
You got a lot of food.

1662
03:41:36,825 --> 03:41:37,825
I got a lot of food.

1663
03:41:38,810 --> 03:41:41,250
It seems that there are some
people who haven't got food yet.

1664
03:41:46,690 --> 03:41:47,810
Give it to Haki-maru's bowl.

1665
03:41:51,040 --> 03:41:52,440
Give it to Haki-maru's bowl.

1666
03:42:06,590 --> 03:42:07,810
I won't touch you.

1667
03:42:18,960 --> 03:42:21,150
Wow, you are so warm.

1668
03:42:21,151 --> 03:42:22,151
Yes.

1669
03:42:37,600 --> 03:42:38,940
Let's put it all in the bag.

1670
03:42:41,640 --> 03:42:42,080
Are you ready?

1671
03:42:42,540 --> 03:42:43,540
Yes.

1672
03:43:08,060 --> 03:43:09,060
Let's clean up.

1673
03:43:09,435 --> 03:43:11,260
Help me.

1674
03:43:15,720 --> 03:44:22,920
It's okay, it's okay.

1675
03:45:59,870 --> 03:46:00,870
I don't know what to do.

1676
03:46:11,850 --> 03:46:13,980
I don't know what to do.

1677
03:46:15,500 --> 03:46:17,080
I don't know what to do.

1678
03:46:17,680 --> 03:46:18,680
I don't know what to do.

1679
03:46:18,700 --> 03:46:20,780
I don't know what to do.

1680
03:46:21,560 --> 03:46:23,020
I don't know what to do.

1681
03:46:23,021 --> 03:46:23,260
I don't know what to do.

1682
03:46:23,360 --> 03:46:23,580
I don't know what to do.

1683
03:46:23,690 --> 03:46:24,700
I don't know what to do.

1684
03:46:26,660 --> 03:46:27,580
I don't know what to do.

1685
03:46:27,581 --> 03:46:27,820
I don't know what to do.

1686
03:46:27,821 --> 03:46:28,821
I don't know what to do.

1687
03:46:30,790 --> 03:46:35,370
Have a seat.

1688
03:46:39,050 --> 03:46:57,380
You're so beautiful.

1689
03:47:03,065 --> 03:47:05,600
I'm sorry.

1690
03:47:07,350 --> 03:47:08,700
Please leave me alone.

1691
03:47:09,640 --> 03:47:59,830
You must be exhausted.

1692
03:48:04,980 --> 03:48:11,250
What did you think of when you were killed?

1693
03:48:16,510 --> 03:48:23,620
I was thinking about my family.

1694
03:48:24,660 --> 03:48:26,760
Did you taste each one of them?

1695
03:48:27,540 --> 03:48:28,540
Yes.

1696
03:48:29,120 --> 03:48:30,120
I see.

1697
03:48:31,760 --> 03:48:32,760
But you had a good life.

1698
03:48:32,920 --> 03:48:33,920
Yes, I did.

1699
03:48:34,120 --> 03:48:36,040
Do you want to take it home?

1700
03:48:38,040 --> 03:48:39,220
I want to.

1701
03:48:39,920 --> 03:48:40,480
You do?

1702
03:48:40,700 --> 03:48:41,140
Yes.

1703
03:48:41,141 --> 03:48:41,260
Good.

1704
03:48:42,120 --> 03:48:43,120
Really?

1705
03:48:43,160 --> 03:48:44,160
Yes.

1706
03:48:44,740 --> 03:48:45,740
Yes.

1707
03:48:46,690 --> 03:48:48,250
If we exchange our contact information.

1708
03:48:51,220 --> 03:48:53,280
It's fun to have more followers.

1709
03:48:55,460 --> 03:48:57,220
I wonder if I'll increase it.

1710
03:49:00,400 --> 03:49:02,096
This kind of stimulation is good, isn't it?

1711
03:49:02,120 --> 03:49:03,120
It was the best!

1712
03:49:04,240 --> 03:49:05,480
You wanted to play, didn't you?

1713
03:49:05,630 --> 03:49:06,640
Yes, I did.

1714
03:49:08,900 --> 03:49:09,940
Do you want to play again?

1715
03:49:11,140 --> 03:49:12,560
Yes, I want to play again.

1716
03:49:13,800 --> 03:49:14,820
Then, let's play more.

1717
03:49:15,830 --> 03:49:19,180
No, I don't want to.

1718
03:49:20,700 --> 03:49:23,520
Anyway, you are full today.

1719
03:49:26,380 --> 03:49:27,100
See you next time.

1720
03:49:27,225 --> 03:49:29,100
See you next time.

1721
03:49:31,070 --> 03:49:32,070
Good night.

1722
03:49:32,280 --> 03:49:33,280
Bye bye.
