1
16.11 --> 21.64
 I have a good feeling about this.

2
21.64 --> 25.68
 Asano, what's wrong?

3
25.68 --> 27.60
 I don't know, so get a hold of yourself.

4
42.46 --> 44.30
 It's nice to have an atmosphere, isn't it?

5
44.30 --> 50.30
 Yes.

6
57.57 --> 58.81
 What's wrong, Asano?

7
58.81 --> 61.01
 I'm fine.

8
61.01 --> 62.37
 Take a break.

9
62.37 --> 63.57
 Sit down.

10
63.57 --> 74.10
 This is your favorite restaurant, isn't it?

11
74.10 --> 76.10
 It looks delicious.

12
76.10 --> 80.89
 Let's eat.

13
80.89 --> 81.89
 What's wrong?

14
81.89 --> 83.45
 You don't look happy.

15
83.45 --> 86.25
 I'm not happy.

16
86.25 --> 88.29
 Aren't you happy?

17
88.29 --> 93.65
 I brought you to the hot spring.

18
93.65 --> 97.39
 Thank you very much.

19
97.39 --> 98.47
 Director.

20
98.47 --> 101.19
 Do you have dinner?

21
101.19 --> 106.23
 You should have come with me.

22
106.23 --> 111.08
 Tina.

23
111.08 --> 117.20
 You walk ahead of me, so I just looked at the scenery.

24
117.20 --> 119.60
 I see.

25
119.60 --> 121.96
 I'm happy.

26
121.96 --> 124.56
 It's been a long time since I took a break.

27
124.56 --> 126.64
 I finally came to the hot spring.

28
126.64 --> 128.80
 Are you happy?

29
128.80 --> 130.84
 Yes.

30
130.84 --> 136.65
 Thank you for your luggage.

31
136.65 --> 138.25
 I'm sorry.

32
138.25 --> 141.05
 I took a long break.

33
141.05 --> 142.85
 What are you talking about?

34
142.85 --> 146.33
 You look like you're in a good mood.

35
146.33 --> 148.73
 Don't you think so?

36
148.73 --> 152.25
 Yes.

37
152.25 --> 156.49
 We are in the same room.

38
156.49 --> 158.49
 You don't have to be careful.

39
158.49 --> 161.81
 It doesn't matter if you're in a good mood or not.

40
164.05 --> 167.05
 Let's take a bath.

41
167.05 --> 169.05
 I have prepared a bath for you.

42
169.05 --> 174.02
 I just got here.

43
174.02 --> 177.02
 I haven't changed my clothes yet.

44
177.02 --> 180.02
 There is a yukata over there.

45
180.02 --> 181.02
 Change into that.

46
181.02 --> 194.13
 I'll change over there.

47
194.13 --> 195.13
 OK.

48
195.13 --> 222.25
 Masano.

49
222.25 --> 225.25
 Get ready.

50
225.25 --> 229.03
 It's a bath.

51
229.03 --> 230.03
 Do you understand?

52
230.03 --> 234.37
 Director.

53
234.37 --> 269.10
 Are you serious?

54
269.10 --> 277.11
 What do you think?

55
277.11 --> 280.11
 It's an order.

56
280.11 --> 402.17
 I'm counting on you.

57
402.17 --> 404.17
 How do you feel?

58
404.17 --> 409.57
 I feel good.

59
417.14 --> 420.58
 It's a better bath than I thought.

60
420.58 --> 422.58
 Are you glad you came here?

61
422.58 --> 424.58
 Yes.

62
424.58 --> 427.58
 The previous bath was narrow.

63
427.58 --> 429.58
 I'm glad I came here.

64
429.58 --> 434.78
 The previous bath was...

65
434.78 --> 435.78
 What?

66
435.78 --> 439.78
 You didn't hate it, did you?

67
439.78 --> 441.78
 That's right.

68
441.78 --> 442.78
 But you...

69
442.78 --> 444.78
 It was my first bath.

70
444.78 --> 446.78
 I was surprised.

71
446.78 --> 448.78
 I was very excited.

72
448.78 --> 453.78
 I'm not a bad person.

73
453.78 --> 455.78
 I'm serious.

74
455.78 --> 458.78
 I can't work.

75
458.78 --> 466.63
 I called you.

76
466.63 --> 468.63
 Did you call me now?

77
468.63 --> 471.63
 Wait a minute.

78
471.63 --> 476.63
 I don't have much time.

79
476.63 --> 478.63
 It's my second bath.

80
478.63 --> 481.63
 I'm counting on you.

81
481.63 --> 483.63
 Again?

82
483.63 --> 484.63
 Masano.

83
484.63 --> 486.63
 Get ready.

84
486.63 --> 489.63
 Come here.

85
489.63 --> 491.63
 Hurry up.

86
491.63 --> 494.63
 Okay.

87
503.26 --> 505.26
 It's a good bath, isn't it?

88
505.26 --> 507.26
 That's right.

89
511.26 --> 513.26
 It's fun.

90
518.63 --> 520.63
 Tina.

91
520.63 --> 523.63
 Wash Masano's body.

92
523.63 --> 526.63
 You came here.

93
526.63 --> 529.63
 Tina, wash Masano's body.

94
529.63 --> 539.72
 I'm counting on you.

95
544.89 --> 545.89
 Masano.

96
545.89 --> 548.89
 Wash Tina's body.

97
548.89 --> 550.89
 Wash Tina's body.

98
550.89 --> 552.89
 It's a girl's bath.

99
552.89 --> 553.89
 Okay.

100
553.89 --> 563.34
 Wash Tina's body.

101
563.34 --> 573.47
 Wash Tina's body.

102
573.47 --> 575.47
 Do you feel good?

103
575.47 --> 581.70
 Yes, I feel good.

104
581.70 --> 583.70
 Is there a girl here?

105
583.70 --> 585.70
 No.

106
585.70 --> 586.70
 Is there a girl here?

107
586.70 --> 590.70
 Yes, there is.

108
590.70 --> 596.08
 You look like a girl.

109
596.08 --> 598.08
 Why are you surprised?

110
598.08 --> 600.08
 Are you happy?

111
600.08 --> 602.08
 Yes.

112
602.08 --> 605.52
 Wash Tina's body.

113
605.52 --> 608.52
 I'm sorry.

114
608.52 --> 610.52
 I'm sorry.

115
610.52 --> 613.96
 Are you happy?

116
613.96 --> 618.30
 Don't cry.

117
618.30 --> 621.30
 I'm fine.

118
621.30 --> 623.30
 You're still young.

119
623.30 --> 628.30
 Tina, wash Masano's eyes.

120
628.30 --> 633.30
 Wash Masano's eyes.

121
633.30 --> 636.30
 Masano said he was fine.

122
636.30 --> 639.30
 Was he okay?

123
639.30 --> 641.30
 What are you talking about?

124
641.30 --> 645.30
 Wash Tina's body.

125
645.30 --> 646.30
 Okay.

126
646.30 --> 649.30
 Wash Tina's body.

127
649.30 --> 653.30
 Come closer.

128
653.30 --> 659.40
 Come closer.

129
659.40 --> 661.40
 I can't see.

130
661.40 --> 664.40
 It's okay.

131
664.40 --> 670.57
 Turn around.

132
670.57 --> 672.57
 Wash Tina's body.

133
672.57 --> 681.23
 You've never done this before.

134
681.23 --> 690.86
 That's right.

135
690.86 --> 697.36
 I'm fine.

136
697.36 --> 701.36
 Wash Masano's body.

137
701.36 --> 703.36
 Wash Masano's body?

138
703.36 --> 704.36
 Yes.

139
704.36 --> 707.36
 Masano, turn your body.

140
707.36 --> 709.36
 Wash Masano's body.

141
709.36 --> 710.36
 This way?

142
710.36 --> 714.18
 Yes.

143
714.18 --> 716.18
 I'm embarrassed.

144
716.18 --> 719.18
 I'm embarrassed.

145
719.18 --> 724.18
 I'm excited.

146
724.18 --> 737.80
 Show me your body.

147
737.80 --> 742.65
 It's good.

148
742.65 --> 745.65
 What are you doing?

149
745.65 --> 748.65
 It was hard to wash.

150
748.65 --> 750.65
 Keep washing.

151
750.65 --> 753.65
 I can't.

152
753.65 --> 756.65
 Wash Masano's body.

153
756.65 --> 758.65
 You only washed the upper body.

154
758.65 --> 761.65
 I can't see.

155
761.65 --> 763.65
 It's okay.

156
763.65 --> 772.22
 Wash Masano's body with both hands.

157
772.22 --> 775.22
 What's wrong with Masano?

158
775.22 --> 779.22
 You don't have to cover your body.

159
779.22 --> 781.22
 This is in the way.

160
781.22 --> 786.22
 I'm sorry.

161
786.22 --> 788.22
 Masano.

162
788.22 --> 792.22
 What's wrong with you?

163
792.22 --> 794.22
 You're angry.

164
794.22 --> 796.22
 I'm sorry.

165
796.22 --> 799.22
 Are you excited to see Tina's body?

166
799.22 --> 802.22
 Masano is young.

167
802.22 --> 804.22
 Tina.

168
804.22 --> 807.22
 Wash Masano's body.

169
807.22 --> 808.22
 What are you doing?

170
808.22 --> 811.22
 Why are you so angry?

171
811.22 --> 813.22
 Wash Masano's body.

172
813.22 --> 814.22
 It's okay.

173
814.22 --> 816.22
 I'll wash it myself.

174
816.22 --> 818.22
 I told you not to hold back.

175
818.22 --> 820.22
 Yes.

176
820.22 --> 822.22
 Tina.

177
822.22 --> 826.22
 What's wrong with you?

178
826.22 --> 832.50
 Masano is excited to see Tina's body.

179
832.50 --> 838.96
 Wash Masano's body.

180
838.96 --> 853.39
 I'll watch you.

181
853.39 --> 856.39
 You're young.

182
856.39 --> 858.39
 You're different from me.

183
858.39 --> 860.39
 You're hard.

184
860.39 --> 863.39
 What are you talking about?

185
863.39 --> 869.09
 How do you feel?

186
869.09 --> 872.09
 Do you feel good?

187
872.09 --> 873.09
 Yes.

188
873.09 --> 876.09
 That's right.

189
876.09 --> 879.09
 Tina, do you feel good?

190
879.09 --> 881.09
 Wash Masano's body.

191
881.09 --> 883.09
 More?

192
883.09 --> 893.04
 Wash Masano's body.

193
893.04 --> 895.04
 I'm okay.

194
895.04 --> 899.04
 Masano says he's okay.

195
900.04 --> 903.04
 Masano, stand up.

196
903.04 --> 905.04
 Okay.

197
905.04 --> 910.82
 Look at Tina.

198
910.82 --> 913.82
 Tina is excited.

199
913.82 --> 916.82
 Wash Masano's body.

200
916.82 --> 918.82
 Do I have to wash it again?

201
918.82 --> 919.82
 Yes.

202
919.82 --> 924.39
 You look good.

203
924.39 --> 935.62
 How do you feel?

204
935.62 --> 937.62
 I'm hard.

205
937.62 --> 939.62
 What are you talking about?

206
939.62 --> 944.44
 Don't tell me.

207
944.44 --> 948.44
 I want to hear it from you.

208
948.44 --> 957.44
 Masano's body is very hard.

209
957.44 --> 961.44
 Am I hard?

210
961.44 --> 963.44
 Don't tell me that.

211
963.44 --> 965.44
 I want to hear it.

212
965.44 --> 967.44
 I can't tell you.

213
967.44 --> 969.44
 Tell me.

214
969.44 --> 973.26
 Don't tell me.

215
973.26 --> 975.26
 I'm hard, right?

216
975.26 --> 976.26
 Yes.

217
976.26 --> 982.33
 I see.

218
982.33 --> 985.33
 Look at his face.

219
985.33 --> 990.15
 Look at his face.

220
990.15 --> 992.15
 Do you feel good?

221
992.15 --> 997.55
 I feel good, but I'm embarrassed.

222
997.55 --> 999.55
 I'll tell you.

223
999.55 --> 1005.55
 Do you feel good?

224
1005.55 --> 1008.55
 Do you feel good?

225
1008.55 --> 1023.47
 Yes.

226
1023.47 --> 1026.47
 Tina.

227
1026.47 --> 1035.52
 Wash his body.

228
1035.52 --> 1043.16
 Wash his body.

229
1043.16 --> 1053.22
 Look at him.

230
1053.22 --> 1055.22
 He's excited.

231
1055.22 --> 1058.92
 Masano.

232
1058.92 --> 1063.23
 What are you excited about?

233
1063.23 --> 1069.04
 You're a man.

234
1069.04 --> 1075.38
 He's excited.

235
1075.38 --> 1081.07
 I can't stand your face.

236
1082.07 --> 1084.07
 What are you doing?

237
1092.15 --> 1094.15
 Tina.

238
1094.15 --> 1097.15
 Give him a kiss.

239
1097.15 --> 1099.15
 What are you talking about?

240
1099.15 --> 1102.15
 Give him a kiss.

241
1102.15 --> 1118.52
 What are you talking about?

242
1118.52 --> 1156.56
 Show him to me.

243
1156.56 --> 1157.56
 Okay.

244
1157.56 --> 1159.56
 Give him a kiss.

245
1166.48 --> 1169.48
 Do you feel good?

246
1169.48 --> 1185.14
 I feel good.

247
1185.14 --> 1187.14
 He's excited.

248
1196.00 --> 1198.00
 Give him a kiss.

249
1210.91 --> 1212.91
 Show him your face.

250
1212.91 --> 1214.91
 Don't do that.

251
1215.91 --> 1217.91
 Masano.

252
1217.91 --> 1218.91
 I'm in trouble.

253
1218.91 --> 1220.91
 Don't do that.

254
1220.91 --> 1222.91
 I'm not doing that.

255
1222.91 --> 1224.91
 Give him a kiss.

256
1224.91 --> 1227.91
 I want you to touch him.

257
1227.91 --> 1230.91
 Give him a kiss.

258
1233.91 --> 1236.91
 I'm telling you.

259
1236.91 --> 1239.91
 I'm telling you.

260
1239.91 --> 1241.91
 Give him a kiss.

261
1244.91 --> 1246.91
 Are you okay?

262
1248.91 --> 1250.91
 Do you feel good?

263
1250.91 --> 1252.91
 How do you feel when I touch you?

264
1252.91 --> 1255.91
 I think you're overdoing it.

265
1255.91 --> 1257.91
 Do you feel good?

266
1259.91 --> 1261.91
 Do you feel good?

267
1267.48 --> 1269.48
 You have a weak nipple.

268
1276.48 --> 1278.48
 You have a loud voice.

269
1279.48 --> 1282.48
 There's a snack bar next door.

270
1284.48 --> 1286.48
 You're so loud.

271
1290.50 --> 1292.50
 Show him your face.

272
1292.50 --> 1297.98
 Don't do that.

273
1297.98 --> 1300.98
 Touch him like this.

274
1300.98 --> 1301.98
 Like this?

275
1301.98 --> 1302.98
 Yes.

276
1308.00 --> 1310.00
 You like to be touched.

277
1311.00 --> 1312.00
 Like this.

278
1313.00 --> 1316.00
 Give him a kiss.

279
1337.14 --> 1338.14
 Don't be so hard on him.

280
1338.14 --> 1340.14
 Give him a kiss.

281
1345.10 --> 1348.10
 Both of you feel good.

282
1354.73 --> 1356.73
 Both of you feel good.

283
1356.73 --> 1358.73
 Give him a kiss.

284
1358.73 --> 1363.70
 I'll lick you.

285
1365.70 --> 1367.70
 I'll put a fire on you.

286
1368.70 --> 1370.70
 Do you feel good?

287
1373.70 --> 1375.70
 I'll put a fire on you.

288
1379.70 --> 1382.70
 I think you've had enough sleep.

289
1385.70 --> 1388.70
 I'll put a fire on you.

290
1388.70 --> 1390.70
 You want to see Asada, don't you?

291
1390.70 --> 1392.70
 I'll put a fire on you.

292
1393.70 --> 1395.70
 I'll put a fire on you.

293
1396.70 --> 1398.70

294
1399.70 --> 1401.70
 I'll put a fire on you.

295
1401.70 --> 1403.70
 You're beautiful.

296
1410.70 --> 1416.19
 Don't be so hard on him.

297
1416.19 --> 1417.19
 Come closer.

298
1419.19 --> 1421.19
 Look at him closer.

299
1421.19 --> 1423.19
 Don't be so hard on him.

300
1423.19 --> 1425.19
 You want to see him, don't you?

301
1427.19 --> 1430.19
 I'm putting a fire on you.

302
1433.19 --> 1434.19
 Stop it.

303
1434.19 --> 1436.19
 I'll put a fire on you.

304
1436.19 --> 1438.19
 I'm putting a fire on you.

305
1438.19 --> 1443.30
 I'll put a fire on you.

306
1443.30 --> 1446.30
 Stop it.

307
1447.30 --> 1450.30
 Look at him closer.

308
1450.30 --> 1451.30
 Like this?

309
1451.30 --> 1453.30
 Come closer.

310
1454.30 --> 1456.30
 Stop it.

311
1458.30 --> 1460.30
 You're beautiful.

312
1460.30 --> 1462.30
 I'm putting a fire on you.

313
1470.70 --> 1472.70
 Why are you wet?

314
1472.70 --> 1474.70
 I'm not wet.

315
1474.70 --> 1477.70
 Did you fall down because you were looked at by Asada?

316
1478.70 --> 1481.70
 Did you fall down because you were looked at by Asada?

317
1483.70 --> 1485.70
 Which one is it?

318
1486.70 --> 1488.70
 Don't ask me that.

319
1491.21 --> 1494.21
 You're easy to get wet.

320
1505.78 --> 1507.78
 I'll show you.

321
1513.78 --> 1515.78
 Look at Asada.

322
1518.78 --> 1520.78
 You're wet.

323
1522.78 --> 1527.56
 You're always wet.

324
1530.56 --> 1535.98
 Look at him closer.

325
1536.98 --> 1538.98
 Stop it.

326
1539.98 --> 1545.22
 Look at him.

327
1553.71 --> 1571.17
 You're too big.

328
1594.61 --> 1598.82
 I'm putting a fire on you.

329
1598.82 --> 1600.82
 Look at Asada.

330
1600.82 --> 1602.82
 Look at him.

331
1604.82 --> 1610.30
 Hold his legs.

332
1612.30 --> 1614.30
 Look at Asada.

333
1614.30 --> 1616.30
 You're weak.

334
1629.71 --> 1634.37
 Stop it.

335
1634.37 --> 1636.37
 I'm putting a fire on you.

336
1645.48 --> 1652.57
 Did you fall down?

337
1652.57 --> 1656.39
 I'm putting a fire on you.

338
1658.96 --> 1660.96
 Look at Asada.

339
1661.96 --> 1663.96
 Look at Asada.

340
1663.96 --> 1665.96
 Look at him.

341
1665.96 --> 1667.96
 You're too big.

342
1669.96 --> 1671.96
 Did you fall down because you were looked at by Asada?

343
1672.96 --> 1674.96
 I'm putting a fire on you.

344
1676.96 --> 1678.96
 You want me to look at you, don't you?

345
1679.96 --> 1681.96
 Look at Asada.

346
1685.40 --> 1687.40
 I can't.

347
1689.40 --> 1692.97
 I can't.

348
1692.97 --> 1694.97
 I'm putting a fire on you.

349
1694.97 --> 1702.76
 I'm putting a fire on you.

350
1702.76 --> 1704.76
 Stop it.

351
1706.76 --> 1708.76
 Look at Asada.

352
1730.46 --> 1732.46
 Do you feel good?

353
1735.46 --> 1737.46
 Are you better than me?

354
1744.10 --> 1746.10
 Stop it.

355
1752.10 --> 1754.10
 Stop it.

356
1757.62 --> 1759.62
 Look at Asada.

357
1759.62 --> 1761.62
 Stop it.

358
1762.62 --> 1764.62
 Let me do it.

359
1780.38 --> 1782.38
 Are you okay?

360
1782.38 --> 1784.38
 I'm putting a fire on you.

361
1784.38 --> 1786.38
 You're stronger than before.

362
1786.38 --> 1814.02
 You're stronger than before.

363
1815.02 --> 1817.02
 I see.

364
1817.02 --> 1819.02
 You did a good job.

365
1822.02 --> 1824.02
 Look at the kitchen.

366
1827.02 --> 1829.02
 It's cold.

367
1829.02 --> 1831.02
 Look at the shield.

368
1831.02 --> 1837.53
 Let me lick it.

369
1839.53 --> 1841.53
 Do you want me to lick it?

370
1849.49 --> 1851.49
 Is the food delicious?

371
1851.49 --> 1853.49
 It's delicious.

372
1860.02 --> 1863.52
 Do you feel good?

373
1872.83 --> 1876.53
 I'm putting a fire on you.

374
1887.55 --> 1889.55
 Do you feel good?

379
1940.84 --> 1942.84
 How do you feel?

380
1942.84 --> 1945.84
 Which one do you feel better?

381
1947.84 --> 1949.84
 Don't ask me that.

382
1949.84 --> 1951.84
 Tell me.

383
1951.84 --> 1953.84
 Stop it.

384
1953.84 --> 1955.84
 You're mean.

385
1956.84 --> 1958.84
 I can't say that.

386
1962.84 --> 1964.84
 I'm putting a fire on you.

387
1968.84 --> 1972.86
 Let me put a fire on you.

388
1987.48 --> 1989.48
 That's great.

 Look at me.

390
1992.48 --> 1996.18
 That's great.

391
1996.18 --> 1998.18
 Look at me.

392
2003.18 --> 2005.18
 Do you feel good?

393
2005.18 --> 2014.82
 Yes.

394
2015.82 --> 2017.82
 That's great.

395
2036.39 --> 2040.47
 Lie down there.

396
2045.91 --> 2047.91
 I'm putting a fire on you.

397
2047.91 --> 2049.91
 I can't stand it anymore.

398
2052.91 --> 2054.91
 I'm putting a fire on you.

399
2055.91 --> 2057.91
 I'm putting a fire on you.

400
2063.91 --> 2065.91
 Do you feel good?

401
2067.91 --> 2071.54
 What's wrong?

402
2071.54 --> 2080.10
 Are you excited?

403
2085.21 --> 2088.21
 I can hear your heartbeat.

404
2089.21 --> 2105.26
 You're making a noise.

405
2107.26 --> 2109.26
 I'm putting a fire on you.

406
2110.26 --> 2112.26
 Let me put a fire on you.

407
2117.26 --> 2122.04
 Come here.

408

 Do you feel good?

420
2309.49 --> 2311.49
 Do you feel good?

421
4907.88 --> 4909.88
 I can't get up.

422
4910.88 --> 4917.42
 Let me help you.

423
4919.42 --> 4924.72
 Let me help you.

424
4925.72 --> 4927.72
 I can't get up.

425
4931.72 --> 4933.72
 I can't get up.

426
4936.72 --> 4938.72
 I can't get up.

427
4938.72 --> 4940.72
 You are so cute, Tina.

428
4941.72 --> 4943.72
 Please get on my shoulder.

429
4945.72 --> 4947.72
 Don't you want to talk to me?

430
4954.82 --> 4956.82
 Let me touch you.

431
4960.82 --> 4968.04
 Let me touch you.

432
4972.44 --> 4974.44
 Let me touch you.

433
4974.44 --> 4983.26
 Is it good?

434
4987.26 --> 4989.26
 Let me hear you say it's good.

435
4990.26 --> 4992.26
 It's good, isn't it?

436
4997.26 --> 4999.26
 It's good, isn't it?

437
5050.68 --> 5052.68
 It's good, isn't it?

438
5065.85 --> 5075.24
 I'll put it all the way in.

439
5076.24 --> 5078.24
 That's the face.

440
5078.24 --> 5080.24
 That's the face.

441
5095.75 --> 5097.75
 Open your mouth.

442
5099.75 --> 5101.75
 Is it that good?

443
5104.75 --> 5106.75
 That's a very nasty voice.

444
5108.75 --> 5110.75
 You're dead.

445
5112.75 --> 5114.75
 You can't even feel it.

446
5114.75 --> 5116.75
 You can't even feel it.

447
5117.75 --> 5119.75
 I'll kill you.
