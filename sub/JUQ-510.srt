1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,740
Good morning, everyone!

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,260
Good morning!

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,700
It's the 20th anniversary of HITOZUMA
JUKUJO's No.1 maker, Madonna!

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,660
It's all thanks to the fans who supported
Madonna and the cast and crew.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,940
Thank you so much!

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,380
Thank you!

7
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:39,381
Thank you very much!

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,980
To celebrate the 20th anniversary,

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,240
the legendary school
bus tour has been revived!

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,580
Yeah!

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,140
But it's not just a revival.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,620
This time, not only men,

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,380
but also actresses from
Madonna will feel good.

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,140
Yeah!

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Let's get on the bus!

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,040
Let's go!

17
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,220
Now, I would like to divide
the actresses into four teams.

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,420
We will be divided into four
teams, and we will go, go, and go.

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,940
Please enjoy a lot of places where
you can make men go and make men go.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,600
Then I would like to
draw a lottery right away.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Please introduce yourself
when you draw a lottery.

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:52,730
Actually, I don't have one.

23
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,510
I don't know which team
I'm in, but I'm Maki Komoda.

I'm sorry for the noise
in this 20th anniversary

25

I'm very nervous.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,260

He's coming down.

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
It's hot, isn't it?

Yes.

165
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,500
We're also single.

166
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,260
You look happy.

167
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm so happy to see you happy.

168
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm happy, too.

169
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
I'm happy, too.

170
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,880
Can I touch you a little bit?

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,220
Are you okay?

172
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,540
Yes, I'm fine.

173
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,800
I think you've grown up.

174
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,920
I think so, too.

175
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,520
You have a great tongue.

176
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:25,620
You have a great tongue.

177
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,621
It's amazing.

178
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,140
You are quite sensitive.

179
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I think so.

180
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,560
It's getting very hard.

181
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
It's getting hard.

182
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
It's amazing.

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,300
It's a waste to touch it so soon.

184
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,240
How big is it?

185
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,840
I don't know its shape.

186
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,840
It's amazing.

187
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,620
Where does it come from?

188
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,720
Is it small?

189
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,240
I don't know because it's too big.

190
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
Is it small?

191
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
What's going on?

192
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,340
It's amazing.

193
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,620
It has a small neck.

194
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,620
I'm going to die.

195
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
I'm going to die.

196
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm going to die.

197
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm going to die.

198
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Oh, my God.

199
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,280
I can't do it anymore.

200
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
It's too big.

201
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm surprised.

202
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,720
Come here.

203
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,500
It's too big.

204
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,800
This is a good one.

205
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,780
From here.

206
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm going to die.

207
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,240
I'm going to die.

208
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,241
I'm so happy.

209
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,370
He's crying.

210
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
He's crying.

211
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,460
It hurts.

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,740
He's crying.

213
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
He's crying.

214
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,800
He has a big face.

215
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,620
You can't put it on your boobs.

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,820
I can't put it on my boobs.

217
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:31,880
It's coming out well.

218
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
It's beautiful.

219
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,140
It's coming out well.

220
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,460
It's so soft.

221
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,600
It's stained.

222
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,020
It's stained.

223
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,300
It's stained.

224
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,260
It's painful.

225
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,240
It's painful.

226
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
It's painful.

227
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,600
I want to see what happens.

228
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:52,601
I want to see it.

229
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
She is kind.

230
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I want to see it.

231
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Do you want to see it?

232
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,040
I want to see it.

233
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,041
I want to see it.

234
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Do you want to see it?

235
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Yes, I do.

236
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,720
Show it to me.

237
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,470
It's big.

238
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,830
It's big.

239
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,910
This one is also big.

240
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,990
This one is also big.

241
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:24,470
Let me show you.

242
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
It's amazing.

243
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,290
I didn't know it was like this.

244
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,130
It's hard.

245
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,170
Can you bend it?

246
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,250
Can you see it?

247
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,870
Can you see it?

248
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,530
I want to see it.

249
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,210
Here we go.

250
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,710
One, two.

251
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,850
It's amazing.

252
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,450
It's thick.

253
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,990
It's so big.

254
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,770
It's so hard.

255
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,730
It's so big.

256
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,350
It's so big.

257
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:12,010
It's your 20th anniversary.

258
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,550
20th anniversary.

259
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,570
It's so big.

260
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,090
She is so cute.

261
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,091
Her head is bouncing.

262
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
She is so cute.

263
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,570
Her head is bouncing.

264
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,050
She is so cute.

265
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,970
What are you going to do with her?

266
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,150
I don't know.

267
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,490
Maybe I should cut her hair.

268
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,290
I don't know what to do with her.

269
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,630
I don't know what to do with her.

270
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,650
I don't know what to do with her.

271
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
Please.

272
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,270
Please stop.

273
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,810
It's so cute!

274
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,630
It's so good!

275
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,390
I can't put my mouth in.

276
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,230
Really?

277
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:10,610
It's so big that I can't get in.

278
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,810
It's really big.

279
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,490
It's amazing.

280
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,370
It's so big.

281
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,770
It's really big.

282
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,490
No matter how big it is, I can't get in.

283
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,290
He looks like he's in a good mood.

284
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,950
Do you feel good?

285
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,230
He looks like he's in a good mood.

286
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,030
He looks like he's in a good mood.

287
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,990
He's so cute.

288
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,910
He's getting better.

289
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,130
What's he doing?

290
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,320
He's licking me.

291
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,580
He's licking you, so you
are bigger than before.

292
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,940
He's licking you!

293
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,000
He's licking you!

294
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,740
Wow!

295
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
It feels good to play with you.

296
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,120
It's amazing.

297
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,121
It's a goldfish.

298
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,720
It's a goldfish.

299
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
It's amazing.

300
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,020
It's amazing.

301
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:56,800
I'll have one, too.

302
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Do you like it?

303
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,300
It's amazing.

304
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,301
You're so good.

305
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,640
He's so good.

306
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,960
Don't do that.

307
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Don't do that.

308
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,660
It tastes like pepper.

309
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,661
How does it taste?

310
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,180
It's good.

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,740
Itadakimasu.

312
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,180
Thank you.

313
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,880
It's good.

314
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:45,881
It's so cute.

315
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,640
It's so cute.

316
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,800
It keeps wiggling its tail.

317
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,960
It's pushing it.

318
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,280
Even a small one can get fat.

319
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,480
It's so sexy.

320
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,560
It's getting bigger again.

321
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,120
How big will it get?

322
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
It's a good boy.

323
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,420
Do you want a strong one?

324
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,720
Do you want a gentle one?

325
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,760
Which one do you want?

326
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Both?

327
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,960
What a good boy!

328
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
No, no, no!

329
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,540
You have to have more fun!

330
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,500
No, no, no!

331
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,525
He's out of breath.

332
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
He's surprised.

333
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,980
No, no!

334
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:40,981
You can't!

335
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
You can't!

336
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
You really can't do it!

337
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880

What is it, Zaki-kun?

415
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
It's holding it in!

416
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,720

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,050
This is embarrassing.

426
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,230
I can't do it either.

427
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,550
This is amazing.

428
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,110
Can I lick it?

429
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,260
This is amazing.

430
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,620

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,500
Can I go home?

438
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:27,820
Can I go home?

439
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:28,901
I wonder if I can meet her.

440
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,760

I feel good.

457
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:47,050
My body is getting warmer.

458
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,750
I'm sweating.

459
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,150
I'm sweating.

460
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,760

Did you enjoy the welcome trip?

495
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
We enjoyed it!

496
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,720
Let's do a lot of
ecstasy things after this!

497
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:41,800
Yes, that's right.

Have you started?

It's been a while since we've done this.

505
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
It's been a while.

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,860
I was told that I could do something nice.

507

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,250
It's been a while since we've done this.

514
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,350
It's been a while.

515
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,950
How do you feel?

516
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,170
Good.

517
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,650
How do you feel?

518
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,750
Good.

519
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,290
Good.

520
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,550
How do you feel?

521
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,030
Good.

522
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:28,570
The chocolate has hardened.

523
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,571
Did you feel the heat?

524
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,680
The neck.

525
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,340
Is your neck hard?

526
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,440
It's so good.

527
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,340
Is that so?

528
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,420
I feel good.

529
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,800
Do you feel good, Chimpanzee?

530
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:21,460
I feel good.

531
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,470
Why do you feel so good?

532
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,471
Are you okay?

533
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,650
Are you okay?

534
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,490
I'm scared.

535
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,850
I'm so scared.

536
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
I'm so scared.

537
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,230
I'm so scared.

538
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,070
I'm scared.

539
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:13,200
It's so warm.

540
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,260
It's so warm.

541
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:55,500
It feels good.

542
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,720
Ah, it feels so good.

543
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,720
Ah, it feels so good.

544
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:25,721
Wow, it's so hard.

545
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,360
It's a little bit hot.

546
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,260
It's so hot.

547
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,000
It's scary.

548
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:52,310
I can't do it anymore.

549
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,210
It's so hard.

550
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,990
I can't do it.

551
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,370
I can't do it anymore.

552
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,900
I feel sick.

553
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,160
I feel sick.

554
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,600
Let's go, let's go.

555
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,380
Let's go.

556
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,940
Let's go, let's go.

557
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,520
Let's do it again.

558
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,390
Thank you for your hard work.

559
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,270
Thank you for your hard work.

560
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,750
I'm going to finish it.

561
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,540
My neck is stiff.

562
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,580
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,540
I can't take it anymore.

564
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,900
I can't take it anymore.

565
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,320
I'm so tired.

566
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,900
I can't take it anymore.

567
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,380
It's so warm.

568
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,020
It's so warm.

569
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,180
Are you okay?

570
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,240
I can't do it.

571
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,241
I can't do it.

572
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,020
I can't do it.

573
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:56,410
I can't do it.

574
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,630
I'm so sorry.

575
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,810
Oh, my God.

576
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,210
Oh, my God.

577
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,460
I'm so sorry.

578
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:35,400
I feel so bad.

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,870
I'm sorry.

580
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,490
I'm sorry.

581
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,560
I'm so happy.

582
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,360
I'm so happy.

583
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,460
I'm so happy.

584
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,920
I'm sorry.

585
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,820
I'm sorry.

586
00:48:13,021 --> 00:48:14,021
I'm thirsty.

587
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,900
Oh, it's bitter.

588
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,030
How about me?

589
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,370
Let's Go sister!

590
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:43,510
Ouch ouch!

591
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:45,570
Ah!

592
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:45,810
Ah!

593
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,130
Ouch!

594
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,470
Ah!

595
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,110
Ouch!

596
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:57,570
Ouch!

597
00:49:57,571 --> 00:49:58,571
Already, already.

598
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,790
No more?

599
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,110
No more.

600
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,430
No more?

601
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
It's so hot!

602
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,160
It's so hot!

603
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,140
It's so hot!

604
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,990
Now, we've arrived at the inn.

605
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,790
Let's play the game!

606
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:00,510
The game we're going to
play is... Breast-sucking game!

607
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,150
Breast-sucking game!

608
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:05,210
That's right.

609
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,430
I'll explain the rules.

610
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:11,690
First of all, each team will
select one representative.

611
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:19,630
The representative will cover her
eyes and bite the person's boobs.

612
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,130
The game is to guess whose boobs it is.

613
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,610
If you guess whose boobs it is, you win.

614
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,590
If you don't, you lose.

615
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,130
If you win, you can enjoy
3 different hot Springs.

616
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,510
Choose your favorite course and enjoy!

617
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,590
If you lose, you have to
play a punishment game.

618
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,530
It's an erotic punishment game.

619
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,870
It's an erotic punishment game.

620
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,110
It's an erotic punishment game.

621
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,250
It's an erotic punishment game.

622
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:55,430
It's an erotic punishment game.

623
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:55,610
It's an erotic punishment game.

624
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:55,630
It's an erotic punishment game.

625
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:11,610
It's an erotic punishment game.

626
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:11,830
It's an erotic punishment game.

627
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:18,650
It's an erotic punishment game.

628
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:19,891
Let's do a 10-second countdown.

629
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:21,970
Ready, go!

630
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:22,830

Please take off your blindfolds.

646

I made a mistake.

647

She's cute.

648
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:06,120
The actress who made a
mistake will be standing like this.

649
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:09,460
So, I want you to sit as long as you can.

650

00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,420
I did it!

687
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,450
This is amazing.

688
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,210
She's beautiful.

689
00:54:47,211 --> 00:54:48,211
I'm sorry.

690
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:50,770
I got it.

691
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,750
Well, then...

692
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:59,320
Are you really going to stand up, Yomi-San?

693
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,160
Thank you very much.

694
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,460
Now, let's move on to the next round.

695
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:23,900
Ready, set... 10, 9,
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

696
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,360
Time's up!

697
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,080
It smelled so good.

698
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
No, it's the cheek.

699
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,760
Please tell us the answer.

700
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:35,780
I think I know what it is.

701
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,100
It's Tadayuka-San.

702
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,400
Tadayuka-San.

703
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,780
Please take off your blindfold.

704
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:41,861
Please take off your shoes.

705
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Oh, no.

706
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,960
I'm sorry.

707
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,020
10 seconds left.

708
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,350
I'm sorry.

709
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,160
I'm sorry.

710
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,970
We have 2,000 seconds left.

711
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:08,590
Let's get excited.

712
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,050
Ready?

713
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,250
10.

714
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,620
9.

715
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,130
8.

716
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:14,950
7.

717
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,950
6.

718
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
5.

719
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,760
Time's up!

720
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:26,380
Please give us your answer.

721
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,660
I'll go with Momoko Ishiki.

722
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,140
Please cover your eyes.

723
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:48,630
I'll go with Kiyosuke.

724
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,250
Welcome.

725
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:07,700
This is the last game!

726
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,340
Let's cheer up with a
loud voice until the end!

727
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,380
Ready?

728
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,600
10

729
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,720
9

730
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:15,740
8

731
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,620
7

732
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:17,700
6

733
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:18,480
5

734
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,440
4

735
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:20,200
3

736
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,080
2

737
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:21,960
1

738
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:23,280
Time's up!

739
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,340
I knew it!

740
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,700
Please give us the answer.

741
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,320
This is Ai Mukai.

742
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,710
Please take off your blindfold.

743
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,500
I knew it.

744
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,340
Congratulations.

745
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,760
I was a bit excited.

746
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
I felt good.

747
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,160
Thank you.

748
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:43,720
It's frustrating, but I'll do my best.

749
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,420
Congratulations.

750
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,960
I want to ask you to do it.

751
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,700
Now, the lucky chance
has come to Kiyotsuke team.

752
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
Yes.

753
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,980
You've been standing there carefully.

754
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:07,056
But one of the actresses who
is standing right now will have

755
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:11,360
to play rock-paper-scissors to
decide who will be on this team!

756
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,940
So, let's start the game!

757
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,540
Can I ask you to call out your name?

758
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,060
Let's start with Kuu.

759
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:31,280
After that, I'm going to go all out!

760
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,320
Psychological warfare!

761
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,460
I'm going to go all out, too!

762
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,840
I'm going to go all out, too.

763
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:43,740
Here we go.

764
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,260
Rock, paper, scissors!

765
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,660
That's how it is.

766
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,520
I'm going to go all out, too.

767
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:56,521
Yes.

768
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Yes.

769
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,300
Rock, paper, scissors!

770
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,180
Ichiro-San, Ichiro-San!

771
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:09,780
Ichiro-San!

772
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:11,160
Ichiro-San, what's going on?

773
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,100
Sorry, I'm sorry.

774
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,540
Ichiro-San!

775
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Ichiro-San!

776
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,480
Ichiro-San!

777
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,180
Ichiro-San!

778
00:59:25,181 --> 00:59:26,741
It's been a while since I've been here.

779
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,300
It's amazing.

780
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:29,980
It's amazing.

781
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,740
It's beautiful.

782
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,400
So, Kazama-San, are you okay?

783
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,060
Are you okay?

784
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,940
We've decided how we're
going to spend our time.

785
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,520
Everyone, please enjoy as much as you want.

786
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:57,720
It's nice.

787
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,080
Right?

788
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,300
It's comforting.

789
01:00:00,301 --> 01:00:01,301
They are so cute.

790
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,720
Because we won the game.

791
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,210
Excuse me.

792
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,470
May I join you?

793
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,710
May I?

794
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

795
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:34,570
Oh, I see.

796
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:40,490
It's a nice bath, isn't it?

797
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,870
Yes, it is.

798
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:43,890
Thank you very much.

799
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:45,830
It was a pleasure.

800
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,170
It's fast.

801
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,310
Oh, it's raining.

802
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,770
Let's eat.

803
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,770
It's delicious.

804
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:35,820
Is it salty?

805
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,920
It's salty.

806
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,480
It's so soft.

807
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,500
Oh, my God.

808
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,260
Amazing.

809
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,360
Oh, my God.

810
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,740
That's great.

811
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:10,840
I can't stop moving.

812
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,720
The river is amazing.

813
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,380
The river is so beautiful.

814
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:26,580
I'm on the edge of the river.

815
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:28,260
Ahhh.

816
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,180
Ahh It's so sweet.

817
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,380
Amazing.

818
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,860
You are going to have a baby.

819
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,240
What are you doing?

820
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,900
You are going to have a baby.

821
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:52,580
Wow.

822
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,400
The water is cold.

823
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:14,280
I'm afraid if I jump.

824
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,180
Look at that.

825
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:24,980
The water is cold.

826
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,110
It's cold.

827
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,880
It's hot.

828
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:34,881
I'll do my best.

829
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,700
It's hot.

830
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:40,100
It's hot.

831
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:41,220
Oh, my gosh.

832
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,260
It's hot.

833
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,060
It's hot.

834
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,880
Thank you for the meal.

835
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,820
It's delicious.

836
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,160
It's amazing.

837
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,780
It's amazing.

838
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,720
It's refreshing.

839
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,820
It feels so good.

840
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:14,080
I feel so happy.

841
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,540
I'm going to wash my face too.

842
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,700
Will you?

843
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,800
I'm not good at it.

844
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,380
I see.

845
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,700
I want to do that too.

846
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,060
Your face.

847
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,940
I'm not good at it.

848
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:45,480
I see.

849
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:47,960
It's so hot.

850
01:06:47,961 --> 01:06:48,961
Kiss me.

851
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,440
It's so hot.

852
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,260
It's so cool.

853
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,520
It's so cool.

854
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,760
I feel sick.

855
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Ah...

856
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,010
I'm sleepy.

857
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,260
I'm going to live an old life.

858
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,620
That's right.

859
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,800

860
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:13,940

862
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:26,080
oh oh.

863
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,720
oh oh.

864
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,220
oh.

865
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:34,761
oh oh oh oh It's warm.

866
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,840
It feels good.

867
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,570
That's great.

868
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:06,070
It feels good.

869
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,170
It feels good.

870
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,390
Thank you very much.

871
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:56,200
It's delicious.

872
01:10:56,201 --> 01:11:05,380
It's amazing.

873
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:11,700
It's amazing.

874
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,500
Oh, it's cold.

875
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,480
Oh, it's cold.

876
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,760
Oh, it's cold.

877
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,040
Oh, it's cold.

878
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,640
Oh, it's cold.

879
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,640
Oh, it's cold.

880
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,800
Oh, it's cold.

881
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:37,680
Oh, it's cold.

882
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,700
Oh, it's cold.

883
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,690
Oh, it's cold.

884
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:29,300
Oh, it's hot.

885
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,780
Oh, it's hot.

886
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:46,420
It's good.

887
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:14,900
Do you want to drink?

888
01:13:14,901 --> 01:13:15,000
Does it hurt?

889
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,560
Does it feel like a butt?

890
01:14:25,370 --> 01:15:42,190
Ma-kun, let me touch you.

891
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,890
Ma-kun, let me touch you.

892
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,510
More.

893
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,110
More.

894
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:52,440
I will protect you.

895
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,180
Thank you.

896
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:30,440
Thank you.

897
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:44,060
Ah, I fell down.

898
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,500
Oh, great.

899
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:19,260
Here, here.

900
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:20,660
Feeling good.

901
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,700
Oh, no.

902
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,940
Feeling good.

903
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:37,940
I will keep going down.

904
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:07,840
It's hot.

905
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:17,720
It's hot.

906
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,800
It's hot.

907
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It's hot.

908
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:29,680
I want to do more.

909
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,520
Yeah, you two do it.

910
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,220
Isn't it hot?

911
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:36,160
It's hot.

912
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:39,411
I can't believe it's over!

913
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,750
I'm so happy!

914
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:00,751
Oh, my God!

915
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:02,510
I'm so happy!

916
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:15,170
Oh, my God!

917
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:19,590
I'm so happy!

918
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,010
I'm so happy!

919
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:29,400
I'm so happy!

920
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,020
This is great!

921
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,910
Good job.

922
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:43,850
Good, good, good!

923
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:55,660
You did it, you did it, you did it!

924
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,900
I'm at a loss for words...

925
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,100
I'm here to save him.

926
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,320
I can't believe he's still in my arms.

927
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:59,260
I'm so happy my sister's going to save him.

928
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,340
I'm so happy I'm going to cry right now.

929
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:03,701
I can't believe I made it through.

930
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,170
I'm terrified I'll die in this place.

931
01:30:20,580 --> 01:31:07,230
I can't believe I can't move.

932
01:31:07,231 --> 01:31:07,250
I don't know if I can make it through.

933
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:08,251
I'm sorry.

934
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,910
I'm sorry.

935
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:29,270
I'm sorry.

936
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:56,070
I'm sorry.

937
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

938
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:36,800
It's all right.

939
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:41,720
I'll put it in, too.

940
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:05,570
I'll put it in, too.

941
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:32,000
I feel good, too.

942
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:33,660
Have more!

943
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,380
More!

944
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:59,770
I can't do this anymore.

945
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,950
One more!

946
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:02,530
No, one more!

947
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,390
Let's wait.

948
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:53,880
It feels so good.

949
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:18,400
It's hot.

950
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:22,460
I feel sick.

951
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:31,250
I feel sick.

952
01:36:49,970 --> 01:37:28,860
Oh, no.

953
01:37:28,861 --> 01:37:31,180
Thank you so much.

954
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,420
I want to go to the hot spring.

955
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,440
It's amazing.

956
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,400
What are they doing?

957
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
What should we do?

958
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:25,960
Can we go there?

959
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,920
It's amazing.

960
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:32,380
It's really fun.

961
01:39:32,381 --> 01:39:34,320
Wait a minute.

962
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,820
I'm sure it's fun.

963
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:39,520
Let's go.

964
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,320
It's amazing.

965
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,220
It's amazing.

966
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,040
It's different.

967
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,480
It's different.

968
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:49,940
It's different.

969
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,480
I'm going to take it off.

970
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:53,040
What?

971
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,960
I'm going to take it off.

972
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:57,940
Really?

973
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,860
Look.

974
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,940
I'm nervous.

975
01:40:03,941 --> 01:40:04,941
I'll go first.

976
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:07,320
Wait for me.

977
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,660
Let's go.

978
01:40:12,661 --> 01:40:14,280
I can't help it.

979
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,560
Let's go.

980
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Let's go together.

981
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,340
I can't go alone.

982
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,680
I'm shy.

983
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:27,680
I'm shy.

984
01:40:27,681 --> 01:40:28,681
I feel so embarassed.

985
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,660
I feel so embarrassed.

986
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,480
Let's get back in the game.

987
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:40,140
Still don't want to play?

988
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:41,141
Just a second.

989
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:42,300
I will get back in the game.

990
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,840
Oh, well.

991
01:40:46,841 --> 01:40:47,260
Please go back.

992
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,800
Feels good.

993
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,480
I'm nervous.

994
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:53,820
Here we go.

995
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,960
I don't want to go back.

996
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:03,640
It's hot.

997
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,480
It's hot.

998
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,440
It's hot.

999
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:12,800
It's hot.

1000
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,040
It's hot.

1001
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,300
It's deep?

1002
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:30,920
It seems to be a good way.

1003
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,580
Let's try it!

1004
01:41:35,581 --> 01:41:36,821
It's a great weather, isn't it?

1005
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:38,080
Yes.

1006
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:39,081
It's amazing.

1007
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:48,580
Let's do it together, everyone.

1008
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:49,800
Let's do it together!

1009
01:41:49,801 --> 01:41:50,801
Let's do it.

1010
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,740
It's getting bigger.

1011
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:21,100
It's amazing.

1012
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:27,680
The mother is grumbling.

1013
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:33,060
The mother is grumbling.

1014
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:42,500
She is grumbling a lot.

1015
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,840
I'm sorry.

1016
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,760
I'm sorry.

1017
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,960
I'm sorry.

1018
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,240
I'm sorry.

1019
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:54,241
I'm sorry.

1020
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,720
I'm sorry.

1021
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:57,560
I'm sorry.

1022
01:43:57,561 --> 01:43:58,561
I'm sorry.

1023
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:03,180
I'm sorry.

1024
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:03,940
I'm sorry.

1025
01:44:03,941 --> 01:44:04,941
I'm sorry.

1026
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,720
I'm sorry.

1027
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,920
I'm sorry.

1028
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,280
I'm sorry.

1029
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:17,060
It's so hot.

1030
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,440
I can't get up.

1031
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,680
I feel so hot.

1032

I'm sorry.

1204
02:09:29,801 --> 02:09:30,801
I can't do it.

1205
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:09,110
I can't do it.

1206
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:13,510
Thank you very much.

1207
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:07,070
I'm sorry.

1208
02:11:18,810 --> 02:11:36,540
It hurts.

1209
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,760
I'm sorry.

1210
02:12:31,270 --> 02:12:38,320
Oh, my God!

1211
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:39,940
I'm going to cry.

1212
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,480
I'm sorry.

1213
02:12:55,420 --> 02:12:56,420
I'm sorry.

1214
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:58,470
Oh, my God.

1215
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:53,696
They both keep staring at the baby.

1216
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:55,100
Ahhh...

1217
02:14:26,830 --> 02:14:27,850
Baby barely stands up...

1218
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:32,771
Baby keeps looking up...
Baby keeps looking down...

1219
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:35,290
Looking up again...

1220
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:40,511
Baby keeps looking up...
The baby wants to stand up...

1221
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:59,750
I'm sorry.

1222
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:10,950
I'm sorry.

1223
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:12,090
I'm sorry.

1224
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:33,910
I'm scared.

1225
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:36,410
I'm scared.

1226
02:15:36,411 --> 02:15:37,411
I'm scared.

1227
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:41,510
I'm scared.

1228
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:54,490
I'm scared.

1229
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:21,170
Nice!

1230
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:22,650
That's it!

1231
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:39,460
That feels so good!

1232
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:55,350
Uh-huh.

1233
02:17:56,790 --> 02:17:57,790
Ah.

1234
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:21,520
Eh?

1235
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:24,060
Ah.

1236
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:28,830
Ah.

1237
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:37,900
It looks painful.

1238
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:39,490
Ah.

1239
02:18:39,860 --> 02:19:05,760
Does this hurt?

1240
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:09,580
Ah.

1241
02:19:22,190 --> 02:19:24,010
I'm starting to sweat.

1242
02:19:24,011 --> 02:19:25,011
It's almost done.

1243
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:38,920
It's bleeding a lot.

1244
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:41,100
It's bleeding a lot.

1245
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:46,100
It's amazing.

1246
02:20:51,070 --> 02:20:53,140
I want to go further and go on.

1247
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:51,520
Oh!

1248
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:54,380
Oh!

1249
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:55,660
Oh!

1250
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:56,440
Oh!

1251
02:21:56,441 --> 02:21:57,441
Oh!

1252
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:02,960
Oh!

1253
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:20,720
I'm sorry.

1254
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:04,130
I'm sorry.

1255
02:23:04,310 --> 02:23:05,310
I'm sorry.

1256
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:26,070
Thank you very much.

1257
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:27,250
Thank you very much.

1258
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:28,590
Thank you very much.

1259
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:01,150
Don't do that.

1260
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,520
It's cold.

1261
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:27,580
It's dangerous.

1262
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:08,650
It's cold.

1263
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:10,170
I think I can do it.

1264
02:25:10,730 --> 02:25:11,730
I think I can do it.

1265
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:15,310
I can do it.

1266
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:16,770
I can do it.

1267
02:25:16,771 --> 02:25:17,771
Oh, no.

1268
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:35,600
I'm going to die.

1269
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:37,840
I'm going to die, too.

1270
02:26:53,095 --> 02:27:02,560
I'm so weak!

1271
02:27:02,561 --> 02:27:04,440
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

1272
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:16,840
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

1273
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:26,620
Give me a lot of energy.

1274
02:27:26,621 --> 02:27:27,621
What should I do?

1275
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:23,520
I can't breathe.

1276
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:31,080
I can't breathe.

1277
02:28:54,460 --> 02:29:03,830
I'm going to have a hard time
if I don't go to the bathroom.

1278
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,130
I'm not going to go to the bathroom.

1279
02:29:12,130 --> 02:29:14,120
I'm getting tired.

1280
02:29:16,395 --> 02:29:22,040
After a while, the women
are going to the bathroom.

1281
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:23,240
I'm back.

1282
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:24,860
I'm back.

1283

Thank you very much.

1301
02:30:30,021 --> 02:30:31,021
Amazing!

1302
02:30:33,690 --> 02:30:35,160
You drink quite a lot, don't you?

1303
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:36,500
No, I don't drink much.

1304
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:40,120
But it's easy to drink.

1305
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,360
How is it?

1306
02:30:46,830 --> 02:30:48,120
It's good.

1307
02:30:55,900 --> 02:30:58,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1308
02:31:00,020 --> 02:31:01,020
Give it to me.

1309
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:09,400
It's delicious, right?

1310
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:18,040
Your lips are so soft.

1311
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:36,880
I'm so excited.

1312
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:46,080

I'm so excited.

1314
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:31,440
Mini cheese.

1315
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:40,640
My boobs are going to explode.

1316
02:32:42,990 --> 02:32:44,240
I'm going to cry.

1317
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:51,781
My boobs are going
to explode Oh, it's hot.

1318

Wow, it's getting harder and harder.

1319
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:13,060
Oh, no.

1320
02:33:13,210 --> 02:33:21,340
I can't see anything
with my eyes and mouth.

1321
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:24,100
I can't see anything.

1322
02:33:24,900 --> 02:33:27,540
It's a miracle.

1323
02:33:28,820 --> 02:33:32,000
Give me another kiss.

Good boy.

You shouldn't be patient.

1330

Drink it.

1331

It's hot.

1354
02:36:12,020 --> 02:36:13,020
Who is special?

1355
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:13,680
This is a big one.

1356
02:36:13,681 --> 02:36:14,681
I wonder if it's a plane?

1357
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:17,840
Here is the plane.

1358
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:29,860

I don't want that.

1372
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:27,520
You can't do that.

1373
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,080
You're cute.

1374
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:34,660
It looks delicious.

1375
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:38,320
I'm sorry.

1376
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:43,520
Let's take a look at the photo of the baby.

1377
02:37:44,070 --> 02:37:45,070
She is so cute.

1378
02:37:49,410 --> 02:37:50,880
She is very comfortable.

1379
02:37:52,320 --> 02:37:53,940
She is very gentle.

1380
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:55,620
She is very good.

1381
02:37:57,140 --> 02:38:07,200
She looks like she was born.

1382
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:08,740
She looks like she was born.

1383
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:13,300
Do you want me to hold you?

1384
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:14,780
Do you want me to hold you?

1385
02:38:16,540 --> 02:38:18,260
Look at me.

1386
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,640
Look at me.

1387
02:38:24,560 --> 02:38:25,560
Wow.

1388
02:38:26,280 --> 02:38:28,760
Do you want me to hold you?

1389
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:32,260
It feels good.

1390
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,520
You are so big.

1391
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:38,680
It feels good.

1392
02:38:38,681 --> 02:38:39,820
Please go ahead.

1393
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:45,700
Oruchan Are you
covering your eyes?

1394
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:47,500
Did you cover your eyes?

1395
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:51,520
You covered your eyes, didn't you.

1396
02:38:51,521 --> 02:38:59,120
Oh my! She's going out.

1397
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,420
You can't follow her.

1398
02:39:01,421 --> 02:39:02,360
Don't go there.

1399
02:39:02,361 --> 02:39:03,780
She is going there.

1400
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:07,520
Don't go there.

1401
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:08,100
Don't go there.

1402
02:39:08,101 --> 02:39:09,101
Don't do that.

1403
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:14,700
She is taking a rest.

1404
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:16,460
I feel so good.

1405
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:18,700
Open your chest.

1406
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,520
Where is your chest?

1407
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:21,920
Here?

1408
02:39:22,970 --> 02:39:24,520
Yes, here.

1409
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:27,700
There is a lot of chest.

1410
02:39:28,420 --> 02:39:31,400
There is a lot of chest.

1411
02:39:31,401 --> 02:39:32,401
I'm going to lick you.

1412
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,240
Does it feel good?

1413
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,660
Frankfurt is good.

1414
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:49,680
It's like a cake.

1415
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:07,120
This is a special one for you.

1416
02:41:07,140 --> 02:41:07,260
Thank you.

1417
02:41:07,261 --> 02:41:08,261
I'm a little nervous.

1418
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:09,720
I'm nervous.

1419
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:12,880
It's a special one.

1420
02:41:12,881 --> 02:41:14,040
I'm nervous.

1421
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:24,560
It's delicious.

1422
02:41:25,060 --> 02:41:25,760
It's delicious.

1423
02:41:25,761 --> 02:41:26,761
It's delicious.

1424
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:29,560
Drink it with a cup.

1425
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:45,340
It feels good.

1426
02:42:06,150 --> 02:42:07,930
He is calm.

1427
02:42:08,390 --> 02:42:09,390
He is calm.

1428
02:42:14,170 --> 02:42:15,170
That's scary.

1429
02:42:29,870 --> 02:42:30,870
It's like a zombie.

1430
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:49,400
It's a zombie.

1431
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:52,380
A zombie.

1432
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:53,480
A zombie.

1433
02:42:53,481 --> 02:42:55,121
But, I can make a different kind of face.

1434
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:57,700
You can make a different kind of face.

1435
02:42:57,701 --> 02:42:58,701
It's coming out.

1436
02:42:58,780 --> 02:43:00,740
Does it feel good?

1437
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:02,940
It feels good.

1438
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:37,940
Don't do that.

1439
02:43:38,980 --> 02:43:40,300
Don't do that.

1440
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:44,880
Do you have a cold?

1441
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:46,580
I am fine.

1442
02:43:46,700 --> 02:43:47,700
I am fine.

1443
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:50,900
This is our special sake.

1444
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,180
This is our special sake.

I feel sorry for you.

1447
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:58,600
I feel sorry for you.

1448
02:44:00,180 --> 02:44:02,660
This is our special sake.

1449
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:04,800
Please try it.

1450
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,260
What is it?

1451
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:36,800
It's cute.

1452
02:44:37,420 --> 02:44:38,880
It's so cute.

1453
02:44:40,460 --> 02:44:41,460
It's so cute.

1454
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:43,100
Don't give it.

1455
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:46,440
Don't give it.

1456
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:48,080
Don't give it.

1457

It's so cute.

1459

Put it in.

1465
02:45:01,460 --> 02:45:02,460
Wow, you're amazing.

1466
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:04,200
Then I'll put it in my mouth.

1467
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,040
It's not fair!

1468
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:09,620
I'm happy.

1469
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:12,480
No, no.

1470
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:16,540
I can't do this!

1471
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:19,200
I want to put it in, too.

1472
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:20,860
I'll put it in.

1473
02:45:20,861 --> 02:45:22,160
I'm sorry.

1474
02:45:50,860 --> 02:45:53,740

I'm scared!

1482
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:33,730
No!

1483
02:47:33,731 --> 02:47:34,731
I almost died!

1484
02:47:34,770 --> 02:47:36,190
Please let me go!

1485
02:47:36,630 --> 02:47:37,130

1491
02:47:51,190 --> 02:47:53,911
Oh, my child Oh, my
child What a shame.

1492
02:47:55,050 --> 02:47:57,950
Oh, my child Oh, no!

1493
02:48:25,690 --> 02:48:26,930
Let's do it one more time.

1494
02:48:28,010 --> 02:48:29,010
What should I do?

1495
02:48:32,630 --> 02:48:34,670
This is for Ai-chan.

1496
02:48:34,990 --> 02:48:35,990
This is for me.

1497
02:48:45,970 --> 02:48:49,090
It feels good.

1498
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:34,730
I feel sick.

1499
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:40,570
I'm sick.

1500
02:49:42,250 --> 02:49:44,110

It's hard.

1510
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:28,260
I feel sick.

1511
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:35,480
I'm tired.

1512
02:51:35,481 --> 02:51:36,620
Let's push him over there!

1513
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:39,180
Let's push him over there!

1514
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:45,900
Push him more!

More! More!

1516
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:52,380
Push him more!

02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:26,460
I'm so happy.

1545
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:29,040
When dad is at work,

1546
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:34,140
I feel like I can go back
to my old haunted house.

1547
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:37,140
I'm so happy.

1548
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:40,760
I'm so happy.

1549
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:47,880
I feel so good.

1550
02:55:20,320 --> 02:55:21,320
It's a joke.

1551
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:27,960
I'm sweating.

1552
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:48,320
It's a joke.

1553
02:55:48,321 --> 02:55:49,400
It's wrong. It's wrong.

1554
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:50,920
It's right.

1555
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:07,800
Don't go out.

1556
02:56:07,801 --> 02:56:10,320
Oh, it stung!

1557
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:11,400
Give him some water.

1558
02:56:11,401 --> 02:56:11,640
Oh, gosh.

1559
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:12,880
Oh.

1560
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:14,240
Ah!

1561
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:20,800
I'll give him some water.

1562
02:56:20,801 --> 02:56:20,900
Ah!

1563
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:21,920
Ah!

1564
02:56:22,540 --> 02:56:23,540
Oh.

1565
02:56:25,880 --> 02:56:26,880
Stop!

1566
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:27,440
Stop!

1567
02:56:27,441 --> 02:56:28,740
Stop, Stop, Stop!

1568
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:30,060
I'll give him some water.

1569
02:56:30,500 --> 02:56:31,500
Oh.

1570
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:33,100
Oh.

1571
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:34,320
Stop, Stop, Stop!

1572
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:35,680
Stop, Stop, Stop!

1573
02:56:35,681 --> 02:56:37,080
Thank you very much.

1574
02:56:37,740 --> 02:56:41,920
Thank you very much.

1575
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:13,160
What's going on?

1576
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:41,880
This is the biggest fight yet!

1577
02:57:41,881 --> 02:57:43,960
It's so fast!

1578
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:12,880
Oh, it hurts.

1579
02:58:15,260 --> 02:58:16,260
Oh, it hurts.

1580
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:17,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah a male

1581
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:21,960
Oh, my goodness.

1582
02:59:21,961 --> 02:59:22,920
Oh, my goodness.

1583
02:59:22,921 --> 02:59:25,040
Oh, my goodness.

1584
02:59:41,470 --> 02:59:59,890
Please line up in a row.

1585
03:00:08,730 --> 03:00:10,670
Look at this.

1586
03:00:15,430 --> 03:00:16,430
Oh, my God!

1587
03:00:18,150 --> 03:00:21,730
Oh, I'm so happy!

1588
03:00:23,310 --> 03:00:26,210
You're so cute!

1589
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:27,930
You're so cute.

1590
03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:32,910
You're so cute.

1591
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:44,820
You're so cute!

1592
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:54,260
Oh, my God.

1593
03:00:57,360 --> 03:00:58,360
It's hot.

1594
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:08,840
It's so hot.

1595
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:25,100
It's so hot.

1596
03:01:28,060 --> 03:01:30,660
It's so hot.

1597
03:01:36,830 --> 03:01:37,830
Oh, my God.

1598
03:01:39,810 --> 03:01:42,150
Let's go together.

1599
03:01:45,350 --> 03:01:47,270
Oh, my God.

1600
03:02:19,140 --> 03:02:21,020
I'm going to fall.

1601
03:02:21,021 --> 03:02:22,100
I can't take it anymore.

1602
03:02:29,720 --> 03:02:39,760
I can't take it anymore.

1603
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:51,140
I can't take it anymore.

1604
03:02:55,940 --> 03:02:59,120
I can't take it anymore.

1605
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:00,700
I can't take it anymore.

1606
03:03:12,185 --> 03:03:17,890
It's so hard!

1607
03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:19,870
It's so hard!

1608
03:03:21,770 --> 03:03:23,010
It's so hard!

1609
03:03:23,670 --> 03:03:25,550
It's so hard!

1610
03:03:37,430 --> 03:03:39,050
Are you going to do it again?

1611
03:03:40,490 --> 03:03:41,490
It's so hard!

1612
03:03:49,890 --> 03:03:51,810
However, I miss Mimmy's voice very much.

1613
03:03:51,811 --> 03:03:52,811
You are OK?

1614
03:03:58,950 --> 03:04:02,250
We can bring out as much as we need.

1615
03:04:03,470 --> 03:04:09,370
My life is full of stress.

1616
03:04:09,371 --> 03:04:14,930
Why is it so hard to make a video?

1617
03:04:17,210 --> 03:04:18,690
Oh my, oh my!

1618
03:04:20,110 --> 03:04:21,510
The baby is coming out.

1619
03:04:21,710 --> 03:04:23,310
There are many of baby in the baby body!

1620
03:04:23,570 --> 03:04:25,050
There are many baby in the baby body!

1621
03:04:25,550 --> 03:04:26,550
Wow!

1622
03:04:27,830 --> 03:04:29,410
Lots and lots!

1623
03:04:33,190 --> 03:04:35,390
I'm so happy!

1624
03:04:44,930 --> 03:04:46,670
I missed you!

1625
03:04:51,030 --> 03:05:14,881
I missed you... I
missed you... Kano-chan!

1626
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:16,540
Kano-chan!

1627
03:05:17,140 --> 03:05:18,480
Oh my! Oh...

1628
03:05:20,340 --> 03:05:22,800
I'm going to throw up!

1629
03:05:25,320 --> 03:05:27,040
This is not good! I can't take it anymore!

1630
03:05:28,540 --> 03:05:29,260
Not good!

1631
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:30,400
One more time!

1632
03:05:31,320 --> 03:05:35,660
Kano-chan is amazing!

1633
03:05:37,020 --> 03:05:38,860
He's very chubby!

1634
03:05:38,861 --> 03:05:38,980
Wow!

1635
03:05:39,260 --> 03:05:40,260
Wow!

1636
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:49,280
Thank you!

1637
03:05:52,780 --> 03:05:53,780
Thank you for loving me!

Thank you!

1642
03:06:18,460 --> 03:06:19,460
Thank you!

1643
03:06:19,720 --> 03:06:20,720
Thank you!

1644
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:24,380
Thank you!

1645
03:06:24,381 --> 03:06:25,920
She's having fun, so let's go.

1646
03:06:25,921 --> 03:06:26,921
It's so cute.

1647
03:06:28,040 --> 03:06:29,040
Come in.

1648
03:06:30,500 --> 03:06:31,500

03:06:36,301 --> 03:06:37,720
Let's take a picture together.

1652
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:41,120
It's so cute.

1653
03:06:42,340 --> 03:06:43,340
It's so cute.

1654
03:06:44,100 --> 03:06:45,100
It's so cute.

1655
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:48,340
It's so cute.

1656
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:50,100
Thank you for your hard work.

1657
03:06:50,101 --> 03:06:51,101
I'm going to imitate you.

1658
03:07:29,580 --> 03:07:31,300
It looks delicious.

1659
03:07:33,520 --> 03:07:55,240
Please call me again.

1660
03:07:57,520 --> 03:08:53,740
Let's have a drink together.

1661
03:09:15,010 --> 03:09:23,810
I'm a baby farmer.

1662
03:09:26,130 --> 03:09:45,040
I'm still here.

1663
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:46,420
I want to join you.

1664
03:11:32,460 --> 03:12:51,990
and so, with that... The BAAM
project has come to an end.

1665
03:13:27,820 --> 03:13:28,820
Thank you very much!

1666
03:14:18,740 --> 03:14:19,500
Good job!!

1667
03:14:19,501 --> 03:14:38,660
STAFF How was it?

1668
03:14:38,661 --> 03:15:09,240
I wish I had another opportunity!!

1669
03:15:09,241 --> 03:15:14,370
STAFF Like the magical bar... All I
have to do is go in and out of Dylan.

1670
03:15:14,371 --> 03:15:38,930
I wanted to have one though!

1671
03:15:41,410 --> 03:15:50,990
The water is so cold!!

1672
03:16:08,200 --> 03:16:09,000
Why are you taking a bath?

1673
03:16:09,180 --> 03:16:29,260
Why are you taking a bath?

1674
03:16:29,261 --> 03:16:31,780
You don't have to do this... You
don't have to do this... No way!

1675
03:16:31,781 --> 03:16:31,980
No way!

1676
03:16:31,981 --> 03:16:32,981
No way!

1677
03:16:33,380 --> 03:16:34,980
No way!

1678
03:16:35,060 --> 03:16:36,060
This is unbelievable!

1679
03:16:36,600 --> 03:16:37,900
This is unbelievable!

1680
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:57,700
Can you hear me?

1681
03:16:57,701 --> 03:17:04,180
Everyone! Let's take a bath together!

1682
03:17:48,080 --> 03:18:03,180
It's so good!

1683
03:19:03,100 --> 03:19:18,360
It's so cool!

1684
03:22:44,060 --> 03:22:46,200
The zookeeper is very kind.

1685
03:23:25,250 --> 03:23:40,480
This is the first time I've ever seen
such a large number of children.

1686
03:26:13,860 --> 03:26:15,460
I was surprised to see so many children.

1687
03:26:25,530 --> 03:26:35,430
It's a lot of fun!

1688
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:03,200
I can't do it.

1689
03:29:12,700 --> 03:29:13,700
I can't do it.

1690
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:15,500
I can't do it.

1691
03:31:38,140 --> 03:31:44,110
Kana-chan!

1692
03:32:36,660 --> 03:32:39,340
Take this slice for me!!!!

1693
03:32:40,560 --> 03:32:42,541
Ohhhhhh Oh, it's going to break.

1694
03:32:42,760 --> 03:32:44,480
Oh, it's going to break.

1695
03:33:14,480 --> 03:33:16,280
Daddy, I'm going to eat it!

1696
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:46,560
Can I put it inside?

1697
03:33:49,220 --> 03:33:50,300
I'll put it inside.

1698
03:34:28,640 --> 03:34:31,620
Wait, wait, wait.

1699
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:54,040
I can't hold it anymore.

1700
03:34:54,980 --> 03:34:55,980
Not yet.

1701
03:34:56,210 --> 03:34:56,980
Not yet?

1702
03:34:56,981 --> 03:34:57,981
How is it?

1703
03:34:58,660 --> 03:34:59,820
I can't do it!

1704
03:35:00,900 --> 03:35:01,900
I can't do it!

1705
03:35:05,240 --> 03:35:06,760
Oh, no!

1706
03:35:10,620 --> 03:35:11,620
Oh, my God!

1707
03:35:12,340 --> 03:35:15,420
Oh, my God!

1708
03:35:17,780 --> 03:35:18,780
I can't do it!

1709
03:35:19,220 --> 03:35:20,220
I can't do it!

1710
03:35:28,620 --> 03:35:30,020
It was very good.

1711
03:35:30,420 --> 03:35:31,420
I can't do it!

1712
03:36:07,520 --> 03:36:10,540
Oh, it hurts.

1713
03:36:27,120 --> 03:36:31,600
Oh, it feels good.

1714
03:36:47,680 --> 03:37:07,440
It's so hot.

1715
03:37:42,200 --> 03:37:43,300
It's so hot.

1716
03:37:43,301 --> 03:37:44,301
It's so hot.

1717
03:37:58,420 --> 03:38:06,290
It's so hot.

1718
03:38:07,730 --> 03:38:08,730
Oh, it's hot.

1719
03:38:16,030 --> 03:38:18,450
Oh, it's hot.

1720
03:38:59,360 --> 03:39:00,360
I'm so happy!

1721
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:11,120
I'm so happy!

1722
03:40:28,911 --> 03:40:29,911
Both hands.

1723
03:41:11,220 --> 03:41:17,840
I want more.

1724
03:41:30,880 --> 03:41:31,880
I want more.

1725
03:42:40,110 --> 03:42:44,170
...

1726
03:42:45,830 --> 03:42:49,890
...

1727
03:43:07,560 --> 03:43:16,431
... ... ...

1728
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:53,720
I'm so sorry.

1729
03:43:54,040 --> 03:43:55,040
I'm so sorry.

1730
03:43:57,380 --> 03:43:58,380
I'm so sorry.

1731
03:44:39,520 --> 03:44:40,760
I feel...

1732
03:44:40,910 --> 03:44:42,700
I feel so weird!

1733
03:45:20,400 --> 03:45:22,940
I don't know what to do!

1734
03:45:26,960 --> 03:45:35,460
Are they connected?

1735
03:45:36,400 --> 03:45:37,660
Yes, they are.

1736
03:45:38,420 --> 03:45:41,620
I feel like... I'm
getting used to it.

1737
03:45:41,621 --> 03:45:43,181
It's the first time for me to touch it.

1738
03:45:43,570 --> 03:45:44,840
It's the first time for me to do it.

1739
03:45:44,841 --> 03:45:57,660
It's open! It's open!

1740
03:45:58,340 --> 03:46:56,420
It's open! It's open!

1741
03:46:56,421 --> 03:46:57,421
More?

1742
03:46:57,610 --> 03:46:58,610
Wow!

1743
03:47:00,160 --> 03:47:02,680
It's too much!

1744
03:47:08,960 --> 03:47:32,960
It's too much!

1745
03:47:35,800 --> 03:47:46,330
It's too much!

1746
03:48:08,660 --> 03:48:10,440
I'm scared.

1747
03:48:31,880 --> 03:48:32,880
I'm scared.

1748
03:49:23,070 --> 03:49:25,070
Hello.

1749
03:49:27,190 --> 03:49:28,190
Hello.

1750
03:49:29,090 --> 03:49:30,770
Hello.

1751
03:49:32,210 --> 03:49:33,890
Hello.

1752
03:49:34,030 --> 03:49:35,030
Hello.

1753
03:49:43,030 --> 03:49:47,790
I'm so happy to see you all here.

1754
03:50:17,790 --> 03:50:18,790
Ai.

1755
03:50:46,360 --> 03:50:47,060
Wow.

1756
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:48,280
It's awesome.

1757
03:50:49,020 --> 03:50:50,020
Ai.

1758
03:50:51,630 --> 03:50:52,120
Wow.

1759
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:53,160
Ai.

1760
03:51:36,760 --> 03:51:38,180
I'm sorry.

1761
03:52:21,050 --> 03:52:24,290
I'm so marvelous.

1762
03:52:24,291 --> 03:52:29,150
I'm so wonderful.

1763
03:52:29,170 --> 03:52:38,790
I'm so wonderful.

1764
03:52:57,770 --> 03:52:59,550
I'm so wonderful.

1765
03:55:19,580 --> 03:55:21,980
I was surprised to see how
many times I had to do it.

1766
03:55:59,990 --> 03:56:02,030
It was hard for me to see the next step.

1767
03:56:02,031 --> 03:56:03,492
I was surprised to see
how many times I had to do

1768
03:56:03,504 --> 03:56:04,916
it, and I was looking
forward to the next step.

1769
03:56:04,940 --> 03:56:16,160
9.5 times.

1770
03:56:17,360 --> 03:56:18,200
I was surprised to see that I was
doing it for the first time in my life.

1771
03:56:18,201 --> 03:56:19,201
Oh!

1772
03:56:23,650 --> 03:56:24,650
You did it!

1773
03:56:44,110 --> 03:56:45,120
You are a pervert.

1774
03:57:08,940 --> 03:57:09,940
You can do it!

1775
03:58:09,050 --> 03:58:14,770
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1776
03:58:50,060 --> 03:59:16,350
I am going to do it.

1777
03:59:18,070 --> 03:59:19,070
I am going to do it.

1778
03:59:19,430 --> 03:59:20,590
I am going to do it.

1779
03:59:20,591 --> 03:59:21,591
I did it!

1780
03:59:28,890 --> 03:59:32,290
Leave it to me, Mr. Motodana!

1781
03:59:37,460 --> 03:59:38,590
Wow!

1782
03:59:53,970 --> 03:59:54,970
Thank you so much!

1783
03:59:55,050 --> 03:59:56,050
Wow!

1784
03:59:58,830 --> 03:59:59,830
I'm so excited.

1785
04:00:04,030 --> 04:00:05,610
It feels so good.

1786
04:00:06,430 --> 04:00:16,690
I want to kiss you.

1787
04:00:25,230 --> 04:00:26,530
Oh, my God.

1788
04:00:27,130 --> 04:00:27,830
Oh, my God.

1789
04:00:27,831 --> 04:00:29,070
I love it, so please do a lot.

1790
04:00:29,690 --> 04:00:30,690
I'm doing it.

1791
04:00:33,570 --> 04:00:34,870
It feels good.

1792
04:00:39,110 --> 04:00:40,310
Oh, my God.

1793
04:00:40,730 --> 04:00:41,730
Oh, my God.

1794
04:00:47,410 --> 04:00:48,410
Wow!

1795
04:01:00,070 --> 04:01:05,740
Oh, my God.

1796
04:01:05,741 --> 04:01:06,780
You're so cool!

1797
04:01:07,200 --> 04:01:07,440
Thank you.

1798
04:01:07,640 --> 04:01:08,640
You're so cool!

1799
04:01:11,390 --> 04:01:12,910
You're so cool!

1800
04:01:19,370 --> 04:01:22,170
One more time!

1801
04:01:26,550 --> 04:01:27,550
Ouch!

1802
04:01:37,110 --> 04:01:42,470
Ah, it's hot.

1803

Thank you.

1804
04:02:21,540 --> 04:02:22,860
It's cold.

1805
04:02:34,130 --> 04:02:35,900
It feels so good.

1806
04:02:38,800 --> 04:02:41,200
It feels so good.

1807
04:02:57,060 --> 04:03:00,360
I'm so happy.

1808
04:03:00,500 --> 04:03:01,500
Congratulations!

1809
04:03:30,730 --> 04:03:31,830

Congratulations!

1815
04:04:43,020 --> 04:04:44,740
I'm going to cry.

1816
04:05:35,320 --> 04:05:36,320
So cool!

1817
04:06:28,810 --> 04:06:42,790
I'm going to play
with you I'm scared.

1818
04:07:12,000 --> 04:07:13,000
It's so good!

1819
04:07:13,700 --> 04:07:14,720
Feels good!

1820
04:08:36,250 --> 04:08:38,350
Thank you very much.

1821
04:09:07,290 --> 04:09:08,870
I feel so good.

1822
04:09:10,010 --> 04:09:11,010
I feel so good.

1823
04:09:11,420 --> 04:09:13,510
Wait a minute.

1824
04:09:17,870 --> 04:09:37,640
I feel so good.

1825
04:09:38,920 --> 04:09:40,220
I feel so good.

1826
04:09:40,221 --> 04:09:46,160
It's so hot.

1827
04:09:50,200 --> 04:09:51,860
It's so hot.

1828
04:09:51,861 --> 04:09:52,861
It feels so good.

1829
04:09:53,740 --> 04:10:02,710
It feels so good.

1830
04:10:04,710 --> 04:10:05,710
It feels so good.

1831
04:10:07,070 --> 04:10:12,410
Oh, no.

1832
04:10:12,411 --> 04:10:13,411

Hurry up!

1835
04:10:20,030 --> 04:10:28,610
Did you do it on your own?

1836
04:10:29,150 --> 04:10:30,150
Yes!

1837
04:10:31,870 --> 04:10:32,570

1838
04:10:32,850 --> 04:10:33,850

Oh, my God.

1848
04:11:20,501 --> 04:11:21,501
What's going on?

1849
04:11:21,820 --> 04:11:23,760
Oh, my God.

1850
04:11:23,761 --> 04:11:42,740
More, more.

1851
04:11:44,000 --> 04:11:45,160
More, more.

1852
04:11:46,640 --> 04:11:48,300
More, more.

1853
04:11:49,380 --> 04:11:51,840
More, more.

1854
04:12:11,670 --> 04:12:16,020
Madonna is the best!

1855
04:12:40,900 --> 04:12:41,900
I'm so happy.

1856
04:12:50,160 --> 04:12:51,600
Thank you.

1857
04:13:07,830 --> 04:13:09,690
I'm sorry.

1858
04:13:27,040 --> 04:13:40,810
I want you to hold Genki.

1859
04:13:51,830 --> 04:13:53,280
I feel good.

1860
04:14:11,540 --> 04:14:19,750
Move Genki.

1861
04:14:19,751 --> 04:14:21,230
Let's move a lot.

1862
04:14:38,640 --> 04:14:53,840
Do you want it?

1863
04:14:55,000 --> 04:15:04,460
Congratulations on the
20th anniversary of Madonna!

1864
04:15:27,470 --> 04:15:28,690
I got a neck sprain.

1865
04:16:00,740 --> 04:16:02,020
Can I hold it?

1866
04:16:04,160 --> 04:16:09,880
Oh my god.

1867
04:17:04,250 --> 04:17:19,270
Did you go to many places?

1868
04:17:19,271 --> 04:17:20,271
Did you have fun?

1869
04:17:20,670 --> 04:17:21,670
Yes!

1870
04:17:24,215 --> 04:17:25,440
Did you have fun?

1871
04:17:26,400 --> 04:17:27,400
Yes!

1872
04:17:29,090 --> 04:17:30,640
We will continue tomorrow!

1873
04:17:40,475 --> 04:17:41,475
Are you ready?

1874
04:17:41,520 --> 04:17:42,520
Yes!

1875
04:17:42,780 --> 04:17:45,500
We will start now!

1876
04:17:46,520 --> 04:17:47,860
Let's go!

1877
04:18:07,180 --> 04:18:08,180
What's wrong?

1878
04:18:08,320 --> 04:18:09,320
What's the matter?

1879
04:18:10,140 --> 04:18:11,360
What's wrong?

1880
04:18:12,840 --> 04:18:13,840
What are you doing?

1881
04:18:15,880 --> 04:18:17,080
Are you hurt?

1882
04:18:17,081 --> 04:18:18,081
Do you still have pain?

1883
04:18:21,480 --> 04:18:22,480
It's okay?

1884
04:18:23,080 --> 04:18:23,800
It's okay?

1885
04:18:23,801 --> 04:18:25,600
It's okay, I can't do it anymore.

1886
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:28,720
You can do it.

1887
04:18:28,721 --> 04:18:30,380
It's coming out.

1888
04:18:30,880 --> 04:18:33,160
It's coming out.

1889
04:18:33,390 --> 04:18:34,390
It's coming out.

1890
04:18:35,580 --> 04:18:36,440
It's coming out.

1891
04:18:36,441 --> 04:18:37,880
What are you doing?

1892
04:18:38,410 --> 04:18:39,420
Are you OK?

1893
04:18:40,020 --> 04:18:41,020
Are you going to sleep?

1894
04:18:41,460 --> 04:18:42,460
No, I was sleeping.

1895
04:18:44,630 --> 04:18:45,660
It's enough.

1896
04:18:47,620 --> 04:18:52,160
It's delicious.

1897
04:18:58,720 --> 04:19:00,380
She's a good girl.

1898
04:19:02,160 --> 04:19:03,660
She's smiling.

1899
04:19:07,080 --> 04:19:15,500
She's so cute.

1900
04:19:15,501 --> 04:19:16,501
It's so cute!

1901
04:19:19,620 --> 04:19:25,140
It's so good!

1902
04:19:31,430 --> 04:19:33,980
Is it good?

1903
04:19:35,400 --> 04:19:35,720
It's so good!

1904
04:19:35,940 --> 04:19:36,940
Let's eat!

1905
04:19:47,860 --> 04:19:55,020
They can't stop laughing and playing.

1906
04:20:17,000 --> 04:20:19,600
I'm going to take care of him.

1907
04:20:36,260 --> 04:20:39,600
I want to take care of your grandpa, too.

1908
04:20:39,640 --> 04:20:39,760
Ah!

1909
04:20:39,761 --> 04:20:40,761
Ah!

1910
04:20:42,480 --> 04:20:43,760
Grandpa is alive!

1911
04:20:44,240 --> 04:20:44,280
Ah!

1912
04:20:44,820 --> 04:20:45,820
Ah!

1913
04:20:59,101 --> 04:21:00,101
How is it?

1914
04:21:00,220 --> 04:21:02,300
It's good.

1915
04:21:04,605 --> 04:21:12,420
It's good.

1916
04:21:12,840 --> 04:21:13,840
Let's eat together.

1917
04:21:14,040 --> 04:21:15,040
It's so good.

1918
04:21:18,740 --> 04:21:20,380
It's so good.

1919
04:21:21,000 --> 04:21:22,800
I want to eat this.

1920
04:21:26,080 --> 04:21:28,680
I want to eat this.

1921
04:21:28,960 --> 04:21:29,960
I want to eat this.

1922
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:35,420
It's so good.

1923
04:21:43,740 --> 04:21:44,860
Nani, do you want to do it?

1924
04:21:45,600 --> 04:21:46,600
Do you want to do it?

1925
04:21:46,840 --> 04:21:48,060
Do you want to do it?

1926
04:21:49,120 --> 04:21:50,120
Do you want to do it?

1927
04:21:50,360 --> 04:21:52,600
Come here.

1928
04:22:00,820 --> 04:22:03,160
You're so cute.

1929
04:22:13,740 --> 04:22:15,920
You can do it now, can't you?

1930
04:22:20,140 --> 04:22:21,880
So cute!

1931
04:22:35,240 --> 04:22:37,760
Whose mouth is it?

1932
04:22:38,200 --> 04:22:40,860
It's everyone's mouth.

1933
04:22:45,040 --> 04:22:47,020
Let's take care of each other.

1934
04:22:49,720 --> 04:22:52,540
It's like an elevator.

1935
04:22:54,560 --> 04:22:55,880
It's like a Kintama elevator.

1936
04:22:56,920 --> 04:22:58,080
It's going up and down.

1937
04:22:59,020 --> 04:23:00,020
Which one do you like?

1938
04:23:10,920 --> 04:23:13,560
Which one do you like?

1939
04:23:13,561 --> 04:23:14,561
I'm so happy!

1940
04:23:15,190 --> 04:23:16,190
I'm so happy!

1941
04:23:17,840 --> 04:23:19,560
I'm so happy!

1942
04:23:21,720 --> 04:23:23,520
I'm so happy!

1943
04:23:23,720 --> 04:23:24,920
I'm so happy!

1944
04:23:36,260 --> 04:23:39,020
It's so good!

1945
04:23:43,560 --> 04:23:45,440
You're so cute!

1946
04:23:47,660 --> 04:23:48,300
You're so cute!

1947
04:23:48,301 --> 04:23:49,301
Don't lick me.

1948
04:23:52,080 --> 04:23:53,400
You're so nice.

1949
04:23:54,740 --> 04:23:55,740
I'll hold you.

1950
04:24:03,840 --> 04:24:06,340
You're so nice.

1951
04:24:07,740 --> 04:24:08,920
I'll hold you tight.

1952
04:24:09,960 --> 04:24:14,220
You're so nice.

1953
04:24:17,040 --> 04:24:18,300
It's so good.

1954
04:24:19,840 --> 04:24:20,080
It's so good.

1955
04:24:20,760 --> 04:24:21,820
I'll have the joint.

1956
04:24:22,480 --> 04:24:23,480
Thank you.

1957
04:24:24,220 --> 04:24:25,220
It looks so good.

1958
04:24:28,820 --> 04:24:30,020
Let's try the flavor.

1959
04:24:31,290 --> 04:24:32,500
Which one do you like?

1960
04:24:32,660 --> 04:24:33,720
Which one do you like?

1961
04:24:33,880 --> 04:24:35,320
I'll try this one.

1962
04:24:37,640 --> 04:24:38,980
Is it good?

1963
04:24:39,360 --> 04:24:40,360
How is it?

1964
04:24:43,560 --> 04:24:44,780
It's so good.

1965
04:24:44,781 --> 04:24:45,340
What does it taste like?

1966
04:24:45,341 --> 04:24:46,341
What does it taste like?

1967
04:24:55,960 --> 04:24:57,240
It's amazing!

1968
04:24:58,940 --> 04:24:59,940
It's coming out!

1969
04:25:01,780 --> 04:25:02,780
It's coming out!

1970
04:25:04,320 --> 04:25:05,720
I want that one too!

1971
04:25:05,721 --> 04:25:06,880
I'm shaking.

1972
04:25:09,160 --> 04:25:13,860
What does it taste like?

1973
04:25:15,660 --> 04:25:18,720
It's like...

1974
04:25:21,120 --> 04:25:22,120
Expensive.

1975
04:25:23,400 --> 04:25:27,400
It's expensive.

1976
04:25:29,080 --> 04:25:33,500
I'll have the expensive one.

1977
04:25:35,920 --> 04:25:36,920
Wow!

1978
04:25:37,080 --> 04:25:38,080
Is it English-ranked?

1979
04:25:39,100 --> 04:25:41,260
Is it okay because there
are a lot of younger sisters?

1980
04:25:46,600 --> 04:25:48,940
No, you can't eat this.

1981
04:25:52,040 --> 04:25:53,960
Look, it's an English-ranked team.

1982
04:25:54,520 --> 04:25:55,520
English-ranked?

1983
04:25:55,580 --> 04:25:56,580
English-ranked?

1984
04:25:58,740 --> 04:26:00,460
Is it delicious?

1985
04:26:00,640 --> 04:26:01,640
It's delicious.

1986
04:26:02,020 --> 04:26:03,080
It's too expensive.

1987
04:26:06,710 --> 04:26:08,200
Oh, it's so good!

1988
04:26:13,080 --> 04:26:14,580
Can I have an English lamp?

1989
04:26:16,160 --> 04:26:17,500
I want you to light it up.

1990
04:26:18,880 --> 04:26:20,400
Do you want me to light it up for you?

1991
04:26:25,390 --> 04:26:26,390
No, I'm scared.

1992
04:26:29,760 --> 04:26:31,080
I don't have one.

1993
04:26:31,081 --> 04:26:32,081
I don't think so.

1994
04:26:34,820 --> 04:26:35,820
What's wrong?

1995
04:26:36,000 --> 04:26:37,000
He's frowning.

1996
04:26:37,240 --> 04:26:38,240
Really.

1997
04:26:39,390 --> 04:26:40,390
He's frowning.

1998
04:26:45,740 --> 04:26:47,380
Wow, he's shaking.

1999
04:26:47,700 --> 04:26:48,700
His tail is shaking.

2000
04:26:48,980 --> 04:26:49,980
Let's do it together.

2001
04:26:50,940 --> 04:26:51,940
From there.

2002
04:26:54,680 --> 04:26:57,540
It looks fun.

2003
04:27:01,620 --> 04:27:02,620
Wow!

2004
04:27:04,100 --> 04:27:05,620
The high-class Chimp is delicious!

2005
04:27:07,080 --> 04:27:09,180
The Egoranke was delicious!

2006
04:27:09,800 --> 04:27:11,280
The Egoranke was delicious!

2007
04:27:11,620 --> 04:27:11,680
I want to eat it!

2008
04:27:11,681 --> 04:27:12,440
I want to eat it!

2009
04:27:12,441 --> 04:27:13,441
I want to eat it!

2010
04:27:15,060 --> 04:27:18,280
I want to eat it!

2011
04:27:19,700 --> 04:27:20,700
Really?

2012
04:27:22,975 --> 04:27:23,975
Wow!

2013
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:25,880
It's a million yen!

2014
04:27:25,881 --> 04:27:26,881
I'm so full.

2015
04:27:27,400 --> 04:27:28,920
Wait, how about this?

2016
04:27:29,880 --> 04:27:31,200
You are so big.

2017
04:27:37,360 --> 04:27:42,660
The biggest one in the world.

2018
04:27:46,320 --> 04:27:47,320
It's so tasty.

2019
04:27:47,380 --> 04:27:49,260
It's so good.

2020
04:27:55,880 --> 04:27:59,300
I'll give you some more!

2021
04:28:09,105 --> 04:28:12,940
This is the taste of wild!

2022
04:28:15,805 --> 04:28:17,600
How does it taste?

2023
04:28:21,080 --> 04:28:22,020
You are a good boy.

2024
04:28:22,021 --> 04:28:22,160
Wow!

2025
04:28:22,740 --> 04:28:24,320
You are eating well.

2026
04:28:34,580 --> 04:28:36,420
You are eating until your fingers are gone.

2027
04:28:37,680 --> 04:28:38,680
Wow!

2028
04:28:38,920 --> 04:28:40,640
You are eating until your fingers are gone.

2029
04:28:43,390 --> 04:28:44,390
Wow!

2030
04:28:47,600 --> 04:28:48,600
Come closer.

2031
04:28:51,720 --> 04:28:52,880
Smile.

2032
04:28:55,200 --> 04:28:56,500
Great.

2033
04:28:56,900 --> 04:29:05,440
I'm so happy.

2034
04:29:05,900 --> 04:29:09,440
I'm going to go blank.

2035
04:29:09,980 --> 04:29:10,980
I'm going to go blank.

2036
04:29:11,620 --> 04:29:13,480
What should I do?

2037
04:29:13,481 --> 04:29:14,481
Is it going to come out?

2038
04:29:15,520 --> 04:29:16,560
Let's see if it comes out.

2039
04:29:16,660 --> 04:29:17,660
I want to see it!

2040
04:29:22,320 --> 04:29:23,320
It's sad.

2041
04:29:25,360 --> 04:29:28,100
It's sad.

2042
04:29:28,101 --> 04:29:31,960
It's sad.

2043
04:29:32,060 --> 04:29:37,340
It's sad.

2044
04:29:43,421 --> 04:29:45,280
Come here.

2045
04:29:45,920 --> 04:29:48,220
Yoroshiku.

2046
04:29:49,460 --> 04:29:50,620
You are great.

2047
04:29:54,510 --> 04:29:55,510
Yoroshiku.

2048
04:29:57,140 --> 04:29:58,140
Come here.

2049
04:30:00,470 --> 04:30:02,020
You are like an angel.

2050
04:30:03,040 --> 04:30:04,660
Yoroshiku.

2051
04:30:05,680 --> 04:30:05,960
You are great.

2052
04:30:06,520 --> 04:30:07,520
Come here.

2053
04:30:18,160 --> 04:30:19,860
It's amazing!

2054
04:30:20,280 --> 04:30:20,900
What is it?

2055
04:30:21,080 --> 04:30:21,400
What is it?

2056
04:30:21,900 --> 04:30:23,060
It hurts!

2057
04:30:25,900 --> 04:30:27,340
It's delicious!

2058
04:30:30,060 --> 04:30:31,240
It's delicious!

2059
04:30:31,241 --> 04:30:31,260
It's dangerous.

2060
04:30:31,640 --> 04:30:32,640
It tastes like wild.

2061
04:30:32,720 --> 04:30:34,540
It's dangerous.

2062
04:30:35,140 --> 04:30:36,220
It's dangerous.

2063
04:30:36,221 --> 04:30:37,880
It's coming out.

2064
04:30:40,200 --> 04:30:41,160
It's coming out.

2065
04:30:41,161 --> 04:30:45,400
It's coming out.

2066
04:30:49,685 --> 04:30:51,000
I'm so happy.

2067
04:30:51,400 --> 04:30:54,280
I'm so happy.

2068
04:30:55,820 --> 04:30:56,940
It's moving.

2069
04:30:59,060 --> 04:31:00,180
I'm so happy.

2070
04:31:01,900 --> 04:31:02,900
It's moving.

2071
04:31:03,100 --> 04:31:04,100
It's moving a lot.

2072
04:31:06,120 --> 04:31:07,700
I don't think it's digital.

2073
04:31:08,240 --> 04:31:09,720
I'm so happy.

2074
04:31:11,180 --> 04:31:12,180
I'm so happy.

2075
04:31:12,320 --> 04:31:16,320
I'm so happy.

2076
04:31:22,180 --> 04:31:24,480
Let's go with you.

2077
04:31:24,481 --> 04:31:25,776
Enough! Let's go to our room next door.

2078
04:31:25,800 --> 04:31:29,240
The little ones go to bed.

2079
04:31:31,180 --> 04:31:33,260
Shall we go?

2080
04:31:33,500 --> 04:31:34,500
Let's go to my room.

2081
04:31:36,440 --> 04:31:37,440
We're going!

2082
04:31:48,120 --> 04:31:49,120
I can't sleep.

2083
04:31:49,360 --> 04:31:50,360
I can't sleep anymore.

2084
04:31:50,560 --> 04:31:51,880
I'm afraid she'll come again.

2085
04:31:54,240 --> 04:31:55,320
I can't sleep anymore.

2086
04:32:01,700 --> 04:32:02,900
Thank you for the meal.

2087
04:32:03,460 --> 04:32:04,460
Thank you for the meal.

2088
04:32:10,900 --> 04:32:12,900
I've been drinking a lot.

2089
04:32:13,940 --> 04:32:14,940
I've been drinking a lot.

2090
04:32:15,320 --> 04:32:16,440
I've been drinking a lot.

2091
04:32:17,520 --> 04:32:20,060
It was amazing today.

2092
04:32:21,880 --> 04:32:23,400
There were a lot of people.

2093
04:32:23,740 --> 04:32:31,820
There were a lot of people, and everyone
was so erotic that I was quite satisfied.

2094
04:32:33,000 --> 04:32:34,000
Are you satisfied?

2095
04:32:34,180 --> 04:32:36,060
Is it your first time?

2096
04:32:37,370 --> 04:32:40,460
It's the largest number of
people I've ever been to.

2097
04:32:40,640 --> 04:32:41,660
That's right.

2098
04:32:43,000 --> 04:32:45,760
There were a lot of people on the bus.

2099
04:32:46,160 --> 04:32:49,600
A lot of faces came out and changed a lot.

2100
04:32:50,250 --> 04:32:54,203
Aya-San has a lot of things
to do, and Gou-kun has

2101
04:32:54,215 --> 04:32:58,260
a lot of things to do, but
I don't know what to do.

2102
04:32:59,370 --> 04:33:00,690
I still have a lot of adrenaline.

2103
04:33:02,220 --> 04:33:04,600
But it's not enough yet.

2104
04:33:06,460 --> 04:33:08,200
I said it wasn't enough.

2105
04:33:10,840 --> 04:33:16,500
But I still have tomorrow,
so I'm looking forward to it.

2106
04:33:18,580 --> 04:33:20,840
But I'm glad today.

2107
04:33:22,800 --> 04:33:24,040
It reminds me of something.

2108
04:33:25,450 --> 04:33:26,560
Reminds you of what?

2109
04:33:27,500 --> 04:33:28,500
Reminds you of something.

2110
04:33:29,280 --> 04:33:30,260
Reminds you of something.

2111
04:33:30,300 --> 04:33:31,300
I'm getting excited.

2112
04:33:32,205 --> 04:33:33,760
Don't you have any?

2113
04:33:35,560 --> 04:33:36,560
Reminds me of something.

2114
04:33:37,080 --> 04:33:40,160
There was such a wonderful actress.

2115
04:33:41,000 --> 04:33:42,060
I could understand the feelings of a man.

2116
04:33:42,061 --> 04:33:42,400
I understand.

2117
04:33:43,080 --> 04:33:44,540
It's like an eye massage.

2118
04:33:44,960 --> 04:33:45,960
I know.

2119
04:33:46,020 --> 04:33:47,020
Everyone is naked.

2120
04:33:47,420 --> 04:33:48,480
I want to feel good.

2121
04:33:49,260 --> 04:33:50,600
In front of us.

2122
04:33:51,660 --> 04:33:53,520
I want to make everyone a side dish.

2123
04:33:54,920 --> 04:33:56,440
I understand the feelings of the fans.

2124
04:33:57,925 --> 04:34:00,380
I want to see it as a side dish.

2125
04:34:01,120 --> 04:34:01,220
That's right.

2126
04:34:01,940 --> 04:34:02,940
I want to touch it.

2127
04:34:03,260 --> 04:34:03,660
It's amazing.

2128
04:34:04,080 --> 04:34:05,120
I want to touch it.

2129
04:34:05,900 --> 04:34:10,700
If I touch it now...
It's hot, isn't it?

2130
04:34:10,701 --> 04:34:11,701
Oh, wait a minute.

2131
04:34:12,100 --> 04:34:13,100
It's really hot.

2132
04:34:13,860 --> 04:34:14,860
It's a souvenir.

2133
04:34:16,540 --> 04:34:18,060
This is hot with alcohol.

2134
04:34:19,280 --> 04:34:20,500
I'm already hot.

2135
04:34:20,920 --> 04:34:22,020
I'm quite satisfied today.

2136
04:34:23,020 --> 04:34:24,020
By the way,

2137
04:34:25,310 --> 04:34:26,700
What is it?

2138
04:34:27,040 --> 04:34:28,040
Something.

2139
04:34:29,070 --> 04:34:30,680
The story changes a lot.

2140
04:34:32,430 --> 04:34:33,430
Do you do it yourself?

2141
04:34:34,020 --> 04:34:35,020
quite.

2142
04:34:37,010 --> 04:34:38,080
I do.

2143
04:34:38,560 --> 04:34:39,560
I do.

2144
04:34:39,680 --> 04:34:41,280
I want to hear about that.

2145
04:34:43,340 --> 04:34:45,380
How often do you do it?

2146
04:34:46,560 --> 04:34:47,660
How often do you do it?

2147
04:34:47,810 --> 04:34:49,210
I want to know how often you do it.

2148
04:34:49,740 --> 04:34:50,520
I want to know how often you do it.

2149
04:34:50,521 --> 04:34:51,820
I'm interested in that too.

2150
04:34:52,490 --> 04:34:54,980
I do it once a week.

2151
04:34:55,180 --> 04:34:56,380
I do it once a week.

2152
04:34:56,945 --> 04:34:57,960
I do it once a week.

2153
04:34:58,500 --> 04:34:59,020
That's so mean.

2154
04:34:59,480 --> 04:35:03,760
I do it once a week.

2155
04:35:03,761 --> 04:35:04,840
I'll finish it at once.

2156
04:35:06,015 --> 04:35:07,015
It's a little hot.

2157
04:35:08,040 --> 04:35:09,560
My tongue is tingling.

2158
04:35:10,920 --> 04:35:13,000
Is there such a word
as an important meeting?

2159
04:35:15,480 --> 04:35:16,200
No, there isn't.

2160
04:35:16,350 --> 04:35:17,460
What is important?

2161
04:35:17,880 --> 04:35:22,880
If I think about it, I'll take a little.

2162
04:35:24,340 --> 04:35:26,060
What are you going to do?

2163
04:35:27,160 --> 04:35:28,620
I think it's good to have a girl's skin.

2164
04:35:28,621 --> 04:35:30,661
I thought it would be
nice if I could do that, too.

2165
04:35:32,465 --> 04:35:34,620
I want to see beautiful things.

2166
04:35:38,050 --> 04:35:39,050
That's great.

2167
04:35:40,440 --> 04:35:42,400
I've seen the works of the
same actress, Madonna.

2168
04:35:47,460 --> 04:35:49,060
I've bought a lot of Don Pichon's works.

2169
04:35:53,520 --> 04:35:56,020
Do you use them as side dishes?

2170
04:35:56,740 --> 04:35:57,740
Yes, I do.

2171
04:35:57,960 --> 04:36:00,280
I do that a lot.

2172
04:36:03,250 --> 04:36:04,290
When do you want to do it?

2173
04:36:06,240 --> 04:36:07,240
On a rainy day.

2174
04:36:07,640 --> 04:36:11,000
When it's raining at night.

2175
04:36:12,100 --> 04:36:14,220
The sound of rain is so good.

2176
04:36:15,570 --> 04:36:16,760
It makes me feel sexy.

2177
04:36:17,740 --> 04:36:18,780
It's like a sensual novel.

2178
04:36:20,380 --> 04:36:21,200
With your ears.

2179
04:36:21,201 --> 04:36:21,280
With your ears?

2180
04:36:21,660 --> 04:36:23,040
Yes, with my ears.

2181
04:36:23,560 --> 04:36:26,200
But it's kind of moist.

2182
04:36:27,200 --> 04:36:28,580
I can hear the sound of water.

2183
04:36:30,030 --> 04:36:31,030
But when I look sideways,

2184
04:36:31,180 --> 04:36:32,180
there's no one there.

2185
04:36:32,420 --> 04:36:33,420
I'm like, should I do it?

2186
04:36:33,900 --> 04:36:35,500
It's a little higher.

2187
04:36:36,390 --> 04:36:39,240
It's the sex I used to do in the past.

2188
04:36:39,980 --> 04:36:40,980
It's a great thing.

2189
04:36:41,460 --> 04:36:42,460
Play it in my brain.

2190
04:36:43,780 --> 04:36:45,080
I'm going to do it.

2191
04:36:45,740 --> 04:36:46,760
There's a lot.

2192
04:36:47,830 --> 04:36:49,460
That's why I love it in the rainy season.

2193
04:36:49,461 --> 04:36:50,461
I like it too.

2194
04:36:50,980 --> 04:36:51,980
You do it every day.

2195
04:36:53,340 --> 04:36:54,620
That's great.

2196
04:36:55,280 --> 04:36:56,280
That's amazing.

2197
04:36:56,440 --> 04:36:59,840
I'm a little embarrassed.

2198
04:37:01,320 --> 04:37:02,320
I can't say it.

2199
04:37:03,080 --> 04:37:04,280
I can't say it.

2200
04:37:04,840 --> 04:37:08,400
If you say it, I'll do it.

2201
04:37:09,360 --> 04:37:12,020
I'll do it.

2202
04:37:12,021 --> 04:37:12,620
I'll do it.

2203
04:37:12,621 --> 04:37:13,980
I'll do it.

2204
04:37:13,981 --> 04:37:14,880
That's cool.

2205
04:37:14,881 --> 04:37:15,881
It's so cool.

2206
04:37:17,720 --> 04:37:19,880
That's how it is.

2207
04:37:20,560 --> 04:37:20,620
I see.

2208
04:37:21,460 --> 04:37:22,460
It's so different.

2209
04:37:22,830 --> 04:37:24,200
It's so different.

2210
04:37:24,440 --> 04:37:25,440
It's so opposite.

2211
04:37:27,700 --> 04:37:29,540
On my day off,

2212
04:37:30,510 --> 04:37:31,540
I eat first.

2213
04:37:33,200 --> 04:37:34,600
I eat first.

2214
04:37:34,880 --> 04:37:35,880
I eat snacks first.

2215
04:37:36,870 --> 04:37:37,880
I eat snacks first.

2216
04:37:38,140 --> 04:37:39,340
I eat late-night snacks first.

2217
04:37:39,540 --> 04:37:41,640
So I don't want to eat first.

2218
04:37:42,490 --> 04:37:43,490
I don't think so.

2219
04:37:44,460 --> 04:37:46,300
I think it's because you
have three big needs.

2220
04:37:46,880 --> 04:37:51,680
You want to eat well, and
you want to sleep well after that.

2221
04:37:53,415 --> 04:37:56,800
I don't think so.

2222
04:37:58,190 --> 04:37:59,600
I don't think so.

2223
04:37:59,650 --> 04:38:01,100
I don't think so.

2224
04:38:04,680 --> 04:38:06,500
I don't think so.

2225
04:38:07,230 --> 04:38:10,960
I don't think so.

2226
04:38:10,961 --> 04:38:11,280
I don't think so.

2227
04:38:11,281 --> 04:38:11,300
I don't think so.

2228
04:38:11,301 --> 04:38:11,360
I don't think so.

2229
04:38:11,361 --> 04:38:11,380
I don't think so.

2230
04:38:11,381 --> 04:38:13,540
I'm a little embarrassed.

2231
04:38:14,700 --> 04:38:15,920
I'm not wearing white today.

2232
04:38:19,160 --> 04:38:21,260
Do you all take a bath?

2233
04:38:22,580 --> 04:38:23,580
I do.

2234
04:38:24,980 --> 04:38:25,980
I don't!

2235
04:38:27,040 --> 04:38:28,040
Do you wear a yukata?

2236
04:38:28,700 --> 04:38:29,700
I do.

2237
04:38:31,050 --> 04:38:32,760
Do you wear a yukata and underwear?

2238
04:38:33,730 --> 04:38:36,520
I don't, but... Do you
wear it to save yourself?

2239
04:38:36,521 --> 04:38:37,521
I put it on just in case.

2240
04:38:38,320 --> 04:38:40,200
Let's just put it on for now.

2241
04:38:40,940 --> 04:38:42,160
Is that so? What should I do?

2242
04:38:42,780 --> 04:38:44,120
Let's take a peek.

2243
04:38:44,980 --> 04:38:45,980
Is it real?

2244
04:38:46,040 --> 04:38:47,040
It's no bra.

2245
04:38:54,270 --> 04:38:55,200
Oh no.

2246
04:38:55,201 --> 04:38:56,480
Can I stand up?

2247
04:38:57,020 --> 04:38:59,180
Stand up a little.

2248
04:39:01,230 --> 04:39:02,230
I'm so excited.

2249
04:39:02,770 --> 04:39:03,880
I can't do it.

2250
04:39:03,881 --> 04:39:04,881
What?

2251
04:39:05,740 --> 04:39:07,220
I saw it.

2252
04:39:07,240 --> 04:39:08,520
I saw it.

2253
04:39:09,000 --> 04:39:10,160
This is terrible.

2254
04:39:11,000 --> 04:39:14,480
This is... I won't die.

2255
04:39:14,720 --> 04:39:16,001
It was hard to put on underwear.

2256
04:39:16,330 --> 04:39:18,120
You don't put on underwear, do you?

2257
04:39:18,760 --> 04:39:21,240
It looks like an armor.

2258
04:39:22,400 --> 04:39:23,400
I see.

2259
04:39:23,480 --> 04:39:25,500
I'm the only one who didn't come in.

2260
04:39:26,440 --> 04:39:27,600
The most erotic.

2261
04:39:28,040 --> 04:39:29,040
I'm so excited.

2262
04:39:30,000 --> 04:39:30,360
Terrible.

2263
04:39:30,361 --> 04:39:31,420
Oh, it's in.

2264
04:39:33,260 --> 04:39:34,820
It's in.

2265
04:39:35,380 --> 04:39:36,380
It's in.

2266
04:39:37,980 --> 04:39:38,980
It's white, right?

2267
04:39:40,260 --> 04:39:41,420
Wait, wait, wait.

2268
04:39:41,421 --> 04:39:46,000
I was just... I
was just talking.

2269
04:39:46,580 --> 04:39:47,580
What?

2270
04:39:47,940 --> 04:39:48,940
What?

2271
04:39:50,300 --> 04:39:52,641
This finger... This
is the only one.

2272
04:39:53,360 --> 04:39:54,640
This is the only one.

2273
04:39:57,010 --> 04:39:58,400
I'm still saying it.

2274
04:39:58,401 --> 04:39:59,721
I still have a lot of work to do.

2275
04:40:01,350 --> 04:40:03,200
Can I say something weird?

2276
04:40:04,300 --> 04:40:06,560
Can I do something weird now?

2277
04:40:07,480 --> 04:40:07,960
Of course.

2278
04:40:08,200 --> 04:40:09,000
Can I?

2279
04:40:09,100 --> 04:40:10,100
I want to see you.

2280
04:40:10,400 --> 04:40:13,460
I don't think I can sleep.

2281
04:40:15,870 --> 04:40:17,200
Can I do something weird now?

2282
04:40:17,920 --> 04:40:18,920
I want to see you.

2283
04:40:19,080 --> 04:40:21,940
I'm hot.

2284
04:40:23,240 --> 04:40:24,520
I want to see you.

2285
04:40:26,430 --> 04:40:28,280
It's hard to take it off.

2286
04:40:30,830 --> 04:40:32,260
Please take it off.

2287
04:40:33,100 --> 04:40:34,940
It's taken off.

2288
04:40:41,120 --> 04:40:43,440
It's painful.

2289
04:40:49,980 --> 04:40:52,820
It's really hot.

2290
04:40:53,170 --> 04:40:56,540
Oh no, it's been washed away.

2291
04:40:57,490 --> 04:40:58,490
Oh no, oh no.

2292
04:40:59,000 --> 04:41:02,260
I'm surrounded by such a beautiful woman.

2293
04:41:07,760 --> 04:41:08,880
Look at this.

2294
04:41:09,060 --> 04:41:10,060
This is really bad.

2295
04:41:10,730 --> 04:41:12,140
Oh no.

2296
04:41:15,390 --> 04:41:16,926
If you take the top part,
you have to wash it away.

2297
04:41:16,950 --> 04:41:18,520
Eh? No way.

2298
04:41:18,940 --> 04:41:19,500
Wait a minute.

2299
04:41:19,940 --> 04:41:22,960
Why am I being attacked like this?

2300
04:41:23,140 --> 04:41:24,140
Is this a prank?

2301
04:41:24,540 --> 04:41:25,540
Is this a prank?

2302
04:41:25,780 --> 04:41:27,080
Wait a minute.

2303
04:41:27,480 --> 04:41:28,480
Wait a minute.

2304
04:41:30,580 --> 04:41:31,580
Amazing.

2305
04:41:31,660 --> 04:41:32,660
What is this?

2306
04:41:33,850 --> 04:41:35,780
I'm so happy, but I'm a little embarrassed.

2307
04:41:37,360 --> 04:41:38,360
No!

2308
04:41:39,280 --> 04:41:39,740
Eh?

2309
04:41:40,020 --> 04:41:41,080
Wait a minute.

2310
04:41:41,710 --> 04:41:43,180
Am I the only one who is strange?

2311
04:41:43,181 --> 04:41:44,261
Don't you think it's weird?

2312
04:41:45,290 --> 04:41:47,280
I think it's going to go in soon.

2313
04:41:50,480 --> 04:41:54,660
Don't you think it's weird?

2314
04:41:56,240 --> 04:41:57,540
Take it off!

2315
04:41:58,480 --> 04:41:59,480
Take it off!

2316
04:42:00,980 --> 04:42:01,980
Panties!

2317
04:42:03,180 --> 04:42:04,180
Give me panties!

2318
04:42:06,980 --> 04:42:08,120
Give me panties!

2319
04:42:08,540 --> 04:42:09,820
Please take off your underpants.

2320
04:42:10,310 --> 04:42:11,676
If you don't mind, let's
take off your underpants.

2321
04:42:11,700 --> 04:42:13,420
I don't want to take them off.

2322
04:42:13,440 --> 04:42:15,500
Let's take them off and go outside.

2323
04:42:16,420 --> 04:42:19,580
If we are wearing the same
clothes, I will be relieved.

2324
04:42:20,690 --> 04:42:25,860
I don't want to wear them.

2325
04:42:28,160 --> 04:42:28,680
That's right.

2326
04:42:28,681 --> 04:42:29,780
Let's change the clothes.

2327
04:42:30,720 --> 04:42:31,480
Change the clothes?

2328
04:42:31,481 --> 04:42:33,860
It's hard to see.

2329
04:42:34,020 --> 04:42:37,200
It was amazing just now,
so I can't see it slowly.

2330
04:42:37,960 --> 04:42:38,960
I can't see it at all.

2331
04:42:39,780 --> 04:42:40,780
It's a big deal.

2332
04:42:42,140 --> 04:42:42,800
What did I do?

2333
04:42:43,130 --> 04:42:44,880
It's the best position, isn't it?

2334
04:42:45,080 --> 04:42:46,880
Wait a minute.

2335
04:42:52,180 --> 04:42:54,760
I can't do it anymore.

2336
04:42:56,340 --> 04:42:57,820
Do you prefer the middle or the neck?

2337
04:42:58,660 --> 04:42:59,700
Both feel good.

2338
04:43:00,900 --> 04:43:02,010
I can't take it anymore.

2339
04:43:10,620 --> 04:43:11,940
I can feel your passion.

2340
04:43:13,000 --> 04:43:14,000
I know.

2341
04:43:14,160 --> 04:43:17,100
I don't care about anything.

2342
04:43:18,060 --> 04:43:20,140
It feels good.

2343
04:43:22,410 --> 04:43:24,260
It's short.

2344
04:43:26,960 --> 04:43:27,960
Only four of us.

2345
04:43:30,930 --> 04:43:32,820
You were the quietest.

2346
04:43:33,360 --> 04:43:34,360
I was.

2347
04:43:35,090 --> 04:43:37,900
It's true, but there are so
many things to worry about.

2348
04:43:38,980 --> 04:43:40,780
We don't have enough time.

2349
04:43:42,060 --> 04:43:45,820
It's weird to say, let's sleep as it is.

2350
04:43:47,340 --> 04:43:48,880
It was amazing.

2351
04:43:52,480 --> 04:43:57,180
We're doing something great, aren't we?

2352
04:43:57,181 --> 04:43:58,181
You're amazing.

2353
04:43:59,170 --> 04:44:00,580
You're drinking alcohol.

2354
04:44:01,400 --> 04:44:02,920
I want to borrow the power of alcohol.

2355
04:44:08,980 --> 04:44:10,340
I want to concentrate on this too.

2356
04:44:14,740 --> 04:44:21,080
Let's get everyone to
look at the hot place.

2357
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:37,320
I want to have sex again.

2358
04:44:48,760 --> 04:44:50,980
I want sex again.

2359
04:44:52,950 --> 04:44:54,380
I want to have sex.

2360
04:45:05,580 --> 04:45:06,440
I'm so happy.

2361
04:45:06,441 --> 04:45:07,761
It feels really good, doesn't it?

2362
04:45:08,040 --> 04:45:09,320
It's the best.

2363
04:45:10,880 --> 04:45:12,220
It's very luxurious.

2364
04:45:13,740 --> 04:45:14,740
I'm so happy.

2365
04:45:16,920 --> 04:45:18,140
It feels so good.

2366
04:45:21,180 --> 04:45:22,500
I'm going to sleep.

2367
04:45:42,730 --> 04:45:43,900
I'm sorry.

2368
04:45:54,260 --> 04:45:55,840
I'm going to die.

2369
04:45:58,150 --> 04:45:59,180
I'm going to die.

2370
04:46:01,060 --> 04:46:02,060
I'm going to die.

2371
04:46:02,900 --> 04:46:06,260
I'm going to die.

2372
04:46:16,820 --> 04:46:18,020
Ai-kun!

2373
04:46:34,280 --> 04:46:35,440
Ai-kun!

2374
04:46:42,600 --> 04:46:43,600
Ai-kun!

2375
04:46:44,480 --> 04:46:45,640
Ah!

2376
04:46:48,280 --> 04:46:49,280
Ah!

2377
04:46:52,070 --> 04:46:53,230
Ah!

2378
04:46:53,430 --> 04:46:54,430
Ah!

2379
04:46:56,180 --> 04:46:57,390
Wow, amazing!

2380
04:46:57,850 --> 04:46:58,850
Wow, amazing!

2381
04:46:59,870 --> 04:47:00,930
Ah!

2382
04:47:04,160 --> 04:47:06,170
This is a good girl.

2383
04:47:06,710 --> 04:47:07,710
Ah!

2384
04:47:09,800 --> 04:47:10,800
Ah!

2385
04:47:11,030 --> 04:47:12,190
Ah!

2386
04:47:12,711 --> 04:47:14,170
I can't stop crying.

2387
04:47:14,171 --> 04:47:15,630
I can't stop crying.

2388
04:47:18,200 --> 04:47:19,480
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
