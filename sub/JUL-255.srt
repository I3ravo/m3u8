1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to eat it.

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to do it.

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can do it.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You sit down.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to do it.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sit down and eat.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can do it.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sit down and rest.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be right back.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's wrong?

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't want to.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's wrong?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I broke the camera you were holding.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're kidding.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry. What should I do?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's okay.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's okay.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't worry. It's going to be all right.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But...

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Get some rest. It's going to be all right.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry. I was taking good care of him.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's going to be all right.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, he's here.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,180
I'm going to the

28
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
shop.

29
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,180
Senpai!

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
I'm Kobusata.

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,180
Senpai came, so I'll go down a little.

33
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,180
I'm going to the

34
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,180
shop.

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm going to the

36
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
shop.

37
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Are you okay?

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm fine.

39
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,180
Senpai is here, so I'll go downstairs.

40
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
Okay.

41
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,180
Senpai, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
Thank you for coming.

43
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,180
Thank you very much.

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,180
But your company is closing down.

45
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
Isn't that obvious to the public?

46
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm in charge of the local government, so I can't help it.

47
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
It's been two years?

48
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,180
No, it's been three years.

49
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,180
It's been since I married Marina.

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,180
I can't believe it.

51
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,180
You're still the same.

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm still a moving company.

53
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,480
That's why you're as stiff as you used to be.

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
You're still the same.

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,680
You've gotten thinner, haven't you?

56
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,180
That's right.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,180
My wife often says that I used to do rugby.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
So you've become an elite man?

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,180
No, not yet.

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,380
I'll help you.

61
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,220
Are you all right?

62
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,380
What should I do?

63
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,980
No, it's all right.

64
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,740
I can't do it.

65
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
That's...

66
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Don't be so hasty.

67
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,740
I'm Marina-san.

68
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,740
Huh?

69
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
That coach's daughter?

70
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
Yes.

71
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,740
I haven't greeted my parents yet, but...

72
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
How should I put it...

73
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,740
I wanted to get advice from Osawa-senpai.

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Advice?

75
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
That's Onikouchi.

76
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
He's still stubborn and stubborn.

77
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
He's an old man.

78
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Well, that's true, but...

79
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
If you have to,

80
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,740
get your daughter married to him.

81
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Yes.

82
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Anyway, congratulations.

83
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,740
I think she'll be a good wife.

84
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Thank you.

85
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Cheers!

86
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Congratulations!

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Thank you.

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,740
You did well.

89
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
Thank you.

90
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Congratulations on your wedding.

91
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,740
And good job on your move.

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Cheers!

93
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,740
You helped me move two times.

94
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
That's right.

95
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
At first, Takashi...

96
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
It's okay, Ozawa-senpai.

97
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
She knows about it.

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Oh, I see.

99
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,740
At first, you helped Takahashi when he got married, didn't you?

100
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
That's right.

101
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,740
It's the same for Ozawa-senpai, but he also supported me mentally.

102
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
I heard from my father.

103
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,740
He said that the team would be well organized because he was good at taking care of others.

104
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Did that Oniguson say that?

105
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,740
He didn't say a word to me.

106
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,440
I told you. It's still in my memory.

107
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,140
What? You wanted me to do it, didn't you?

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,840
Then I could have won.

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,340
Is that why you couldn't win?

110
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,640
But I really had a hard time with that divorce.

111
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,140
Thank you very much.

112
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,640
Are you going to cry again?

113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,640
I'm going to cry.

114
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Isn't it good to cry?

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,640
That's the time.

116
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Will you marry Takashi, who got divorced and was depressed?

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Do it at the Rakubi Obikai.

118
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,640
After that, get drunk and sneak into Kochi's house.

119
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Are you going to sleep with this child?

120
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
Idiot!

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,740
I'm sorry. I came to get you out of prison.

122
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,340
I came to get you out of prison.

123
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,340
Anyway,

124
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,140
you shouldn't have touched a single finger

125
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,640
even when you were pregnant.

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
It's not just Kochi.

127
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,240
Think of us as enemies of all OBs.

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,240
If you're not happy, you'll be hated.

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Yes, I'll make you happy.

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Let's have another toast!

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Cheers!

132
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Let's eat sushi.

133
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
That's right.

134
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Let's eat.

135
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Let's eat.

136
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I'll start with the mackerel.

137
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Itadakimasu.

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
It's really good.

139
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm glad you liked it.

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
It's good.

141
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
That face.

142
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
It looks really good.

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
It's really good.

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
It's really good.

145
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
It's really good.

146
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
It's really good.

147
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
It's really good.

148
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
He's already gone.

150
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
You're right.

151
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Did he really do rugby?

152
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
You can't see it, can you?

153
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
He did.

154
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
But he was often kicked out.

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I knew it.

156
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I don't think I can rely on you.

157
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
You fell in love with a man you can't rely on, right?

158
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Well...

159
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,240
You can't rely on him, but what did you like about him?

160
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
He's kind.

161
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,240
But I wonder if it's really good to be kind to him.

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I don't get it.

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Isn't it good to be a kind man?

164
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I wonder.

165
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I don't know what to say.

166
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Okay, let's play a game.

167
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Game?

168
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Yes.

169
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Rock-paper-scissors.

170
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
What's that?

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Rock-paper-scissors.

172
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
If you lose,

173
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,240
you have to tell me something that no one can say.

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm going to talk to you.

175
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Sounds interesting.

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I'm curious about your embarrassing experience.

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay, then let's play rock-paper-scissors.

178
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Okay.

179
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
One, two, three, four.

180
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Rock-paper-scissors.

181
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Go ahead.

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
That's right.

183
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Oh, about last weekend.

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
What?

185
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,740
I wanted to go to the bathroom, but I couldn't find it, so I got it from my dad.

186
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,740
No way. Where did you get it?

187
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:34,740
I ran home and got it from the company, but I couldn't find it, so I put it in my bag.

188
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,740
I just got it from my dad.

189
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,740
No way. Where did you get the key?

190
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,740
It was in my pocket.

191
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,740
I can't help it.

192
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
It's true.

193
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
I'll do it again.

194
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Again?

195
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Again.

196
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
First, I'll do it.

197
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
I lost.

198
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Well, I'm going to ask him to come.

199
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,740
He's going to tell me something embarrassing that I've never heard of.

200
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Oh, is there such a secret?

201
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Oh, there it is.

202
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,740
What, what, what? Tell me.

203
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,740
I was talking about the fun.

204
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,740
That's right. That's right. I got it.

205
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

206
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Actually, I had a dream.

207
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
What kind of dream?

208
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Well, that's...

209
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,740
That muscular, macho rugby player...

210
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
...pushed me down...

211
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
...and that's what happened.

212
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,740
What is it?

213
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
You know what it is, don't you?

214
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
No, no, no, no, no.

215
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
You have to tell me clearly.

216
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
What is it?

217
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
So, everything.

218
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
What?

219
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Did you kiss me?

220
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
So, everything.

221
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Was it a scary dream?

222
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Or was it a good dream?

223
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
It's a secret.

224
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Tell me. You want to know, don't you?

225
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Then I'll tell you when I win the next one.

226
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Oh, sure.

227
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Let's see...

228
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Let's see...

229
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Let's have a talk.

230
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Okay.

231
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
It was a good dream.

232
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Don't tell him.

233
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,740
You had a dream, didn't you?

234
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,740
And did you see her with such a dirty eye?

235
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
No, I didn't.

236
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,740
That's why you had such a dream.

237
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Come on, let me think about it.

238
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Do you like strong men?

239
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
What?

240
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Wait, that's not it.

241
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
You can't?

242
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,740
No, I don't want to do that.

243
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
I see.

244
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm a little drunk.

245
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
You're drunk.

247
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm sorry I said something weird.

248
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
I'm going home now.

249
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Take care of her.

250
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Okay.

251
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
That's enough.

252
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Bye.

253
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Thank you very much.

254
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
See you tomorrow.

255
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
Bye.

256
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Should I bring the fridge?

257
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Let's do it.

258
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Okay.

259
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,740
Let's do it.

260
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Okay.

261
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Let's do it.

262
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Let's do it.

263
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Hold on.

264
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Let's go.

265
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
It's okay.

266
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,740
You can sleep over there.

267
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Okay, let's go.

268
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
Can I carry all of these?

269
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Yes, please.

270
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
Okay.

271
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
It's so light.

272
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm going to the toilet.

273
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,540
Are you okay?

274
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm fine.

275
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,640
This is too heavy.

276
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Be careful

277
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Amazing

278
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
What is this?

279
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
What is this?

280
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Please put it in

281
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
It's really heavy

282
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm tired.

283
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I have to work hard.

284
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm tired.

285
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
What are you doing?

286
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm fine.

287
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Do you want to ride the train?

288
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
I can't ride it.

289
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
I don't want to take the double train.

290
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
I see.

291
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Can you get on the train and show me the way?

292
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Thank you.

293
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
That would be better.

294
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
I'll take the double train with her.

295
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Maria,

296
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
I'll take the double train.

297
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
It's comfortable.

298
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
It's my first time taking the double train.

299
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,640
It's my first time, so I'm excited.

300
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm sorry. I'll be in your care.

301
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Okay, let's go.

302
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,640
All right, let's go.

303
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
It looks like there's going to be a lot of traffic.

304
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
That's right.

305
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,640
But I don't think it's going to work if we use high-speed cars.

306
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
All right.

307
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Then you're the passenger.

308
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes.

309
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
You can sit in the passenger seat

310
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay

311
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Let's go to the left

312
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Amazing

313
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
You can touch a lot

314
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Hold this

315
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Are you okay?

316
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Thank you

317
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Let's ask the driver

318
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Sit down

319
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Thank you

320
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Let's go

321
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Are you okay?

322
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
I'm okay

323
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I'll drive safe

324
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Please

325
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Don't tell your wife

326
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
I'm okay

327
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Let's go

328
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
I'm counting on you

329
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Thank you

330
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
I'll drive safely so please fasten your seat belt

331
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Thank you

332
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm looking forward to working with you, Umi-chan.

333
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,640
I heard that your husband was also involved in sports with Ozawa-san.

334
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Oh, that's right.

335
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
It's a long time ago.

336
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Everyone, be careful.

337
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
I'll turn on the lights.

338
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Are you going to turn on the lights?

339
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
That's great.

340
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,640
I'm going to clean up here.

341
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Sit down.

342
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Thank you very much.

343
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
This is great.

344
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Thank you.

345
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
It's comfortable, isn't it?

346
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Yes, it's not bad.

347
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
It's like a limousine, isn't it?

348
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Have you ever ridden a limousine?

349
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
No.

350
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
It's my limousine, isn't it?

351
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
That's true.

352
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
I'm so happy.

353
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Thank you so much for taking care of Mr. Ozawa.

354
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Don't mention it.

355
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
It's been a while since we last met.

356
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
It must have been a hassle moving out of the blue.

357
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
It's not like that.

358
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I was happy to meet a beautiful woman.

359
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
I don't need that kind of situation.

360
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
By the way, does Ozawa-san have a family?

361
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Yes, he does.

362
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Huh? He does? He's from the past?

363
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Yes, he's from the past.

364
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,640
When my younger daughter graduated from college,

365
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,640
she got divorced from her husband.

366
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
When?

367
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,140
Five years ago, I had a ten-year divorce.

368
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
I see.

369
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,140
I've been married for a long time,

370
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,140
so I've always been at the forefront of the times.

371
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,140
Stop it.

372
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
How was it? Was it fun?

373
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,140
You're always making fun of me, aren't you?

374
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Hahaha.

375
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Life is hard work, isn't it?

376
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,140
I don't care if it's a lie, I just have to live brightly.

377
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Isn't that better?

378
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,140
You are so cool.

379
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,140
I just read the lines of the novel.

380
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Hahaha.

381
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,140
But that may be so.

382
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,140
Living brightly and fun even if it's a lie.

383
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
That's what I've been doing.

384
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
How long has it been since you moved?

385
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Well, compared to Mr. Osawa, it may be a little less than a year.

386
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,140
She treats me like a princess, but...

387
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,140
What? You don't like being nice?

388
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,140
But if I say I don't like this, I wonder how greedy I am.

389
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,140
I'm the worst.

390
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
I'm sorry.

391
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Osawa-san?

392
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,140
You can hit me if you want.

393
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,140
I'll do anything for you.

394
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,140
Don't say that.

395
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,140
I won't let you go like I did back then.

396
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,140
Until I make you mine.

397
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
No.

400
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
No.

401
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
No!

402
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Oh!

403
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Oh!

404
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
Oh, no!

405
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Oh!

406
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Oh, I'm sorry. I wonder if it's okay.

407
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
I have to get out of here and climb the ladder.

408
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,140
I have to do it.

409
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,140
But I can't do it.

410
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,140
I have to get out of here.

411
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,140
I have to climb this ladder.

412
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,140
I can't do it.

413
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,140
I can't do it.

414
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I can't do it.

415
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,140
I can't do it.

416
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Oh, it's hot!

417
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Don't get cold!

418
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Oh, it's hot!

419
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Don't get cold!

420
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
Don't get cold!

421
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
Oh, my God.

422
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Oh, my God.

423
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
Oh, my God.

424
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Oh, my God.

425
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
It's okay, it's okay.

426
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:25,000
It owner is using diagonal

427
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,340
It goes straight for a while

428
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,160
Okay I got it

429
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,380
There's something you want to do

430
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,680
I'll do it

431
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,780
I'll smash everything

432
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,780
2

433
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,780
3

434
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
4

435
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,780
5

436
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,780
6

437
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
7

438
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
8

439
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
9

440
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,780
10

441
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
11

442
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
12

443
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
13

444
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,780
14

445
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
15

446
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
I can't breathe.

447
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,780
It's amazing.

448
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,780
It's amazing.

449
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
I'm sorry.

450
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,780
I'm sorry.

451
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
I'm sorry.

452
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Let's go.

453
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,660
It was incredible!

454
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,660
Let's go, let's go.

455
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,660
Do you feel better?

456
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,660
Yes, I do.

457
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

458
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
I'm sorry.

459
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,660
I'm sorry.

460
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,660
I'm sorry.

461
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,660
I'm sorry.

462
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
I'm sorry.

463
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,660
Don't do this to me.

464
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,660
Don't do this to me.

465
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,660
Don't do this to me.

466
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,660
I'm tired. I'm tired.

467
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Saira...

468
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,660
Saira...

469
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,660
Saira...

470
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,620
I'm so stupid.

471
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,620
No!

472
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,620
Ryo...

473
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,620
I'm scared.

474
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,620
I'm scared.

475
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,620
Let's go.

476
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
Be careful.

477
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,620
It's hot.

478
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,620
Oh, it's hot.

479
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,620
Let's get out of here.

480
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,620
Let's get out of here.

481
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,620
Let's get out of here.

482
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,620
I'm sorry.

483
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,620
You did something terrible.

484
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,620
It's really terrible.

485
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,620
It's not going to work.

486
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,620
It's terrible.

487
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,620
It's cold.

488
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,620
It will be ready soon.

489
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,620
Oh, really?

490
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,620
Then there is a supermarket and a school nearby.

491
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
That's good.

492
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,620
I'm sorry.

493
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,620
Are you all right, Osan-san?

494
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,620
I'm fine.

495
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,620
Please open the door.

496
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,620
Okay.

497
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,620
Please wait.

498
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,620
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

499
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,620
I'm sorry.

500
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,620
Did you have a good time?

501
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
Not at all.

502
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,620
It was fun.

503
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Really?

504
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,620
What would you like to drink?

505
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,620
Yes, please.

506
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,620
Thank you.

507
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,620
Thank you.

508
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Thank you.

509
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,620
What do you want to dance?

510
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,620
Are you okay?

511
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,620
Yes, it was fun.

512
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,620
Really?

513
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,620
You shook.

514
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,620
Yes, I shook.

515
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,620
Like this?

516
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,620
More.

517
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,620
Are you okay?

518
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,620
Let's go to the car.

519
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,620
Wait.

520
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,620
Oh!

521
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,620
Here.

522
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,620
Is it heavy?

523
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,620
Are you okay?

524
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,620
It's okay.

525
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,620
Be careful.

526
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,620
It's dangerous.

527
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,620
Are you okay?

528
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,620
I'm fine.

529
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,620
Are you okay?

530
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,620
Are you okay?

531
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,620
I'm fine.

532
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,620
I'm so tired.

533
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,620
This is amazing.

534
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,620
What's wrong?

535
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,620
I'm going to buy a broom.

536
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,620
You're going to buy a broom?

537
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,860
By the way, I'm going to buy something to drink

538
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,860
Oh, I see

539
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,860
In that case, Ike-chan

540
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,860
I'm going to buy something

541
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,860
Let's go together

542
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,860
Okay

543
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,860
I'll do it here

544
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,860
I'm sorry

545
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,860
I'm going to go

546
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,860
I'm already satisfied, so I won't do it anymore.

547
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,860
I'm not satisfied.

548
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,860
Are you satisfied?

549
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
I'm not satisfied.

550
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,860
Are you satisfied?

551
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,860
I didn't.

552
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:24,860
You're not satisfied, are you?

553
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,860
Did you do it?

554
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,860
I don't know.

555
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,860
But I'll come back

556
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,860
It's okay.

557
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,860
I want to talk to you.

558
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,860
No, I don't want to talk to you.

559
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,860
Then talk to me.

560
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,860
No.

561
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,860
I'm tired.

562
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
I'm so tired.

563
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,860
I'm sorry.

564
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,860
I'll be back soon.

565
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,860
It's hard and delicious, isn't it?

566
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:33,860
But I'll be back.

567
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:36,860
It's okay.

568
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,860
It's good, isn't it?

569
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:07,860
I'm sorry.

570
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,860
Hurry up.

571
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,860
Close the lid.

572
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:15,860
Don't.

573
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,360
I'm so tired.

574
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,940
Don't leave me alone.

575
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,940
Got it?

576
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,280
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

577
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,320
You're so mean.

578
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,660
Why are you laughing?

579
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,860
Because it's weird.

580
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,660
Why? What's so weird about it?

581
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,720
I'm sorry.

582
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,220
I'm so glad you're here.

583
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,320
This is a nice place.

584
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,520
Yeah, it is.

585
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,520
It's close to a convenience store.

586
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,820
It used to be far from here.

587
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,420
It was inconvenient.

588
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,420
The supermarket was far from here, too.

589
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,220
Oh, right.

590
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,620
I'll go get some cardboard.

591
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,820
Thank you.

592
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,820
That's right.

593
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,220
It's not good for the bowl.

594
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,220
That's right.

595
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,820
It's hard to eat

596
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,320
Thank you.

597
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,320
But it's okay.

598
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,820
Thank you.

599
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,820
Let's go.

600
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,820
Let's go.

601
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,820
Thank you.

602
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,820
Thank you.

603
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:33,820
Thank you.

604
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,820
Thank you.

605
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,820
Thank you very much.

606
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,820
Are you okay?

607
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,820
I'm fine.

608
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,820
Thank you very much.

609
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,820
You too.

610
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,820
Thank you very much.

611
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,820
Let's go.

612
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,820
Hey, what's wrong?

613
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,820
Nothing.

614
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,820
At least we made it in time to sleep.

615
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,820
I'll open the cardboard box from tomorrow.

616
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,820
I'm sorry. I'll leave it to you.

617
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,820
But don't push yourself too hard.

618
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,820
I'll be fine.

619
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,820
Anyway, Ozawa-san...

620
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,820
What?

621
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:03,820
You're still so energetic.

622
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,820
You're all glistening, aren't you?

623
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,320
Yes, I am.

624
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
I'm all glistening.

625
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,320
I see.

626
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,820
I'm sorry.

627
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,320
I'm a little tired today.

628
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,320
Oh, I see.

629
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,320
I'm sorry.

630
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,320
Why are you apologizing?

631
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,320
I'm sorry.

632
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,320
Are you okay?

633
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
I can't do it because I'm not okay.

634
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,320
Good night.

635
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,320
Good night.

636
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

637
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

638
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

639
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:57,320
When my younger daughter entered college, she broke up with her father-in-law.

640
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,320
Are you happy?

641
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,320
Yes.

642
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,320
Well...

643
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,320
Well, I wonder if it's the answer to the mid-term question.

644
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,320
Is there a problem with such a good guy?

645
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,320
I see.

646
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,320
I'm sorry.

647
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,320
Come on, come on.

648
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:54,320
I'll do anything for you, so hit me now.

649
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,320
Don't say that.

650
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,320
I won't let you go like I did back then.

651
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:21,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

652
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,320
Oh, no!

653
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,320
Oh, no!

654
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,320
Do what you want to do.

655
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,320
I'll make it happen.

656
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,320
Let's go.

657
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,320
My sister is in the hospital.

658
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
I'm thinking about the things she needs to do.

659
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,320
She's taking the medicine.

660
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
Don't worry.

661
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
I'll be here with you.

662
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,320
She's okay.

663
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
I'll be there with you too.

664
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
I'll be there with you.

665
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
I'll be there with you.

666
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,320
I'll be there with you.

667
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,320
I'll be there with you.

668
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,320
I'll be there with you.

669
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
I'll be there with you.

670
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:31,480
After making a hole in the dough, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.

671
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:39,520
After 30 minutes, remove the plastic wrap and let it rest for another 30 minutes.

672
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:46,960
After 30 minutes, remove the plastic wrap and let it rest for another 30 minutes.

673
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,960
I'm sorry.

674
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,960
Is he working?

675
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
Yes.

676
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,960
Is he working alone?

677
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,360
Did you get the hang of it?

678
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,560
Not yet.

679
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,560
Then I'll help you.

680
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,400
Not at all.

681
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,900
You're right.

682
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,020
You like dogs, don't you?

683
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:58,700
If he finds out, it's all your fault.

684
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,700
It's all my fault.

685
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:36,700
Ah!

686
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,700
I'll take care of this Sunday.

687
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,700
I'm sorry I haven't made any progress.

688
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:05,700
It's none of your business. I'll take care of it. I'm sorry.

689
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,700
Why are you apologizing?

690
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,700
What?

691
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,700
It's your job, but you don't know the meaning of apologizing.

692
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:20,700
Thank you for the meal.

693
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,700
I'll go now.

694
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,700
See you.

695
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,700
See you.

696
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,700
I'm going to sleep now.

697
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,700
I'll just sleep a little more.

698
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,700
Okay.

699
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,700
I'll get back to work.

700
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,700
Okay.

701
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,700
I'll be back.

702
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,700
Okay.

703
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,700
I'll be back.

704
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,700
Okay.

705
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,700
I'll be back.

706
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,700
Okay.

707
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,700
I'll be back.

708
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,700
Okay.

709
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,700
I'll be back.

710
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,700
Happy birthday!

711
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,460
Happy birthday!

712
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:11,660
Happy birthday!

713
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:14,100
I don't know. I guess it's like this.

714
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:15,180
Happy birthday!

715
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:16,700
Happy birthday!

716
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,620
Happy birthday!

717
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,620
Congratulations!

718
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,620
Congratulations!

719
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,620
Congratulations!

720
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,620
Who is it?

721
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:14,620
You didn't clean up at all, did you?

722
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,620
I don't think I did.

723
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:21,620
Why not?

724
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:28,620
I thought Mr. Ozawa wouldn't come if I cleaned up the cardboard.

725
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:34,620
When you're done with the cardboard, then you'll thinkpresents won't hang around anymore.

726
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:35,620
It's so good!

727
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,620
It's so good!

728
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,620
Are you okay?

729
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,620
What should I do?

730
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:54,620
I'm sorry.

731
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,620
I'm sorry.

732
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,620
I'm sorry.

733
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,620
Sarah.

734
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,620
I'm so happy.

735
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:52,620
I love you so much.

736
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,620
Come on, move.

737
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,620
Take it easy.

738
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:16,620
We have sex, don't we?

739
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,620
It hurts.

740
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,620
I'm crying.

741
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:43,620
It's still in my mouth.

742
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:45,620
It's okay.

743
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:47,620
It's my blood.

744
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:50,620
It's still in my mouth.

745
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,620
It's still in my mouth.

746
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,220
Go!

747
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,280
You didn't move.

748
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:48,300
This is scary.

749
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,340
This feels awful.

750
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:57,300
Marisa's

751
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:04,300
I love you the most when you're tired.

752
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,300
You're amazing.

753
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:12,300
You're so strong.

754
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,300
I'm strong.

755
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,300
We're really the perfect size.

756
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,300
I'm sorry.

757
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,300
I want to do it every day.

758
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:49,300
I want to go to the hospital every day.

759
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,300
Oh, it's great.

760
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,300
It's perfect.

761
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,300
It's great.

762
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:43,300
Does it feel good?

763
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:45,300
It's the best.

764
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:50,300
I don't do it because I don't want you to feel bad.

765
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,300
I told you.

766
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:04,300
I'm sorry if I told you.

767
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:37,300
Can I go now?

768
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:39,300
Yes, you can go.

769
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,300
I'm going.

770
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,300
I'm going.

771
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,300
Amazing.

772
01:44:51,300 --> 01:45:04,300
I'm glad you're okay.

773
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:06,300
I'm sorry.

774
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,300
I'm sorry.

775
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:44,300
Let's go.

776
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,300
Wow!

777
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,300
I want to drink too.

778
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,300
Me too.

779
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:02,300
I want to drink too.

780
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,300
Okay.

781
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:13,300
I'll drink too.

782
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:47,300
I'm not a bad person.

783
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,300
I love you.

784
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:54,300
She is crying because she is afraid of water.

785
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,300
She is crying because she is afraid of water.

786
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:02,300
She is crying because she is afraid of water.

787
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:10,300
I am worried about water.

788
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:42,940
Then okikiri

789
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:43,680
Then okikiri

790
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,680
Then okikiri

791
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:49,180
Fine, you can skip that, right

792
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:49,960
Fine, you can skip that, right

793
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:55,080
Then okikiri

794
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,340
Then okikiri

795
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,560
Oh

796
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:10,180
Cheese

797
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:13,180
Oh, it's hot.

798
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:14,180
It's fine.

799
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:16,180
I'm not a fan.

800
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:18,180
It's good.

801
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:20,180
I'm not a fan.

802
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:22,180
If you eat too much, you'll get sick.

803
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:24,180
I'm not a fan.

804
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:26,180
I'm not a fan.

805
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:29,180
Why do you keep eating?

806
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:31,180
I'm not a fan.

807
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,180
I'm not a fan.

808
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:35,180
Why do you keep eating?

809
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:37,180
I'm not a fan.

810
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,180
I'm not a fan.

811
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,180
It's so hot.

812
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,180
That's great.

813
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:46,180
It's perfect.

814
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:49,180
It's perfect.

815
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:54,180
I'm so happy.

816
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:05,180
You look so cool.

817
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,180
Don't cry.

818
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:14,180
Don't cry.

819
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:17,180
I'm sleepy.

820
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:19,180
Oh, it's hot!

821
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:23,180
Oh, it's hot!

822
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:37,180
It's hot!

823
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:08,180
I'm sorry.

824
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:21,180
No!

825
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:25,180
I'm sorry.

826
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,180
I'm sorry.

827
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:02,180
I'm so tired.

828
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,180
I feel so good.

829
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:18,180
Oh, I feel so good.

830
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:21,180
I feel so good.

831
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:22,180
What's going on?

832
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,180
I feel sick.

833
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:28,840
Pero no te heparé.

834
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:31,040
Pero no te.

Pero no te pero拿手。

01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,060
I'm sorry.

839
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:10,060
I can't forgive you.

840
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:15,060
I don't know if I'm responsible for this.

841
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:18,060
I can't blame you.

842
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:22,060
You're so kind.

843
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:27,060
But I don't need this kind of kindness anymore.

844
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:35,060
Ozawa-san.

845
01:54:35,060 --> 01:54:41,060
Mr. Ozawa, take me away from him.

846
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:07,060
Thank you for watching!
