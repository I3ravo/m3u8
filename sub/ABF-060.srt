1
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,220
Humming

2
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:42,930
This is a small rural world.

3
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,850
How many more summers
will I spend in my life?

4
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,790
At the end of summer, there is
something I always remember.

5
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,870
Hey, Take-chan?

6
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,830
Megumi-san, you're finally back.

7
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,230
I have a favor to ask you.

8
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,790
What's wrong?

9
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
No, it's nothing.

10
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,270
Come here.

11
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

12
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,870
I'm begging you. It's a lifetime request.

13
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,450
Come here.

14
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,390
But I'm really busy.

15
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,710
Come on.

16
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
Sit down, sit down.

17
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,710
Mr. Yoshimura, I brought him as promised.

18
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,690
Oh, you came.

19
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,291
I thought you would run away again.

20
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,030
You are a bastard, aren't you?

21
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,990
You really have a strong bad luck.

22
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,961
Hey, Ake-chan, please explain the movie.

23
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,670
Miss,

24
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,530
Didn't you hear anything from this bastard?

25
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
What do you mean?

26
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,050
To put it simply, you were sold.

27
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,990
What?

28
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,330
I'll explain it to you.

29
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,110
Meguri, I'm really sorry.

30
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,350
I don't have any money left.

31
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:10,684
I was told that Kumicho-san
doesn't have anything valuable,

32
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:15,950
so I immediately told him
about Meguri, and this happened.

33
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,630
I'm really sorry.

34
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,890
Hey, you bastard, are you
protecting yourself again?

35
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,590
Miss, do you want me to tell
you what he said? Kumicho-san.

36
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,691
Shut up!

37
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,951
There is a woman who can say anything.

38
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
She is very cute.

39
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,341
She said she will definitely become rich.

40
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,930
This bastard.

41
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,550
What?

42
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,970
Mr. Meguri, please help me.

43
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,570
Please.

44
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,690
Mr. Meguri, help me.

45
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,510
You don't like it, do you?

46
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,830
Hey, you bastard!

47
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,220
You know what to do if you
can't pay me back, don't you?

48
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,441
Sign the life insurance, you bastard!

49
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,660
Yuri-san, please help me!

50
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
What are you doing?

51
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,500
Why are you screaming in front of a woman?

52
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,950
Sign it or not!

53
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,940
Help me, Yuri-san! I'm going.

54
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,710
Meguri-san.

55
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,710


56
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,710
I don't want you to die.

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Are you sure?

58
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
But I want you to promise me something.

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
Will you love me forever?

60
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,451
Don't you want to be with me forever?

61
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,961
Are you going to sacrifice
yourself for the man you love?

62
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,051
It's a waste to be such a bastard!

63
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,490
Come on, let's go.

64
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,310
Come on, this way.

65
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,450
Come on, this way.

66
00:06:43,380 --> 00:07:00,130
It's from now on.

67
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,620
Have you ever
used it? It's a toy.

68
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400


69
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,090
Do you feel your neck?

70
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,930
How do you feel?

71
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,110
If you feel good, say it.

72
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,210
Come on.

73
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,630
Be honest.

74
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,660
Open your mouth.

75
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,110
Open your mouth.

76
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
More.

77
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,900
This side, too.

78
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,880
Open your mouth.

79
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,760
Don't close your mouth.

80
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,340
Hey!

81
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,160
Don't be scared.

82
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
Do like this.

83
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
Here?

84
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,610
What?

85
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,510
Do you feel good?

86
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,070
Do you feel good?

87
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,550
I can't hear you.

88
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,570
I feel good.

89
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Please do more.

90
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,990
Please help me.

91
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,690
Like this?

92
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,920
Don't be afraid.

93
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:47,120
Stand up.

94
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
You are amazing.

95
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,020
You have a big butt.

96
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,021
Don't do that.

97
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,400
If you don't listen to me, I'll hurt you.

98
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Hiwa! Come here.

99
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
You look great.

100
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560


101
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,030
What would that idiot
think if he saw you like this?

102
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,450
No.

103
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,850
Come here.

104
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,100
Don't go without permission.

105
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,101
Don't be afraid.

106
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm sure you'll say,

107
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Can I go with you? OK? Come on.

108
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Hang in there.

109
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,870


110
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:03,540


111
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
It's not over yet.

112
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
Come on.

113
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,430
OK.

114
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,970
That's it.

115
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,150
Open your arms wider.

116
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,760
Like this.

117
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,620
You are a good boy.

118
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,020
How do you feel when you
are seen by your boyfriend?

119
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,790
Please look at the dog.

120
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,660
I can't hear you. Speak louder.

121
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,920
Look at the dog.

122
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,980
Please lick the dog.

123
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,610
Open your mouth.

124
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,490
Open your mouth.

125
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,790
Open your mouth.

126
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,450
You have a beautiful face.

127
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,510
You have a beautiful face.

128
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,511
How do you like it?

129
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,790
How do you like it?

130
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,631
My stupid boyfriend
doesn't lick me like this.

131
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:58,370
I'm going to eat it.

132
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,390
How do you feel? I can't eat it.

133
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,290
Come on.

134
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,750


135
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,890
Don't be a fool. Come here.

136
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,830
You're sweating a lot. Swallow it.

137
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,450
Let me swallow your sweat.

138
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,150
Let me swallow your sweat.

139
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,270
Please let me do it.

140
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,030
Yes, do it.

141
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:54,250
Don't lick your nipples.

142
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,030
Don't lick them.

143
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,810
Don't lick them more.

144
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,050
Huh? Don't lick me.

145
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,590


146
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
OK.

147
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Look.

148
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm getting hard.

149
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,740
I said, let me serve you.

150
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
Let me serve you.

151
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Not yet.

152
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,710
Can you do it properly?

153
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
How is it? I can't do it.

154
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,930


155
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,070
Put your hands up.

156
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,890
OK?

157
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,270
Open your mouth.

158
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,150
Open your mouth and feel it.

159
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,270
How do you like it compared to
your stupid boyfriend, Chimpo?

160
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,470
Which one is better?

161
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
If you don't understand,
I'll make you understand.

162
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:23,180
Hey, what are you
doing? Come on, do it.

163
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,160


164
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,250
Do you like it?

165
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,070
Hey! Go to the back.

166
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Oh, I see.

167
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,910


168
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,590
You are sweating. Drink the medicine.

169
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,380
Do you like it?

170
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
I can't hear you.

171
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:22,560
It's delicious.

172
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,700
Please let me lick you more.

173
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,260
Please let me lick you more.

174
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Stand up.

175
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,640
Stand up.

176
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,330
Stand up.

177
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,310
Stand up.

178
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:40,311
Yes.

179
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,130
Open your hands.

180
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,210
Put it in the sink.

181
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:07,810
Are you going to put it in the sink?

182
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,050
You want it, right?

183
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,150
Put it on the sofa.

184
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,290
Open it again.

185
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,970
Open it again and
say, Put it in the sink.

186
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,790
You always say that.

187
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,230
Hey! Come on, relax.

188
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Don't whine.

189
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,140


190
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Do you want more?

191
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:48,190
Do you want more?

192
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,330
You want me to give you a big one?

193
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Please get well soon.

194
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,220
Please lie down here.

195
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,720
Lie down here.

196
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,900
Please lie down here.

197
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,390
Today, I'm going to show you a video
of a baby who is eating a baby food.

198
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,270
I'm going to show you a video of
a baby who is eating a baby food.

199
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,126
I'm going to show you a video of
a baby who is eating a baby food.

200
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,286
I'm going to show you a video of
a baby who is eating a baby food.

201
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:43,850
I'm going to show you a video of
a baby who is eating a baby food.

202
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,030
Hey, hey.

203
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,610
It's very tight.

204
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,270
Look.

205
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,730
Not yet.

206
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:56,750
Come on.

207
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,930
Just a little more.

208
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,650
It's a pacifier for your pussy.

209
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,060
Put your hand out.

210
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,700
I said, put your hand out from behind.

211
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,250
Put your foot out more.

212
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:12,020
I said, put your hand out from behind.

213
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:14,280
Please put it in from behind.

214
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:33,680
Do you feel better than
your stupid boyfriend?

215
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,260
Do it by yourself.

216
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,100
Look at here.

217
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,060
Yes, it's hurt.

218
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:23,320
Yes, yes, yes.

219
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:24,641
Yes, yes, yes. Do it by yourself.

220
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,510
You are a pervert.

221
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,270
I feel sick.

222
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,670
I feel sick.

223
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:44,671
I'm sorry.

224
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,510
Do you want to put it in?

225
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
You can put it all in.

226
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,120
You can put it in.

227
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,180
You can put it in.

228
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,300
I can't.

229
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,640
I can't.

230
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:17,880
You can't.

231
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,080
Be careful.

232
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm sorry.

233
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
Today, you are mine.

234
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
OK? Here you are.

235
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,980


236
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,790
No! Please take it.

237
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Oh, it's hot.

238
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,420


239
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,560
It's hot, isn't it?
Here you are.

240
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760


241
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,460
Wow, it's great.

242
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:37,701
Please feel good with my mango.

243
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,180
Please feel good with my mango.

244
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:43,420
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

245
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:51,520
You're making a sad face.

246
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,630
I'm sorry.

248
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,150
Who told you to take it off?

249
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,870
Come on, get on my lap.

250
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,530
Put your hands up.

251
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,030
Do you feel good? Look at me.

252
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,230


253
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:19,610
Do you want to be my girl?

254
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,630
Do you? Come on.

255
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:22,631


256
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:52,580
It's been a long time since
I've had a baby, so I'm a little

257
00:30:52,592 --> 00:31:04,490
nervous, but I'm going to do
my best to take care of my baby.

258
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,397
I'm going to do my best
to take care of my baby,

259
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:14,110
so I'm going to do my best
to take care of my baby.

260
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:15,111
Are you okay? It hurts.

261
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:16,930


262
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,190
It's not over yet.

263
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,290
It hurts.

264
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,070
Do you want me to take you to a nice place?

265
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,910
No.

266
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,046
What? You don't want me
to take you to a nice place?

267
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,070
No.

268
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,420
Hey, don't make yourself feel bad.

269
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,290
It hurts.

270
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,291
I'm sorry.

271
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,650
You're bleeding.

272
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,610
Hey, open your eyes again.

273
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,990
I told you to be quiet.

274
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,680
I'm sorry.

275
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:54,000
Mom, I feel sick.

276
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,070
Here?

277
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Come on, open your mouth.

278
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,840
Say something.

279
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,500
Mom, please say something.

280
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,520
Say something.

281
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,040
Mom, please don't make me feel sick.

282
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,040
Don't leave me alone.

283
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,200
Don't be sad.

284
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,420
Let's go.

285
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,880
Come here.

286
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,780
Lie down.

287
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:00,781
Take a deep breath.

288
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,480
Open your mouth.

289
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:59,340
Take-san, don't worry about it.

290
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,670
You'll be fine.

291
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,620
In this countryside,

292
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,620
I can't do anything but buy pachinko.

293
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,480
But I'll be fine in a little while.

294
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Oh, yeah.

295
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,080
What's this? It's a present.

296
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140


297
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,620
I made it myself.

298
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:30,930
It's beautiful,
isn't it? Thank you.

299
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,410


300
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,470
I don't have money, so I've
never given you a present.

301
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,570
How is it? Do you like it? Yeah.

302
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:42,710
Thank you.

303
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,410


304
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,710
Wow, that's wonderful.

305
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,590
But I won't give you any money from now on.

306
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,630
Let's kiss.

307
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,350
You're going to try to
fool me again, aren't you?

308
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,620
Then let's do it as usual.

309
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,060
Please, please.

310
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,680
Here? Please, please.

311
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
I don't care.

312
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:05,940
Just for today.

313
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,420


314
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,200
Really? Thank you.

315
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,100
Let's go.

316
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,101
Hurry up.

317
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,310


318
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,350
You are not afraid of anything.

319
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,920
You are wearing underwear.

320
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:04,190
You are so stiff.

321
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,970
I can't stand it.

322
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,990
Hurry up.

323
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,810
あ。

324
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,510
う。

325
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,290
あ。

326
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,570
キムチ。

327
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,930
う。

328
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,670
う。

329
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,030
う。

330
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,191
う。 う。

331
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,166
Today, I'm going to show you how to
make the most delicious ramen in the world.

332
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,070
I'm going to show you how to make
the most delicious ramen in the world.

333
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:16,240
I'm going to show you how to make
the most delicious ramen in the world.

334
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:25,370
I'm going to show you how to make
the most delicious ramen in the world.

335
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:36,170
【The sound of a baby eating】

336
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:57,850
【The sound of a baby coughing】 【The
sound of a baby blowing a nose】 It's hot.

337
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,090
It's hot.

338
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,590


339
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,470
Is it hot?

340
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:07,950
Yes.

341
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,310
It's not good temperature.

342
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,490
Stand here.

343
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,570
Take off your shirt.

344
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,650
Take off?

345
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I'm embarrassed.

346
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,850
Are you okay?

347
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,630
Nobody is watching you.

348
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,710
Nobody is watching.

349
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,240
【Taking a bath】

350
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,940
You like it, don't you?

351
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,321
Give me a little more... More?

352
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,680
Is it good?

353
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah! Ouch! Oh, no.

354
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480


355
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,680
..

356
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Oh, no?

357
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
You should not go.

358
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,460
It's hot.

359
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,220
It's so good.

360
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:17,660
Oh, no? Oh, no.

361
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
It feels good.

362
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,080
Does it feel good?

363
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,540
Yes.

364
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Oh, no.

365
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,620
Ouch! No, no, no.

366
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,940
No, no, no.

367
00:42:26,941 --> 00:42:28,661
Hold on, Kuromu.

368
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,840
Do your best, Leo.

369
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Today, I'm going to show
you a video of me eating.

370
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,250
I'm going to sleep.

371
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:08,350
I'm going to wake up.

372
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,070
Don't do that.

373
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:24,310
I thought it would be important.

374
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,380
Hey, don't you want to
talk to me? I'm working.

375
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,580


376
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,200
You haven't called me recently.

377
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,260
I'm sorry.

378
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,271
I want you to call me a little.

379
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
I said I'm sorry.

380
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,720
I don't know what's going
on with our relationship.

381
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,370
I don't know.

382
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:07,870
What do you want to say?

383
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,370
Our relationship as lovers is broken.

384
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,140
Hey, can you do that later?
I'm looking for a job now.

385
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Don't run away. Let's talk.

386
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,840
I don't know about Megwin, but I
want to concentrate on my current job.

387
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,580
I know, but we have to think together.

388
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,100
Hey, I'm going to the bathroom.

389
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:55,000
Hey, wait a minute. Let's talk.

390
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:56,001
How is it?

391
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,620
Well, I'll tell you.

392
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,062
You don't know how I
feel when I work in the

393
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:15,920
countryside and spend
my time comfortably.

394
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,091
You want to break up because
you don't know, don't you?

395
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,920
But you don't tell me, so I don't know.

396
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,961
I'm thinking about the future.

397
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,800
Have you ever thought about money?

398
00:49:35,035 --> 00:49:37,836
You can't imagine what the future
will be like in a country like this.

399
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,540
You can say such a terrible thing.
I'm thinking about it, too.

400
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:49,380
Have you ever wanted to leave such
a small country and learn the world?

401
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,810
Is it so difficult to work in Tokyo?

402
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,050
It's not like that.

403
00:49:58,051 --> 00:49:59,051
It's not like that.

404
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:04,730
They might be chit-chatting here, but when
they go out, they don't communicate at all.

405
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,900
Is there no house in Satoshi's future?

406
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,440
I can't think of that now.

407
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,760
Do you like me?

408
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:27,820
It's not like that.

409
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:33,280
I just wanted to be with you, Satoshi.

410
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,120
That's enough.

411
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,260
Hey.

412
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,420
I'm sorry about earlier.

413
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,100
What's the matter? You know.

414
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,140
..

415
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Let's break up.

416
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,020
It's the limit, isn't it?

417
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,780
I don't know if I can do that.

418
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:08,781
I don't know.

419
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,270
I can't be happy.

420
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,210
Don't you change your mind?

421
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,320
I'm sorry for everything.

422
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,800
Why do you love me so
much, but it's so painful?

423
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,920
Don't apologize to me.

424
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,720
I just feel empty.

425
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:04,290
Thank you for loving me.

426
00:57:40,310 --> 00:59:17,750
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

427
01:00:17,950 --> 01:01:38,810
This is a video of a
baby eating a baby's food.

428
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:39,811
The baby is crying.

429
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:41,430
The baby is crying.

430
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:01,540
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby eating a baby's food.

431
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:05,700
It's a baby eating a baby's food.

432
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:15,190
It's a baby eating a baby's food.

433
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,260
I'm so sleepy.

434
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,320
I'm so sleepy.

435
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:45,170
I'm so sleepy.

436
01:04:48,330 --> 01:05:38,000
Ah! Ah! Ah!

437
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,350
Ah! Ah! Ah!

438
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,350
Ah! Ah! Ah!

439
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:07,351
Ah! Ah! Ah!

440
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:12,860
Ah! Ah! Ah!

441
01:06:12,861 --> 01:06:13,020
Ah! Ah! Ah!

442
01:06:13,021 --> 01:06:13,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

443
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:13,220
Ah! Ah! Ah!

444
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,360
Ah! Ah! Ah!

445
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:14,560
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

446
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:14,600
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

447
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:22,110
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I'm sorry.

448
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,700
I'm sorry.

449
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,320
I'm sorry.

450
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,660
I'm sorry.

451
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:12,700
I'm sorry.

452
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,600


453
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,300
Give it back to me.

454
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,880
Give it back to me, Nakoshi.

455
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,560
I was high.

456
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:28,360
I'm hungry.

457
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:29,361
I'm hungry.

458
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:39,900
I'm hungry.

459
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,060
I'm hungry.

460
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:47,490
I'm hungry.

461
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,491
I'm sorry.

462
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:18,520
I'm sorry.

463
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:37,760
I'm sorry.

464
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:48,520
I'm sorry.

465
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,730
Ahh!

466
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:43,440
Hello, everyone.

467
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,360
It's been a long time.

468
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:46,361
It's been a long time.

469
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,350
It's been a long time.

470
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:52,410
It's been a long time.

471
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:53,770
It's been a long time.

472
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:55,730
It's been a long time.

473
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:56,330
It's been a long time.

474
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:57,110
It's been a long time.

475
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:57,390
It's been a long time.

476
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,910
It's been a long time.

477
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:00,911
It's been a long time.

478
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,370
It's been a long time.

479
01:23:03,371 --> 01:23:18,020
I don't know when I'll see you again.

480
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:24,790
It's been a while since I've been home.

481
01:23:25,635 --> 01:23:27,570
You're not coming
back this year? No way.

482
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,600


483
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,590
I was looking forward to seeing you.

484
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,750
You've been on a business trip?

485
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:38,630
Really?

486
01:23:38,631 --> 01:23:41,050
When will we meet again?

487
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,130
Next year?

488
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,791
We've known each other for a long time.

489
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,820
You're heavy.

490
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:46,140
We are a family of five.

491
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,220
We are not good friends.

492
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,700
We are not good friends.

493
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:53,930
We are not good friends.

494
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,350
We are not good friends.

495
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:03,830
It's delicious.

496
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,610
Do you want to eat grapes?

497
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:08,150
You just tasted it,
didn't you? I'm sorry.

498
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,210


499
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:17,870
I'm going to close my mouth.

500
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:21,510
You're getting closer and closer.

501
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:29,380
How's Tokyo?

502
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,260
Are you used to it? Well, yeah.

503
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,060


504
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:36,840
I haven't heard from you at all lately.

505
01:29:36,841 --> 01:29:40,500
I'm sorry.
I'm busy studying and working part-time.

506
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,720
You're just playing with students.

507
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,040
No, I'm not.

508
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,480
That's good. I'll call you every day.

509
01:30:30,485 --> 01:30:31,680
It smells so much.

510
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,500
It's embarrassing.

511
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:40,880
It's smelly.

512
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,920
No, it's not.

513
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:07,900
Brother.

514
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:12,320
Oh, it's painful.

515
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:28,840
You like it, don't you?

516
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,520
You don't have a dog, do you?

517
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,060
You like here,
don't you? Yes, I do.

518
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,640
Itadakimasu.

519
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,560
Let's eat.

520
01:34:31,561 --> 01:34:32,561


521
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,020
Meguri, isn't it too big?

522
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,240
It's better to eat it in this size.

523
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:43,940
It's almost the same size.

524
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,780
That's not enough.

525
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,520
Really? It's sweet.

526
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,760


527
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,360
It's really sweet.

528
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:57,580
It's sweet, isn't
it? Oh, I'm happy.

529
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:05,320


530
01:36:34,390 --> 01:37:13,720
I'm happy to spend time like this.

531
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:16,620
I think so, too.

532
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,200
By the way, I went to
a reunion the other day.

533
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,100
Oh, did you?

534
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,440
Yes.

535
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:27,660
And Take told me that he likes me.

536
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:29,920
What?

537
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,220
I was a little surprised.

538
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,560
I see.

539
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,280
What? Are you a little
nervous? No, I'm not.

540
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,500


541
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:41,270
Come on, be honest.

542
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,160
Just a little.

543
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,840
You... Stop it.

544
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:51,640
I'll get back at you.

545
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:52,641
I'm going to kill you.

546
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,880
Don't do that.

547
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:00,960
I'm sorry.

548
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,180
What's this? It's a skull.

549
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,340


550
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,360
Do I have to do it,
too? Yes, you do.

551
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:31,030


552
01:38:55,550 --> 01:39:11,620
It's better not to drink too much water.

553
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:11,360
I'm sorry.

554
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:38,640
How do you feel? I feel great.

555
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,220


556
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:59,330
Look at your head.

557
01:40:59,331 --> 01:41:00,331
Come on, let's go.

558
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:02,040
Grandma and grandpa will come soon.

559
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,880
But it's cold.

560
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:38,550
I'm sorry.

561
01:42:43,145 --> 01:42:44,810
I'm sorry.

562
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:46,150
I'm sorry.

563
01:43:53,385 --> 01:43:55,430
I'm happy...

564
01:43:57,150 --> 01:43:58,890
I'm happy.

565
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:00,850
I'm happy.

566
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:02,670
I'm happy.

567
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:20,780
Don't cry.

568
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,720
Why can't I do it? It hurts.

569
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:35,420
I'll do it.

570
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:36,920
It hurts.

571
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,140
I'm tired.

572
01:44:48,920 --> 01:45:17,560


573
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:47,150
How many?

574
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:49,250
What's that?

575
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:50,300
What?

576
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:51,110
What?

577
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,770
What?

578
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:53,270
What's that?

579
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:56,670
Is it picnic?

580
01:45:57,670 --> 01:45:58,730
Did you finish? I finished.

581
01:45:58,970 --> 01:45:59,970


582
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,260
Why do you study?

583
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,300
What?

584
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,721
Isn't it to make studying a habit?

585
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:57,280
I'm not going to be able to get
good grades or bad grades in my life.

586
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:00,380
No.

587
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:05,040
By studying like this, you're
learning how to deal with things.

588
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:06,481
Are you going to be a
teacher today? Here it is.

589
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:08,820


590
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,560
The answer of the top student.

591
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:11,940
I don't know anything.

592
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,320
I'm not going to study.

593
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:16,110
Hey.

594
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:19,340
Do it.

595
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:21,900
I'm not in the mood.

596
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,600
By the way, are you going to Tokyo?

597
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:32,260
I'm going to Choson.

598
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:40,950
I want to escape from this
country and see various places.

599
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:44,370
Is Tokyo such a good place?

600
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:48,210
I don't know, but I want to see it once.

601
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:53,290
Is it the last time to see Satoshi?

602
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,330
No, I'll be back in the summer vacation.

603
01:47:58,290 --> 01:47:59,710
I'm lonely.

604
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:42,560
I'll give it to you.

605
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,700
What's up? A present.

606
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:53,700
Do you remember I taught you sunflower
language in the previous class? Oh, I forgot.

607
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:56,851
It had nothing to do
with the entrance exam.

608
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:58,300
What's up? Oh, never mind.

609
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:01,200


610
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:03,760
What's up? It's okay.

611
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,460
I'm going to get some fresh air.

612
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,360
What?

613
01:49:12,845 --> 01:49:15,380
Hey, wait!

614
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:02,600
※This video was recorded
on July 22nd, 2016.

615
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:03,640
Megwin! Here.

616
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:12,690
I remembered the
words of Himawari.

617
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:16,090
One is love at first sight.

618
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:18,490
Three is love at first sight.

619
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,660
I have something to tell you.

620
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:29,800
I like you.

621
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:50,830
You are late.

622
01:51:50,831 --> 01:51:53,090
I'm sorry.

623
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:55,170
I'm going to bed.

624
02:00:36,435 --> 02:01:05,290
I love you.

625
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:20,510
I love you, too.

626
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:23,630
I love you, too.

627
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:34,330
It's sour.

628
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:37,900
I'll try to eat slowly until I can.

629
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,580
I'm going to get up.

630
02:09:30,110 --> 02:09:31,551
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

631
02:10:22,505 --> 02:10:28,310
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

632
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:46,140
※This is the sound of a baby crying.

633
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:07,190
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

634
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:21,370
【Crying】 I'm sorry.

635
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:29,670
I'm sorry.

636
02:13:34,030 --> 02:13:35,610
I'm sorry.

637
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:42,750
I'm sorry.

638
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:31,860
My butt hurts.

639
02:14:31,861 --> 02:14:32,861


640
02:14:39,170 --> 02:14:40,190
Your butt? I'm sorry.

641
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:31,340


642
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:58,010
※This is the first time I've ever heard
of it, so I'm not sure if it's true or not.

643
02:15:58,011 --> 02:16:01,331
※This is the first time I've ever heard
of it, so I'm not sure if it's true or not.

644
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,400
I'm sorry.

645
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:26,600
I'm sorry.

646
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,020
I'm sorry.

647
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:41,880
I want to die. I want to die.

648
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:02,680
My aunt...

649
02:20:08,785 --> 02:20:24,850
My aunt...

650
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:36,070
〔Crying〕

651
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:44,330
〔Breathing〕 I'm sorry.

652
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,580
I'm sick.

653
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:12,830
I'm sick.

654
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:14,030
You're tired.

655
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:29,520
I thought so.

656
02:23:38,470 --> 02:23:39,470


657
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:48,630
You know, I've been in love
with you since I was a little girl.

658
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:53,620
Why don't you tell me?

659
02:23:55,450 --> 02:23:58,850
I want you to tell me that you love me.

660
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:01,490
I see.

661
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:03,990
You don't have a girl's heart at all.

662
02:24:03,991 --> 02:24:04,991
I don't buy it at all.

663
02:24:06,250 --> 02:24:07,250
I'm sorry.

664
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:11,070
I'll be with you forever.

665
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:16,403
If so, I have to go to
a good university in

666
02:24:16,415 --> 02:24:20,170
Tokyo, get a good job,
and make a lot of money.

667
02:24:22,370 --> 02:24:23,370
I don't need money.

668
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,390
That's all I need if I have you.

669
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:31,290
Meguri, I love you.

670
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:33,710
I love you too.

671
02:24:37,100 --> 02:25:46,860
When I touch a little child, hand
in hand, in the sun, I feel so sweet.

672
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:49,100
Every time summer comes, I feel pain.

673
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:54,120
The sky clears out, and I can't breathe.

674
02:25:54,121 --> 02:25:56,980
If I could see you again now,

675
02:25:58,430 --> 02:26:01,100
If I could see you
again in a different form,

676
02:26:01,101 --> 02:26:05,180
If I could meet you again, I
would imagine only such things.

677
02:26:10,570 --> 02:26:14,300
I wonder if the summer will end like this.

678
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:45,140
I'm here because I'm here

679
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:02,460

02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:20,340
I'm not good at it.

I've talked to my mom about having a baby.

695

because it was raining.

Oh, it is broken.

705
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:14,700
I made it wrong!

706
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,320
What's the matter?

707
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:32,920
