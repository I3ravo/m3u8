1
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:30,462
I have a temperament. I love
to be turned around by women.

2
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:36,990
I love to be turned around by various men,
and I love to be worn out and consumed.

3
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:46,570
If you want to add more excitement,
it is a great pleasure to have a wife.

4
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:53,090
A wife is a person's
wife and a person's thing.

5
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,990
That wife is in a place where
her husband doesn't know.

6
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,010
I just think about it,
I just think about it,

7
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,690
This time, I would like to show
you a video with such my personality.

8
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:13,090
I would like to show you a
video with a lot of scenes.

9
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:22,250
Just in time for the mid-autumn
festival, my wife came in.

10
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,390
Are you all here? Yes, I'm fine.

11
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620


12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,240
This time, not only the training trip,
but also Mr. Oshima's welcome party.

13
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,360
Mr. Oshima, please enjoy it.

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,660
Thank you very much.

15
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,360
Also, we'll hold a party at night.

16
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Let's do it!

17
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,620
But before that, we need you to study hard.

18
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,360
Let's go to a tourist spot
and take pictures together.

19
00:02:43,350 --> 00:03:09,880
It's a nice place,
isn't it? It's beautiful.

20
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,501
It's good, isn't it?

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,280
I'll bring your luggage.

22
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,860
You can use that room.

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
Thank you very much.

24
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Your luggage is over there.

25
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,420
It's good, isn't it?

26
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,220
The owner here has been
my friend for a long time.

27
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,240
Thank you very much.

28
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
He takes good care of me.

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm sweating.

30
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,540
You're sweating,
aren't you? I'm tired.

31
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,340


32
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
You're tired, aren't you?

33
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,800
Then, let's take a bath.

34
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,340
Let's go right away.

35
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
I don't care about the bath.

36
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,880
Let's take a short break before the party.

37
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,881
Let's do it.

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm looking forward to it.

39
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,220
It's a practice.

40
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
What?

41
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,640
It's a practice.

42
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,420
It's a practice.

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:40,420
Thank you very much.

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
I'll do my best.

45
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,740
You're late.

46
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,810
How do I look?

47
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,150
Do I look cool? You look good.

48
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:57,890


49
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,450
Do I look good? You look good.

50
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,570
Let me ask you.

51
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,050


52
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Is the meal good? It's good.

53
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010


54
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,170
Did you like the hot
spring? It was good.

55
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,730


56
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,830
Did you have a great
trip? It was good.

57
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,970


58
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,690
Today is a welcome party for Oshima-san.

59
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,410
The star of the day is always Oshima-san.

60
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,090
Let's have a good time today.

61
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,320
Oshima-san, you are the star of the day.

62
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,520
Can I be the star of the day?

63
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,220
Can I steal the star of
the day? No, you can't.

64
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680


65
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,000
Oshima-san, please steal
the star of the day from me.

66
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,140
Wait a minute.
I've prepared a game for you.

67
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,560
What is it? You'll see.

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,460


69
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,821
But, Oshima-san, are you
okay with this outfit? It's not good.

70
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680


71
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,871
So, I've prepared an outfit that
will make you look better than me.

72
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
Come here.

73
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Let's go.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Come here.

75
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
I've prepared it.

76
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,201
Good luck!

77
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,550
Please look forward to it!

78
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Are you ready?

79
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,200
Everyone, it seems
that Oshima-san is ready.

80
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,460
Finally, Oshima-san is here!

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,020
There's something on it.

82
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,136
There's something cute on it.

83
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
It's cute.

84
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,280
Oshawa-san, this is not all.

85
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,010
Oshawa-san.

86
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Let's open it!

87
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,640
Let's go!

88
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Open!

89
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,580
Oshawa-san, it looks good on you.

90
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:15,860
Let's buy it.

91
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,620
It's cute.

92
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,780
It looks good on you.

93
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,360
Everyone, let's play the game!

94
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,280
The name of the
game is... Ta-dah!

95
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,220
Manpo-kei!

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,280
Put it on your waist and shake it!

97
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,550
The rules are simple.

98
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,040
Put this manpo-kei on your waist.

99
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,840
And you can shake your waist
as much as you want in a minute.

100
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
OK!

101
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I'll do my best!

102
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,980
OK, I set it to zero.

103
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,480
Here you go.

104
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,060
Put this on your waist.

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
It's OK around here.

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
It's a private house, so I'm
sure you'll shake your waist a lot.

107
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:56,040
Shinohara-san, you are going to lose.

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,300
No, no, no. I'm not going to lose.

109
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,980
I'm going to judge you in a minute.

110
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,080
Shinohara-san, please.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
OK, leave it to me.

112
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,140
This is a serious game.

113
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,320
If I lose, I'm going to work
overtime for 5 hours every day.

114
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,660
If I lose, you'll have a penalty game.

115
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,471
Shinohara-san, please
think about what to do.

116
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
I'll think about it.

117
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,740
Are you ready?

118
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,860
3,2,1, Start!

119
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,240
More! More!

120
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,640
30 seconds have passed.

121
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,000
15 seconds left.

122
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
15 seconds left.

123
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,440
You can do it!

124
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
10

125
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,900
9

126
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,860
8

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,700
7

128
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:05,780
6

129
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,680
5

130
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,080
4

131
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:08,720
3

132
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,721
2

133
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
1

134
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,030
Winner!

135
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
You did your best!

136
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,880
How was the result? Thank you.

137
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700


138
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,560
The king was strong.

139
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,720
I see.

140
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,460
The result is... 136 to 116.

141
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,120
The winner is HIMORI!

142
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Thank you! I did my best.

143
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420


144
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,660
The loser is Oshima-san.

145
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,460
It's a penalty game.

146
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,690
What is it?

147
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
What's the penalty game?

148
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,300
The penalty game
is... Retirement!

149
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,301
It's a counterattack!

150
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,060
Oshima-san, please
strike a counterattack pose.

151
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,840
This is a serious game.

152
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:23,840
Please strike a pose of M-shape.

153
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
That's good, Oshima-san.

154
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,880
Don't hide it!

155
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,740
You can't hide it! It's a
penalty game! Ok, Maeda-san.

156
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800


157
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,960
Let's start with a rolling pose.

158
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
Roll your waist.

159
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,900
President, next pose, please.

160
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Show me your butt!

161
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,240
I want to see your butt!

162
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,280
President! President!

163
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
It's here! It's here!

164
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Beautiful!

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Cute!

166
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,120
Yūko Toshiba!

167
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
President!

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,100
Yūko Toshiba!

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Yūko Toshiba!

170
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,560
Yūko Toshiba!

171
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,620
What's the next request?

172
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,900
I want to see something cat-like.

173
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,020
That's good!

174
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,720
Please look at the camera.

175
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
The pose of the cat.

176
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
The pose of the cat.

177
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Look at the camera.

178
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,720
The pose of the cat.

179
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
What do you say? Meow.

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100


181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Wow.

182
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Cute.

183
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,400
Cat walks with two legs.

184
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,960
Yes.

185
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,520
It's so cute!

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
It's wonderful!

187
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
It's beautiful!

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm so jealous of you!

189
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,320
All right!

190
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,600
The game is over now.

191
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,580
Thank you very much, Oshio-san!

192
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,940
Let's give a big hand to Oshio-san!

193
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Awesome!

194
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,980
Thank you very much, Oshio-san!

195
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
It was great! No, no.

196
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060


197
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,000
Everyone, the game time is over.

198
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:45,945
Enjoy the rest of the simple time.

199
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,920
I can't stand it if you
show me such a thing.

200
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,140
What?

201
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,100
You were also excited, weren't you?

202
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,820
No, wait a minute.

203
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,300
What's wrong?

204
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,940
What if I do that?

205
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,670
Is it bad for your husband?

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
It's okay, isn't it?

207
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,406
You were so excited that your legs
were shaking, weren't they? That's.

208
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,590
..

209
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,410
You came to the game expecting
this, didn't you? No, I didn't.

210
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,310


211
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:46,530
You don't look like a bad girl at all.

212
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:27,560
You want me to comfort
you, don't you? Please.

213
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Why? I'm tired.

214
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm tired.

215
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,561
It's okay.

216
00:17:33,440 --> 00:20:12,180
Be quiet.

217
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,520


218
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,680


219
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,780
How is it? Is it hot?
Is it hard? I'm sorry.

220
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,130


221
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:51,570
I'm going to use my tongue.

222
00:22:56,130 --> 00:24:01,410
I'm going to use my tongue.

223
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,400
I can't do it.

224
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,510
I can't do it anymore.

225
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,770
I can't do that.

226
00:25:50,740 --> 00:27:13,710
I want you to move.

227
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,920
Please.

228
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,750
It's over. It's over.

229
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,030
It's over.

230
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,090
Please.

231
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,200
It's getting worse.

232
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:56,500
I'm here.

233
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
No.

234
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:28,270
I'm in the middle of something.

235
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,630
Go away.

236
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,970
Shut up.

237
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,730
Yes, sir.

238
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Hey.

239
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'll be found out.

240
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,400
Don't worry.

241
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,580
He's a good talker.

242
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,420
No, I'm not.

243
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,640
I told you not to say it.

244
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Don't worry.

245
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm asking you if you can quit here.

246
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:07,141
I'm asking if you're okay.

247
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,610
I'll leave you alone for a while.

248
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,380
You'll hear me if I speak.

249
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,470
I'll leave you alone for a while.

250
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,190
How do you feel?

251
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:37,191
How about this one? I'm done.

252
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,350
I'm done.

253
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:14,560
You have to make a sound.

254
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,260
Do it like this.

255
00:35:27,560 --> 00:36:04,290
Close your eyes.

256
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,940
Hold me tight.

257
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Good.

258
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,480
More.

259
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:22,190
I can't.

260
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,910
I can't.

261
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,370
Why? I can't.

262
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,970


263
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,240
You can't? I can't.

264
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:38,080
Stop.

265
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,780
More.

266
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,390
Don't worry.

267
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:36,960
Don't worry.

268
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,940
I've never been able to do it.

269
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,920
Good luck from now on.

270
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,660
Thank you very much.

271
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,220
I'll give you a bonus.

272
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,440
I'll give you a bonus.

273
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
Thank you very much.

274
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,300
I'll give you a bonus.

275
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,760
Thank you very much.

276
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:39,920
Oshima-san, you're late.

277
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,680
Hurry up and sit down.

278
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,160
I'm sorry.

279
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,531
There's no alcohol for the president.

280
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,720
Come on.

281
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:45,920
Come on.

282
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:46,860
Sit down.

283
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
I'm sorry.

284
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
It's okay.

285
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:49,780
Come on.

286
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,420
I'm not a man. I don't like this salmon.

287
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,660
It's so good.

288
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,020
You have to drink it.
It's good for your health.

289
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,060
He's right.

290
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,420
You have to drink it.
It's good for your health.

291
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Open it. Open it.

292
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,700
You have to drink it.

293
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:12,701
I don't know.

294
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,540
Hey, Kiyoshi.

295
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,450
I'm going to the bathroom.

296
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Me, too.

297
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

298
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
I'm sorry.

299
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,390
You're overdoing it.

300
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,560
Drink up.

301
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,860
Hey,

302
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,140
Kiyoshi is definitely talking.

303
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,640
Don't say that to me.

304
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,740
Don't you want to take a bath?

305
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
What?

306
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,940
If you don't wash properly,
you may get pregnant.

307
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm going to take a bath.

308
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,930
You have a good body.

309
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,860
It's the best.

310
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,430
President!

311
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,630
Oh! Hey! I'm sorry.

312
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,350
Hey! I'm sorry.

313
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,430


314
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,230


315
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,190
You're not doing what you should be doing.

316
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,110
What?

317
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,530
Well,

318
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,660
It's such a good body.

319
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,361
It's a waste to enjoy it alone.

320
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,290
I'm sorry.

321
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,670
I'm sorry.

322
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,670
You were pretending to be nice just now.

323
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,750
I saw it just now.

324
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,810
I'm fine, too.

325
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,050
President!

326
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,790
I don't like it.

327
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,951
The president says it's good.

328
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,310
Enjoy it.

329
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,171
This is also part of the training.

330
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,430
It's fluffy.

331
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,731
Oshima-san, please enjoy it.

332
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,070
Today is a holiday, so you
should do a lot of things.

333
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:40,750
I'm counting on you.

334
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,590
Oh, it's hot.

335
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,770
Is it really okay for such
a good woman? It's so hot.

336
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,070


337
00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:12,570
You have a sharp body.

338
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,351
Your nipples are getting longer.

339
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:57,210
Can I go this way?
Do as you like.

340
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,290


341
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,070
I can't get used to it.

342
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,590
You can't get used to it.

343
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,190
Let me see.

344
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,180
What? What? This is.

345
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060


346
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,840
..

347
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,260
Excuse me.

348
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Excuse me.

349
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,400
I don't want to.

350
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,620
Oh! You are so big.

351
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:33,600
Excuse me.

352
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,260
Don't lick me.

353
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,380


354
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,300
OK.

355
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:43,440
Oh!

356
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,640
How do you feel?

357
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,940
Oh!

358
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,220
Do you feel good?

359
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,400
Oh!

360
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:51,180
How do you feel?

361
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:51,540
Oh!

362
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,380
Tell me if you feel good.

363
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,780
Tell me if you feel good.

364
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,230
You feel good, don't you?

365
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,430
I feel good every time.

366
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,590
Look, you are sweating.

367
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,030
Yes, I am.

368
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,660
You are sweating a lot.

369
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,960
Great.

370
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,500
It's easy to put it in.

371
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,580
It's thick.

372
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,431
Oshima-san, do you usually
ask your husband to do this?

373
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,010
You can enjoy it.

374
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,681
Tell him you'll go when you go.

375
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,290
Beer came out from here.

376
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,291
Beer came out.

377
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,610
What are you going
to do? I don't know.

378
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,300
You are drunk.

379
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,290


380
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,510
I'm getting drunk.

381
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,010
Then, I'll do it.

382
00:47:53,020 --> 00:48:01,630
I'm going to use your hotel room.

383
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,470
What are you doing?

384
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:13,370
Let me feed you.

385
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,390
Can you feed me?

386
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,810
How does it taste?

387
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,160
How does it taste?

388
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,161
Is it good? Kimori.

389
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,590


390
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,120
Yes.

391
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,670
I'm glad you joined us.

392
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,800
It was the right decision to come here.

393
00:48:49,760 --> 00:49:02,530
It feels good in my mouth.

394
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,120
It's going to come out.

395
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:22,990
How erotic are you dressing up?

396
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:07,130
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

397
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,361
The baby's inside is amazing.

398
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,100
I didn't know the baby's
inside was this colorful.

399
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:17,360
She was crying a lot, wasn't she?

400
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,340
Oh, no! Oh, no! Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,121
Wow, she's crying a lot.

402
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,570
Wow, she's crying a lot.

403
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,000
She was crying a lot, wasn't she?

404
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,280
He's still sticking his tongue out.

405
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,780
How do you feel about your husband?

406
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:04,166
Does your husband look down on you?

407
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,400
I'm glad he doesn't.

408
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:13,006
I thought you couldn't get
your hands off your husband.

409
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,140
Thank you very much.

410
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:17,141
Thank you very much.

411
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,630
Your mouth looks like a dumpling.

412
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:38,631
It's like a baby.

413
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,880
Great!

414
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,820
You are very good at it.

415
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,740
It's so creamy, isn't it?

416
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,540
How creamy it is!

417
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,180
Wow!

418
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,740
I can hear the sound of the bath.

419
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,740
This is a place where everyone gets tired.

420
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
I have to be quiet.

421
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,940
Then, I'll take off my socks.

422
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,880
Wow!

423
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:09,500
There was no reason for me to come here.

424
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:12,300
As expected.

425
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:15,720
I can't wait to cast her.

426
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,360
Me, too.

427
00:53:18,965 --> 00:53:20,080
Our company is the best.

428
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,700
It's the best.

429
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,420
The girls who work at our company say,

430
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,980
she's a nasty girl.

431
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,940
I can't stand her.

432
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,840
This is our company's trademark, a scarf.

433
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
I'll do my best.

434
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,300
I'll do my best.

435
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:38,380
You are so cute.

436
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,160
Boss, let's do it together.

437
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Me, too?

438
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,820
Yes, let's do it together.

439
00:53:50,980 --> 00:54:00,820
You use your teeth so well.

440
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,800
You are so patient.

441
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,240
You are so patient.

442
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:10,280
So, we are doing this for your welfare.

443
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,820
Yes, for our welfare.

444
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,880
We are the only ones who can do this.

445
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,220
Yes, we are.

446
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,280
Yes, yes, yes.

447
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,700
Oshima-san, in order.

448
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:42,180
I'm sorry, but I can't
help but want to release it.

449
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
Because you are young.

450
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,580
I have a request.

451
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,520
What is it?

452
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:50,960
Can I take a bath?

453
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,660
Do you want to take a bath?

454
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,020
Yes.

455
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,680
Then, ask Oshima-san.

456
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,140
Yes.

457
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:00,520
Oshima-san, can I hit your pussy?

458
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,300
How is it?

459
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,000
It's good, isn't it?
Then, stand up.

460
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,880
Stand up.

461
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,510


462
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Come on, come on.

463
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,740
Stick out your butt.

464
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,900
Come on.

465
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:16,950
Come here.

466
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,760
I want you to put it in.

467
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,260
Can I put it in?

468
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:33,780
Can I put it in? Yes, you can.

469
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,380


470
00:55:37,025 --> 00:55:39,380
Thank you very much.

471
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,940
You like the back, don't you?

472
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,840
I'll put it in with my young heart.

473
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,400
What's this?

474
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,640
It's all wrapped up.

475
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Go on.

476
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,640
Kill it with your dick.

477
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:12,710
Can you feel it with your dick
other than your husband's?

478
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,490
You have to report it to your husband.

479
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,490
Please do not feel it.

480
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,630
Please do not squeeze so much.

481
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,940
This is not good.

482
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,280
Next, I will do it.

483
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,980
Woooo!

484
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:50,480
They are in the sauna now.

485
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
Uwu…

486
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,760
Chin, you should breathe in.

487
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:02,761
Yes, I can breathe.

488
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,380
Please be quiet.

489
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,660
Wow…

490
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,340
What?

491
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,860
Are you taking a bath?

492
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,040
Aha!

493
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,440
Oh my…

494
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,760
Please sit down, Chinko.

495
00:58:44,810 --> 00:59:29,240
How do you feel? It's strange.

496
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,670
It's amazing.

497
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,780


498
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,120
How do you feel?

499
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,840
You don't feel like taking a bath.

500
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,840
It's OK.

501
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,360
I'm not going to do it.

502
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:23,870
I'm going to tie you up.

503
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,540
Your butt is floating.

504
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:47,030
I'm sorry.
I don't think you're using any strength.

505
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:48,590
Please don't drown.

506
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:29,380
This is the first time I have
ever seen such a scene.

507
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,826
I was surprised to see a scene
where I couldn't do anything.

508
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,610
I was surprised to see a scene
where I couldn't do anything.

509
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:57,670
Oh, my God!

510
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,551
Mr.Konjima, you are wearing
a very embarrassing outfit.

511
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,190
Your clothes are really
fantastic, Mr.Shachio.

512
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,940
You sure, you have a
lot of influence on me.

513
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:21,380
Thank you.

514
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:51,670
Mr.Konjima, can I see
the sex senior? Don't move.

515
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:55,910
Sit properly.

516
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,490
Tighten more.

517
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000


518
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,051
You have to feel the president's feelings.

519
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,660
How do you feel, president?

520
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,290
Enjoy it, Chiba-san.

521
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,030
You still have two steps to go.

522
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,670
That's right.

523
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,590
You can do whatever you want.

524
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:39,190
You can do whatever you want.

525
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:40,970
You can do whatever you want.

526
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,521
You really like to play
with the water, don't you?

527
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,270
You don't care about your husband.

528
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:53,266
You can put your butt on the water.

529
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,690
It feels good all over the body.

530
01:05:16,365 --> 01:05:18,170
It's amazing, isn't it?

531
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,230
Tighten your belly button more.

532
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,070
How is it?

533
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,250
The president's waist is heavy.

534
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,010
It's powerful.

535
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,150
To the back.

536
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,950
This side, too.

537
01:06:21,090 --> 01:07:32,890
The sound of a baby crying The sound of
a baby crying The sound of a baby crying

538
01:07:33,290 --> 01:08:04,900
I'm tired because I haven't
washed my hands yet.

539
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,340
Show me the taste of a veteran.

540
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,670
You look good in hot springs.

541
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,620
Oshima-san, you've been looking forward
to this kind of training, haven't you?

542
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,820
Yes, I have.

543
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,320
It's scary.

544
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:44,240
I'm so jealous of you.

545
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:45,241
It's not a big deal.

546
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,380
Then, let's do chin-up.

547
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,960
Which one do you
prefer? It feels good.

548
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:51,961


549
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,600
I don't think I can beat you.

550
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,080
I can do it in 10 seconds.

551
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,380
In 10 seconds? That's right.

552
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,740


553
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,120
It's a competition.

554
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,910
It's hard.

555
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,220
It's hard.

556
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,480
It's hard.

557
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,480
It's always fun.

558
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,040
It's different when you shake it.

559
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:57,230
It's like this, isn't it?

560
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:57,750
It's like this, isn't it?

561
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,170
It's like this, isn't it?

562
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,340
It's like this, isn't it?

563
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:08,160
It's like this, isn't it?

564
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:18,420
It's like this, isn't it?

565
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,880
It's like this, isn't it?

566
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:20,881
It's like this, isn't it?

567
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:14,970
You can do it harder.

568
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,330
You are short of breath now.

569
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,890
Can I do more?

570
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,310
Let her do more.

571
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,610
I can't do it anymore.

572
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,245
Do it with double motion.

573
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,250
Let her do more.

574
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,990
Let her do more.

575
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,490
Show your manliness.

576
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,680
You did it.

577
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,000
I can't stand it anymore.

578
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,700
Look at him.

579
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,740
Hold him tight.

580
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:58,660
Can you rub him? Rub him more.

581
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,840


582
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,740
Please break the window.

583
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,990
Please break it.

584
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,120
Do you want a tissue? Yes, I do.

585
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,340
Please hold this.

586
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:49,170
Thank you.

587
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:06,410
What kind of person are you?

588
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,430
I won't let you go.

589
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:49,110
Don't do that.

590
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:49,150
I won't let you go.

591
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:52,790
Listen to me, let's go together.

592
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:55,890
I can go with you,
can't I? Don't go.

593
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:57,570


594
01:15:58,650 --> 01:15:59,810
I don't want to go.

595
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,850
No, I don't want to.

596
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:02,930
I'm not going to.

597
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,590
No, I don't want to.

598
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,480
Come on.

599
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,410
No, please.

600
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,500
I don't want to.

601
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,140
I don't want to.

602
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:30,820
I don't want to.

603
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:31,821
Please.

604
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,100
Oh!

605
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,540
Oh!

606
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,720
Oh!

607
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:54,300
Oh! Here you are.

608
01:16:54,301 --> 01:16:57,460
Here you are.

609
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,420
Here you are.

610
01:16:58,421 --> 01:16:59,421
You are great.

611
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,140
You are soaked.

612
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:08,480


613
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:12,070
Please clean your body.

614
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:16,300
I feel sick because my body is soaked.

615
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,340
Oh, my God!

616
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,320
Oshima-san, please take her inside.

617
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,320
Yes, yes, yes.

618
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:02,321
Come on, lift her up.

619
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,000
No, no, no.

620
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,760
Please, dad.

621
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,300
Please, dad.

622
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,500
Why are you making
her cry? Please, dad.

623
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,780
Hang in there.

624
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,330
No, no, no.

625
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,420


626
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,510
She will come out soon.

627
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,030
Please, dad.

628
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:27,031
It's impossible.

629
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,170
Please, no! Slowly, slowly.

630
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,470


631
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,450
No, no, no!

632
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:34,230
Oh!

633
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:35,390
No!

634
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,270
Oh!

635
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,540
Oh!

636
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,820
Ok, let's sleep now.

637
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,200
Let's enjoy a little more
and then sleep again.

638
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,540
Please go back to me.

639
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,230
You are shaking your hips a lot.

640
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:25,870
I'm sorry.

641
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:46,760
Thank you very much.

642
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:51,600
I'll follow you to the car all my life.

643
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:03,440
Hey, Oshima-san, you
can't sleep in a place like this.

644
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:07,540
I think I drank too much.
I'm going to sleep.

645
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,540
Then you guys pull
the futon and take it out.

646
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:13,600
I'll do it.

647
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:15,380
Hey, take it out.

648
01:20:15,381 --> 01:20:16,381
I'll do it.

649
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:18,940
I can't help it.

650
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,350
You can't do that.

651
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:24,980
Give it to me.

652
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,440
Mr. Oshima.

653
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,140
Mr. Oshima.

654
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:29,440
Mr. Oshima, look.

655
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,680
Are you OK?

656
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,980
Mr. President.

657
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,040
Mr. Oshima, you're OK.

658
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,100
What's the matter?
You're idiots.

659
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,740


660
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,480
Mr. Oshima wants it.

661
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,120
Don't you know that?

662
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:45,380
You can't? That's why you can't
participate in the competition.

663
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,260
That's right.

664
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,180
You should learn from the president.

665
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,110
What are you doing?

666
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,750
Your eyes are open.

667
01:20:58,751 --> 01:20:59,990
You should forgive him.

668
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:01,670
Don't do that.

669
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:02,770
Don't worry.

670
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:03,950
Let him sleep.

671
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:04,630
President! Don't worry.

672
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:05,470


673
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,790
You should go to bed.

674
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,590
You should go to bed.

675
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,190
You should go to bed.

676
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,350
You should go to bed.

677
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:18,290
What are you doing? Join us.

678
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,170
I can't let you sleep.

679
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,310
Don't worry.

680
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,270
You're so mean.

681
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:28,510
Women are pitiful if they
don't make you laugh.

682
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,450
Look at this panty.

683
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,230
What's this? Look closer.

684
01:21:33,231 --> 01:21:34,231


685
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:37,650
Why is there so much blood in it?

686
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,810
Did you draw this?

687
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:42,870
What's this? Look at this.

688
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,110
It's so erotic.

689
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:46,330
No, no, no.

690
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:47,650
It's OK.

691
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:48,730
No, no, no.

692
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,530


693
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:53,950
Are you smoking? No, I'm not.

694
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:55,930


695
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,750
President!

696
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,310
President!

697
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:03,890
It smells so good.

698
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,650
It smells so good.

699
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,110
President! It smells good.

700
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,151
I think it's good.

701
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:18,310
Touch it.

702
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,970
It smells so good.

703
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,300
You should kiss it.

704
01:22:27,565 --> 01:22:31,170
It's your wife's lips.

705
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,260
It's good.

706
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:39,030
You can lick him.

707
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,730
He is asking for it.

708
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,810
If you don't understand
it, you can't be promoted.

709
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:47,211
I'm telling you, you can't do that.

710
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,641
Kyoryu, you can't bend it.

711
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:50,770
Go, go.

712
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:53,830
I can do it, too.

713
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:55,810
You can lick it.

714
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:57,930
You lick it, too.

715
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:01,030
That's right.

716
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,070
I'm sorry.

717
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:15,310
Look at his face.

718
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:32,750
Look at his face.

719
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,650
Look at his face.

720
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:41,110
If you are hungry, you should eat more.

721
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,450
Oh, no.

722
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:51,950
You are hungry, so lick it.

723
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,530
Lick your toes, too.

724
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:56,650
Lick everything.

725
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,390
Lick your father, too.

726
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:01,990
Lick everything.

727
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:03,770
Don't give me more.

728
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,530
It's delicious.

729
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:18,110
You can have sex with everyone.

730
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:22,750
Men and women are the same.

731
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:25,790
What do you want to do if
you are beaten by five women?

732
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:27,650
What do you want to do if you are beaten?

733
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,430
I want to be beaten badly.

734
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:31,450
You want to be licked badly, don't you?

735
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,990
You want to be touched badly, don't you?

736
01:24:32,991 --> 01:24:34,330
You want to be licked badly, don't you?

737
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:35,130
Go! Go! Go! Excuse me.

738
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,350


739
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,270


740
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,750
Your nipples are open.

741
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:43,751
I feel sorry for her.

742
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,230
She is excited.

743
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:55,270
She is standing up.

744
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,260
She is happy.

745
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,120
Give her more.

746
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,860
Do you want more?

747
01:25:13,861 --> 01:25:14,861
Do you want more? I want more.

748
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,530
I told you.

749
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,700
I want more.

750
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,080
What's going on?

751
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,220
What's going on?

752
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:27,590
What do you want
me to do? I'm scared.

753
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:29,550


754
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:31,810
I'm going to lick you.

755
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:32,850
What are you doing?

756
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,730
I'm going to lick you.

757
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,470
Oh, my boss' hand.

758
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:38,510
Oh, my boss.

759
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:40,910
What's wrong? Do you want more?

760
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,610
It's your thought party.

761
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,290
This is a present for you, Oshima-san.

762
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,010
Can I? Of course.

763
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,410
Oshima-san.

764
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:53,070


765
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:55,550
You want me, don't you?

766
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:56,870
I can't face you.

767
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:58,270
I'm sorry.

768
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:00,510
I'm giving you a break.

769
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,410
Oshima-san.

770
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,430
I'm going to lick you.

771
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,070
You are coming.

772
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:15,250
Please lick my face.

773
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:18,430
Please lick my face.

774
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,710
Please lick my head.

775
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,450
Please lick my head.

776
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:28,330
Please lick my head.

777
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:29,331
Give it to me.

778
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:32,930
This one, too.

779
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,290
This one, too.

780
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:36,410
Hey! That one, too.

781
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:43,800


782
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,120
I want that one, too.

783
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,140
You wanted it so much, didn't you?

784
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,480
Right?

785
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:56,900
That's the way you are.

786
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:57,680
Give me more.

787
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,080
Oshima-san, you're such a hard worker.

788
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:00,081
I'm serious.

789
01:27:00,775 --> 01:27:02,180
Do you really love
Chimpo? Yes, I do.

790
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,160
I love Chimpo.

791
01:27:05,161 --> 01:27:06,161


792
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:07,740
It's so much fun.

793
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,576
You're doing this even
though your husband is here.

794
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,200
It's so exciting,
isn't it? You're right.

795
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,300


796
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,500
She looks so erotic.

797
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:17,811
She wants Chimpo other than her husband.

798
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,360
If you don't understand
her heart, you can't work.

799
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:23,361
I can't do it.

800
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,520
I can't do it.

801
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,300
When will you do it?

802
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:41,260
Wait, wait, wait.

803
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:41,880
No, no, no.

804
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,360
You're about to do it.

805
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,280
You're out of luck.

806
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:45,740
I'm in a hurry.

807
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,140
I'm so excited.

808
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:51,060
He is licking his mouth.

809
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:00,630
He is licking his mouth deliciously.

810
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,300
Here is another one.

811
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:17,780
He is licking his mouth.

812
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:25,391
There is also a welcome party.

813
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,941
Let's welcome everyone with a small step.

814
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:31,980
Then I will also participate.

815
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,600
Please lick me in order.

816
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,840
Then next is me.

817
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:38,800
That's right.

818
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,320
Look, look.

819
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,460
He is very happy.

820
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,680
It feels good.

821
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,740
Please lick me too.

822
01:28:47,741 --> 01:28:48,741
He is crying.

823
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,500
He is busy.

824
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,671
There is another one over there.

825
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:10,540
He looks happy.

826
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,260
It's hard to do this, isn't it?

827
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,740
I'm going to use all of this.

828
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,080
Which one do you want to put in?

829
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,500
Which one do you want to put in?

830
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,720
I'm going to put it in.

831
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,360
Do you like this?

832
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:44,620
Did you put in your
underwear? No, it's mine.

833
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,280
It's mine.

834
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:50,100
I wanted to do
it for a long time.

835
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,260
Do it.

836
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:54,820
Which one do you want to put in?

837
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,080
He's hesitating.

838
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
What do you think?

839
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:02,060
Oh, this is good.

840
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:04,180
Put it in.

841
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:05,920
Put it in.

842
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:07,580
Let him lie down.

843
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,900
Oshima-san, lie down.

844
01:30:09,901 --> 01:30:10,620
Spread your legs.

845
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:12,221
You spread your legs and bend your legs.

846
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,700
Good boy.

847
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,880
It's good that you choose the biggest one.

848
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:25,920
Is it OK?

849
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,120
Now, you are going to have a baby.

850
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:34,241
I will put it in your mouth.

851
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,840
Wow! It's so slimy.

852
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,880


853
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,380
I want to put it in your mouth.

854
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,060
I will put it in your mouth.

855
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,660
I want to put it in your mouth.

856
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,160
I want to put it in your mouth.

857
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,460
It feels good.

858
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,740
You like it, don't
you? It feels good.

859
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,000
There are many.

860
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,060


861
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:11,970
I don't know if I can do it with one
hand, but I can't do it with both hands.

862
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,550
This big baby is strong.

863
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:21,170
You're doing a pretty good job.

864
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:22,930
How do you feel? It's the best.

865
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:24,850


866
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:25,950
It's the best? That's good.

867
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,190
It's the best.

868
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,640
Oh, my God.

869
01:31:37,641 --> 01:31:40,440


870
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:42,985
What? Are you going to
give birth soon? Yes, I am.

871
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,040


872
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,200
What? You can't do that yet.

873
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,340
I feel so bad.

874
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,060
You can't do that yet.

875
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,280
You have to give birth
after all the babies are born.

876
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,300
You can't do that.

877
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,220
You have to give birth
after all the babies are born.

878
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:09,700
Oh, I feel good.

879
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,356
It's been a long time since
I've done this, so I was nervous.

880
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,540
Thank you for your hard work.

881
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:18,860
Thank you.

882
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,640
I feel great.

883
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,480
I feel great just by touching her feet.

884
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,300
I feel great.

885
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,540
I'll do the same.

886
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,280
I'll do the same.

887
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:31,281
I'm sorry.

888
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,740
Do you feel good?

889
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,280
Look!

890
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,100
She is in a mess.

891
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:57,420
You are crying, aren't you?

892
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,340
She is in pain because
her legs are entangled.

893
01:33:55,370 --> 01:34:03,850
He moved his two legs and
raised his head to the sky.

894
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:05,670
Oh, he is the most
careful and cuddly of all.

895
01:34:05,895 --> 01:34:08,250
Oh, he is just a baby.

896
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:17,210
He began to shake his hips from there.

897
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,511
He likes the way to
make him shake his hips.

898
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,830
He is the best at shaking his hips.

899
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,190
It's so good.

900
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,150
It's really good.

901
01:35:00,151 --> 01:35:01,151
I'll have one more.

902
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:05,570
I'll have one, too.

903
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:09,380
I can't stop.

904
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's hot.

905
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,641
Oshima-san, let's make a good music video.

906
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,340
Let's welcome him.

907
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:48,341
I'm sorry.

908
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:50,680
Oh, no.

909
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,020
I'm so sorry.

910
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:55,060
You can move around.

911
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,800
We'll move around.

912
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,380
I'll put it here.

913
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,720
I'll put it here.

914
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,040
I'll put it here.

915
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:07,260
I'll put it here.

916
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:08,100
I'll put it here.

917
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:17,320
I'll put it here.

918
01:36:17,321 --> 01:36:18,321
I'm sorry.

919
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:21,731
Look, there is a pacifier next to you.

920
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,280
Look, there is a gap.

921
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:27,260
Look, there is a gap.

922
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:44,120
It's a pacifier.

923
01:36:56,830 --> 01:37:02,230
Look, there is a pacifier next to you.

924
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:03,231
I'm sorry.

925
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:05,311
You want to go home, don't you?

926
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:13,870
Now, hit your back.

927
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,700
It's not over yet.

928
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,960
No!

929
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:51,680
You are amazing.

930
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:52,940
Come on, come on, come on.

931
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,300
Come on.

932
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,160
Come on, come on.

933
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:01,900
You are a man, aren't
you? Yes, you are.

934
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,560


935
01:38:09,370 --> 01:39:06,860
No.1 No.2 No.3 No.

936
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:06,960
4 No.5 No.

937
01:39:06,961 --> 01:39:07,961
6 No.7 No.

938
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:36,460
8 No.

939
01:39:36,461 --> 01:39:37,461
10 Wow!

940
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:42,960
You like this flat bed,
don't you? I like it, too.

941
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,340


942
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,020
Wow!

943
01:39:51,515 --> 01:40:07,700
Manko, you look so happy.

944
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:26,810
Here you are.

945
01:40:29,655 --> 01:40:30,655
I'm glad you like it.

946
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,080
How do you feel? It's the best.

947
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,520


948
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,520
It's the best? That's good.

949
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,120
Let's go deeper.

950
01:40:58,130 --> 01:40:59,130
It feels good.

951
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:00,980
It hurts.

952
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:15,660
It hurts.

953
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:17,780
Do you want more? More.

954
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000


955
01:41:28,755 --> 01:41:33,380
It seems that there are two pussies.

956
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:22,760
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a big one.

957
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:26,940
It's amazing.

958
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:28,701
It's amazing that such
a big one was killed.

959
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:33,900
It's amazing.

960
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:36,100
Are you okay, Oshima-san?

961
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,620
I don't have any strength.

962
01:42:37,621 --> 01:42:38,060
You haven't been home for a while.

963
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,060
I'm so sad.

964
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:41,820
You've been out so much.

965
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,740
I'm so sad.

966
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,040
You've been out so much.

967
01:42:58,265 --> 01:43:07,740
I'm so sad.

968
01:43:07,741 --> 01:43:32,150
I'm so sad.

969
01:43:32,151 --> 01:43:33,930
Don't take a rest, Oshima-san.

970
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:05,420
I'll take care of it.

971
01:44:07,155 --> 01:44:08,740
I'll take care of it.

972
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:10,300
It's the president's turn.

973
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:16,000
It's a different feeling.

974
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:22,460
The president's rolling is amazing.

975
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,960
Don't lick my nipples.

976
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,420
Stop it! I'll do it.

977
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:37,850
I'll do it.

978
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:39,950
I'll do it.

979
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:40,670
I'll do it.

980
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:41,190
I'll do it.

981
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:41,790


982
01:44:42,210 --> 01:44:45,450
I can do it in 3 seconds.

983
01:44:45,451 --> 01:44:45,570
Don't look at me.

984
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:47,290
Don't look at me.

985
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,330
Don't look at me.

986
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:53,470
Don't look at me.

987
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:56,790
Don't look at me.

988
01:44:58,090 --> 01:44:59,090
Don't look at me.

989
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:01,530
Don't look at me.

990
01:45:02,835 --> 01:45:03,835
Don't look at me.

991
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:06,790
Don't look at me.

992
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:09,790
Don't look at me.

993
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:12,590
Don't look at me.

994
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:13,930
Don't look at me.

995
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:14,570
Don't look at me.

996
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:16,230
Who is the fastest?

997
01:45:59,235 --> 01:46:03,820
How do you feel?

998
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,960
I feel great!

999
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:30,620
I feel like I'm going to have a baby.

1000
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:51,840
You feel great all over.

1001
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,780
I'm going to sleep.

1002
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,760
I'm going to sleep.

1003
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:00,620
I'm going to sleep.

1004
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:09,120
You're mumbling.

1005
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:22,320
I'm going to put you in the cage.

1006
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:29,740
You are not allowed to be in the cage.

1007
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:35,080
I'm going to put you in the cage.

1008
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,700
You are not allowed to be in the cage.

1009
01:48:40,701 --> 01:48:41,701
I'll do it.

1010
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,780
I don't want to do it.

1011
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:45,141
Then, take it off by yourself.

1012
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,800
I don't want to do it.

1013
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:56,690
It's comfortable, isn't it?

1014
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:58,090
It's comfortable, isn't it?

1015
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,500
It's comfortable, isn't it?

1016
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,000
It's comfortable, isn't it?

1017
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:30,240
I'll take it off.

1018
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,060
I'll take it off.

1019
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:49,540
President!

1020
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,820
You can feel it in your
stomach, can't you? No, I can't.

1021
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:55,580


1022
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,260
What's that?

1023
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,420
You have a special ability.

1024
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,140
President!

1025
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:11,020
The president made it.

1026
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:12,430
That's our president.

1027
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:13,900
We are also Hideshi.

1028
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:15,300
It's perfect.

1029
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:18,100
Let's go get the cake together.

1030
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:21,560
Please stop doing that.

1031
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:23,920
Stop the inside.

1032
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,160
It's not a problem.

1033
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,240
I can't do it anymore.

1034
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:40,830
It's not good.

1035
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:42,270
I can't do that anymore.

1036
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:44,490
I can't do that anymore.

1037
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:45,950
You are pregnant.

1038
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:47,470
That's right.

1039
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,390
I am so sorry.

1040
01:50:52,490 --> 01:50:53,490
I will do it.

1041
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:55,230
Please don't make a baby sound.

1042
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:59,710
No, please don't.

1043
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:02,110
Please don't.

1044
01:51:02,111 --> 01:51:03,630
I am so sorry.

1045
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:07,770
Please don't.

1046
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:08,790
Please don't.

1047
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,670
Please don't.

1048
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:11,710
Please don't.

1049
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,570
Please don't.

1050
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:18,650
Please don't.

1051
01:51:18,651 --> 01:51:22,270
We are looking for a person
who can give birth to a baby.

1052
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:26,171
Why are you giving birth to such a baby?

1053
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:33,890
I'm going to give birth to a baby.

1054
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,050
I'm going to give birth to a baby, too.

1055
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:38,990
I'm going to give birth to a baby.

1056
01:51:38,991 --> 01:51:43,820
I want to say that it's terrible.

1057
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:45,940
This way.

1058
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,800
Wow.

1059
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,280
What's going on? I'll push you.

1060
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:20,120
I'll put your hand
in your stomach.

1061
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:21,780
Oh, no!

1062
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:29,140
Please, don't!

1063
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,160
Oh, no!

1064
01:52:35,161 --> 01:52:36,360
Don't pull it out.

1065
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,440
I'll pull it out.

1066
01:52:39,441 --> 01:52:40,441
Pull it out.

1067
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,000
Pull it out.

1068
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,341
Put it on the back of the head.

1069
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:44,380
Yes, yes, yes, like this.

1070
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:48,210
OK, look.

1071
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:50,420
One, two, three.

1072
01:52:57,690 --> 01:52:59,080
Did you put out too much?

1073
01:53:05,935 --> 01:53:07,740
Your legs came out, too.

1074
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,000
Wow.

1075
01:53:12,015 --> 01:53:15,240
More, more, more.

1076
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,580
Lift your legs.

1077
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:23,340
Lift your legs more.

1078
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,360
Wow.

1079
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,820
Don't cry.

1080
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:10,640
You are crying a lot.

1081
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,440
You have a beautiful face.

1082
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:28,210
No, I don't.

1083
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:32,130
I don't do that.

1084
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:42,360
You can cry.

1085
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:49,980
More, more.

1086
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:52,120
I was so excited.

1087
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:14,350
I want to poop, too.

1088
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:19,110
Everyone is pooping. Poop more.

1089
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:21,450
Ms. Oshima, do you
want to poop? Yes, I do.

1090
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:24,690
Do you? Yes, I do.

1091
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,630
Please poop more.

1092
01:55:28,030 --> 01:55:29,790
I want to poop a lot.

1093
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:35,140
If you ask me to do so, I
have no choice but to do it.

1094
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:39,740
Here we go.

1095
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:43,420
I can't stop.

1096
01:55:53,150 --> 01:55:54,210
You are amazing.

1097
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:56,370
You are squeezing.

1098
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:00,970
You are amazing.

1099
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:06,560
I'm used to it.

1100
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,720
You are amazing.

1101
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:08,940
I like it so much.

1102
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,680
They are going to be pregnant.

1103
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:24,080
I will be pregnant.

1104
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,200
They will be pregnant.

1105
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,800
I will be pregnant.

1106
01:56:36,370 --> 01:56:40,650
I will be pregnant.

1107
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:56,170
I will be pregnant.

1108
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:58,570
Ah, ah.

1109
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,340
Wow, wow, wow.

1110
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:15,560
OK, let's drink again and meet again later.

1111
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:16,880
Yes, sir.

1112
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:18,580
Today is a meeting of Oshima.

1113
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,440
So, we'll have a drink later.

1114
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:23,420
I'll be back.

1115
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:24,440
I'll be back.

1116
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,720
I was a little lonely.

1117
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:44,080
What are you doing?

1118
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:45,980
This is a good view.

1119
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:47,420
This is a good view.

1120
01:57:47,421 --> 01:57:48,421
This is the first time.

1121
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:50,180
Study hard.

1122
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:51,940
I'll study hard.

1123
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:54,900
OK.

1124
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:57,261
Today is the day to welcome
Mr. Oshima until the morning.

1125
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:05,100
I want to do it next.

1126
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:06,360
I want to do it.

1127
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:20,160
Mr. Oshima, please wait.

1128
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,060
It's a good employee trip.

1129
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:20,010
Everyone, how was the
video full of my personality?

1130
01:59:24,515 --> 01:59:28,039
I can't stand the sight
of my wife spending

1131
01:59:28,051 --> 01:59:31,670
all her money on men
other than her husband.

1132
01:59:38,825 --> 01:59:47,910
By the way, my wife doesn't quit her job.

1133
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:53,810
So, I leave it to your imagination.

1134
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:59,090
What is going on in the company?
