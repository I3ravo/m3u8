1
16.62 --> 39.80
 She's been doing this for a year

2
76.93 --> 81.69
 I'm about to cry

3
103.96 --> 108.96
 It's been a year, but I still feel like I'm not good enough

4
109.96 --> 111.96
 You're not good enough

5
111.96 --> 113.96
 You're being hit

6
114.96 --> 116.96
 I'm not used to it

7
116.96 --> 119.96
 I still don't know how to pose

8
128.48 --> 131.48
 Oh no, it's tomorrow

9
131.48 --> 141.70
 What is self-illumination?

10
141.70 --> 148.22
 It's self-illumination

11
148.22 --> 153.22
 I want to get used to it quickly and be like, oh, I should do that

12
159.11 --> 164.11
 She's the person who can get the best result

13
165.11 --> 169.11
 I've been doing this for a long time, but it's still the same as the first one

14
169.11 --> 174.11
 Actresses gradually become jobs when they do this

15
174.11 --> 222.37
 The day before, I was so nervous that I was about to die

16
223.37 --> 225.37
 Oh no, it's tomorrow

17
225.37 --> 227.37
 I was like, what should I do?

18
237.81 --> 241.81
 The agency always takes a picture of me near the site

19
241.81 --> 260.42
 I brought it so that I could pick it up right away even if I overslept

20
260.42 --> 266.42
 I'm thinking about whether I can do it properly

21
267.42 --> 274.42
 I'm 60% nervous and 40% excited

22
285.88 --> 287.88
 I don't open Twitter at all

23
287.88 --> 290.88
 I didn't like SNS in the first place

24
290.88 --> 294.88
 I finally found out how to use Twitter

25
294.88 --> 296.88
 I'm not good at Twitter

26
296.88 --> 300.88
 It's embarrassing to post selfies

27
307.71 --> 309.71
 Good morning

28
310.71 --> 311.71
 Did you sleep well?

29
311.71 --> 314.71
 No, I didn't sleep at all

30
348.88 --> 349.88
 I'm not used to it

31
349.88 --> 353.88
 I still don't know how to pose

32
353.88 --> 357.88
 I think I should get used to it quickly

33
357.88 --> 359.88
 I'm not used to it

34
360.88 --> 365.88
 I'm not confident in my body

35
365.88 --> 368.88
 I can't show my body

36
374.33 --> 376.33
 I'm still embarrassed

37
393.90 --> 396.90
 I don't want people to think it's normal to take off my clothes

38
397.90 --> 411.99
 I did it!

39
411.99 --> 414.99
 I'm going to eat Kappa-maki

40
415.99 --> 422.25
 I'm going to eat Kappa-maki

41
437.54 --> 438.54
 What's wrong?

42
439.54 --> 441.54
 I'm so nervous

43
450.58 --> 457.58
 It's been a year since I made my debut

44
458.58 --> 460.58
 I'm not used to it at all

45
461.58 --> 464.58
 I don't know how to get used to it

46
464.58 --> 466.58
 I don't know what to do

47
474.57 --> 483.57
 I'm so nervous that I feel like my heart is going to pop out

48
484.57 --> 489.57
 When I made my debut, I could only see the actors

49
489.57 --> 493.57
 But now I can see people around me

50
493.57 --> 497.57
 I feel like they are watching me

51
497.57 --> 513.89
 I'm so nervous

52
647.03 --> 648.03
 It's hot

53
757.27 --> 758.27
 Is it hot?

54
758.27 --> 759.27
 It feels so good

55
939.37 --> 940.37
 I can't do it

56
943.58 --> 944.58
 I can't do it

57
944.58 --> 948.23
 I can't do it

58
949.23 --> 954.55
 I can't do it

59
1291.10 --> 1292.10
 I can't do it

60
1322.77 --> 1323.77
 I can't do it

61
1323.77 --> 1324.77
 I can't do it

62
1631.00 --> 1632.00
 I'm sweating

63
1632.00 --> 1633.00
 Let's leave it there

64
1634.00 --> 1635.00
 It was so erotic

65
1635.00 --> 1636.00
 Really?

66
1636.00 --> 1637.00
 It was so erotic

67
1638.00 --> 1640.00
 I couldn't think of anything

68
1642.00 --> 1644.00
 It felt so good

69
1644.00 --> 1650.00
 I think I like the part where I sweat a lot in a hot room the most

70
1651.00 --> 1658.00
 In a normal shooting, I'm worried about the eyes of the staff

71
1658.00 --> 1663.00
 But it was so hot that I couldn't think of anything

72
1664.00 --> 1667.00
 I was so focused on being erotic

73
1687.38 --> 1689.38
 Do you think this job is suitable for you?

74
1689.38 --> 1690.38
 What do you think?

75
1692.38 --> 1694.38
 I'm not sure

76
1700.38 --> 1702.38
 I'm not sure yet

77
1703.38 --> 1705.38
 Thank you for your hard work

78
1705.38 --> 1707.38
 Thank you

79
1708.38 --> 1761.78
 I feel like I'm shooting forever

80
1768.91 --> 1772.91
 I get so stressed when I shoot

81
1772.91 --> 1777.91
 I feel like I can forget the bad things

82
1784.13 --> 1788.13
 When I was a kid, my dad was into me

83
1788.13 --> 1791.13
 He took me out to eat

84
1791.13 --> 1793.13
 Since then?

85
1794.13 --> 1798.13
 It's been 2 years since I started shooting

86
1802.21 --> 1812.69
 I'm almost alone

87
1813.69 --> 1818.69
 I don't want my friends to ask me about my job

88
1818.69 --> 1820.69
 So I don't meet them

89
1821.69 --> 1826.69
 I don't want to talk about the shooting

90
1827.69 --> 1831.69
 I want to be normal in my private life

91
1847.42 --> 1849.42
 It's still on

92
1871.48 --> 1874.48
 What do you do in an event?

93
1875.48 --> 1880.48
 I just take a picture with my fans

94
1880.48 --> 1883.48
 I'm like, what do you mean?

95
1893.09 --> 1898.09
 You're the one who can show the best of you

96
1899.09 --> 1902.09
 You're not shy anymore

97
1902.09 --> 1904.09
 Am I?

98
1904.09 --> 1909.09
 I want you to keep your shyness

99
1909.09 --> 1940.15
 I want you to be a girl

100
1948.97 --> 1950.97
 I don't know

101
1950.97 --> 1952.97
 I don't know what it is

102
1952.97 --> 1955.97
 I haven't heard about it yet

103
1955.97 --> 1958.97
 I want to do an event with my friends

104
1997.33 --> 2002.33
 I get so stressed when I think about it

105
2002.33 --> 2005.33
 I don't want to think about it

106
2005.33 --> 2008.33
 People care about my rank

107
2009.33 --> 2012.33
 But I don't want to

108
2013.33 --> 2015.33
 I want to get along with everyone

109
2015.33 --> 2018.33
 You used to hate fighting?

110
2018.33 --> 2019.33
 I hate it

111
2019.33 --> 2022.33
 You know, there are a lot of girl groups

112
2022.33 --> 2024.33
 I hate it

113
2024.33 --> 2026.33
 I was alone

114
2027.33 --> 2041.38
 I wanted to get along with everyone

115
2041.38 --> 2043.38
 Can I go in?

116
2043.38 --> 2045.38
 Can I?

117
2045.38 --> 2047.38
 I'll check

118
2048.38 --> 2050.38
 Please wait

119
2073.10 --> 2076.10
 This is for golf practice

120
2080.10 --> 2083.10
 This is really hard

121
2083.10 --> 2086.10
 I've never been in this level

122
2086.10 --> 2098.25
 It's embarrassing

123
2105.23 --> 2108.23
 I got this from Aika

124
2108.23 --> 2110.23
 It was when I debuted

125
2110.23 --> 2115.23
 I want to think of you as the person I like

126
2115.23 --> 2120.23
 Then I can show the best of me

127
2120.23 --> 2123.23
 That's what I think

128
2123.23 --> 2125.23
 I'm trying

129
2125.23 --> 2127.23
 I'm really intense

130
2127.23 --> 2129.23
 When I think I like someone

131
2129.23 --> 2133.23
 I can show that I like that person

132
2133.23 --> 2137.23
 Do you do that with a fat man?

133
2137.23 --> 2139.23
 No, it doesn't matter

134
2139.23 --> 2143.23
 If I don't, I get more nervous

135
2143.23 --> 2146.23
 I can't do anything

136
2146.23 --> 2150.23
 I do it in my private time

137
2150.23 --> 2152.23
 I see

138
2159.41 --> 2164.41
 I want to be able to work in a music video

139
2187.65 --> 2191.65
 I'm different from myself

140
2191.65 --> 2195.65
 I don't know who I am yet

141
2195.65 --> 2198.65
 Do you like it?

142
2198.65 --> 2200.65
 I like it

143
2200.65 --> 2201.65
 I like it

144
2201.65 --> 2204.65
 I want to do my best

145
2205.65 --> 2209.65
 Don't be so nervous

146
2209.65 --> 2212.65
 That's what I want to say

147
2212.65 --> 2218.37
 There are a lot of people when we shoot

148
2218.37 --> 2221.37
 It's embarrassing

149
2232.58 --> 2235.58
 It's coming

150
2235.58 --> 2237.58
 Wait

151
2237.58 --> 2240.58
 Wait, I'm laughing

152
2241.58 --> 2244.95
 Yes

153
2245.95 --> 2247.95
 I'm going out

154
2247.95 --> 2249.95
 I want you to be alone

155
2249.95 --> 2264.46
 Long time no see

156
2264.46 --> 2266.46
 Can I come in?

157
2266.46 --> 2267.46
 Yes

158
2267.46 --> 2269.46
 Thank you

159
2277.78 --> 2279.78
 I'm nervous

160
2280.78 --> 2284.78
 Can you do this?

161
2286.78 --> 2288.78
 Can you call me when you're done?

162
2288.78 --> 2297.98
 Yes

163
2297.98 --> 2299.98
 He's gone

164
2299.98 --> 2302.98
 I'm nervous

165
2302.98 --> 2305.98
 I'm nervous, too

166
2305.98 --> 2307.98
 I'm nervous, too

167
2307.98 --> 2308.98
 You're lying

168
2308.98 --> 2309.98
 I'm serious

169
2309.98 --> 2314.57
 It's quiet

170
2314.57 --> 2316.57
 It's quiet

171
2320.57 --> 2322.57
 It's quiet

172
2322.57 --> 2324.57
 It's quiet

173
2324.57 --> 2326.57
 It's quiet

174
2326.57 --> 2327.57
 It's good

175
2327.57 --> 2328.57
 Yes

176
2333.57 --> 2334.57
 It's quiet

177
2334.57 --> 2336.57
 Yes

178
2338.57 --> 2340.57
 It's clean

179
2340.57 --> 2341.57
 Yes

180
2341.57 --> 2342.57
 Yes

181
2346.57 --> 2347.57
 I'm sorry

182
2347.57 --> 2348.57
 I don't want to do this

183
2351.57 --> 2356.46
 Is it okay to turn off the camera?

184
2356.46 --> 2358.46
 It's so dark

185
2358.46 --> 2360.46
 It's dark

186
2360.46 --> 2361.46
 It's dark

187
2361.46 --> 2363.46
 How dark can it be?

188
2363.46 --> 2365.46
 Turn it off

189
2366.46 --> 2368.46
 Oh, it's dark

190
2370.46 --> 2373.46
 Should I turn it off and turn it on?

191
2373.46 --> 2375.46
 Yes

192
2375.46 --> 2379.86
 It's dark

193
2379.86 --> 2381.86
 It's dark.

194
2381.86 --> 2383.86
 I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

195
2384.86 --> 2386.86
 Isn't it too dark?

196
2386.86 --> 2389.86
 It's brighter than usual.

197
2389.86 --> 2393.86
 But the situation is different.

198
2393.86 --> 2394.86
 The situation?

199
2394.86 --> 2396.86
 The situation is different.

200
2397.86 --> 2399.86
 Are you filming?

201
2399.86 --> 2401.86
 Are you filming?

202
2407.51 --> 2408.51
 I'm sorry.

203
2408.51 --> 2410.51
 Why are you apologizing?

204
2410.51 --> 2412.51
 I'm nervous.

205
2412.51 --> 2414.51
 Come here.

206
2415.51 --> 2418.51
 I don't know why, but I'm nervous.

207
2422.04 --> 2424.04
 You're late.

208
2426.67 --> 2428.67
 How long has it been?

209
2428.67 --> 2430.67
 It's been a long time.

210
2430.67 --> 2431.67
 It's been a long time.

211
2431.67 --> 2435.67
 It's been a long time since I made my debut.

212
2436.67 --> 2438.67
 It's been more than half a year.

213
2440.67 --> 2442.67
 It's been a long time.

214
2444.67 --> 2445.67
 Are you used to it?

215
2445.67 --> 2447.67
 I'm used to it.

216
2450.67 --> 2452.67
 I'm nervous.

217
2453.67 --> 2454.67
 Are you nervous?

218
2454.67 --> 2455.67
 Yes.

219
2455.67 --> 2456.67
 Why are you nervous?

220
2456.67 --> 2458.67
 Why am I nervous?

221
2458.67 --> 2460.67
 I don't know why.

222
2469.67 --> 2471.67
 I'm sorry.

223
2476.16 --> 2478.16
 How do I do it?

224
2478.16 --> 2480.16
 How do you do it?

225
2483.16 --> 2484.16
 How do you do it?

226
2484.16 --> 2486.16
 How do I do it?

227
2496.90 --> 2498.90
 I'm embarrassed.

228
2503.04 --> 2506.86
 Let's start with French.

229
2532.62 --> 2534.62
 You're very soft.

230
2535.62 --> 2537.62
 Right?

231
2544.43 --> 2554.72
 Let's have fun.

232
2555.72 --> 2556.72
 We're alone.

233
2556.72 --> 2557.72
 That's right.

234
2557.72 --> 2558.72
 Right?

235
2558.72 --> 2559.72
 That's right.

236
2559.72 --> 2560.72
 You're a pervert.

237
2560.72 --> 2562.72
 I'm not a pervert.

238
2563.72 --> 2564.72
 I'm not a pervert.

239
2564.72 --> 2565.72
 You're a pervert.

240
2566.72 --> 2568.72
 As far as I remember, you're a pervert.

241
2569.72 --> 2572.72
 I'll forget that.

242
2572.72 --> 2573.72
 Really?

243
2573.72 --> 2574.72
 Yes.

244
2574.72 --> 2575.72
 Really?

245
2575.72 --> 2576.72
 Yes.

246
2576.72 --> 2577.72
 Really?

247
2577.72 --> 2578.72
 Yes.

248
2578.72 --> 2596.52
 Really?

249
2596.52 --> 2597.52
 Yes.

250
2597.52 --> 2602.26
 I'm embarrassed.

251
2602.26 --> 2603.26
 I'll do my best.

252
2603.26 --> 2605.96
 Hello.

253
2605.96 --> 2606.96
 Hello.

254
2630.97 --> 2631.97
 Hello.

255
2631.97 --> 2636.18
 It's very black.

256
2636.18 --> 2638.18
 It's getting whiter.

257
2638.18 --> 2639.18
 I see.

258
2650.88 --> 2654.88
 Is it like this when you take a picture of your teeth?

259
2654.88 --> 2655.88
 It's amazing.

260
2657.88 --> 2659.88
 It's like this.

261
2688.81 --> 2689.81
 Show me your teeth.

262
2701.90 --> 2702.90
 You have thin breasts.

263
2708.90 --> 2709.90
 Why are you hiding it?

264
2717.64 --> 2718.64
 You're cute.

265
2752.50 --> 2753.50
 Is it good?

266
2753.50 --> 2754.50
 Yes.

267
2777.78 --> 2778.78
 Your clothes are getting dirty.

268
2778.78 --> 2779.78
 Do you want to take it off?

269
2780.78 --> 2781.78
 I'll take it off for you.

270
2785.38 --> 2786.38
 No.

271
2786.38 --> 2787.38
 You don't need it?

272
2788.38 --> 2789.38
 I don't need it.

273
2789.38 --> 2790.38
 You don't need it?

274
2790.38 --> 2791.38
 Yes.

275
2791.38 --> 2792.38
 I'll take it off.

276
2793.38 --> 2794.38
 I'll take it off.

277
2801.50 --> 2802.50
 You're hiding it.

278
2803.50 --> 2832.89
 You stand up right away.

279
2835.89 --> 2836.89
 You stand up right away.

280
2871.18 --> 2872.18
 Are you embarrassed?

281
2872.18 --> 2873.18
 Just a little.

282
2873.18 --> 2874.18
 Just a little?

283
2874.18 --> 2875.18
 Yes.

284
2875.18 --> 2876.18
 Just a little?

285
2879.18 --> 2880.18
 I'm not embarrassed.

286
2880.18 --> 2881.18
 You're not embarrassed?

287
2881.18 --> 2882.18
 No.

288
2883.18 --> 2886.58
 I'm not embarrassed.

289
2904.34 --> 2905.34
 Does it feel good?

290
2905.34 --> 2906.34
 Yes.

291
2948.38 --> 2949.38
 Look at me.

292
2954.38 --> 2955.38
 Open your eyes.

293
2958.69 --> 2960.69
 There's a lot of stuff in my pocket.

294
2960.69 --> 2961.69
 There's a key in your pocket.

295
2967.96 --> 2968.96
 You're kind.

296
2968.96 --> 2969.96
 It's okay.

297
2970.96 --> 2971.96
 There's something in my pocket.

298
2985.87 --> 2998.36
 It feels good.

299
3005.70 --> 3006.70
 You're good at licking.

300
3008.70 --> 3009.70
 Really.

301
3009.70 --> 3010.70
 Really.

302
3060.01 --> 3061.01
 I'm nervous.

303
3064.01 --> 3067.02
 What's going on?

304
3067.02 --> 3068.02
 There's a hole.

305
3068.02 --> 3069.02
 There's a hole.

306
3070.02 --> 3071.02
 It's fashionable.

307
3071.02 --> 3072.02
 I've never seen it before.

308
3072.02 --> 3073.02
 I've never seen it before.

309
3076.02 --> 3077.02
 It's amazing.

310
3078.02 --> 3080.02
 I can see a lot here.

311
3081.02 --> 3082.02
 What's this?

312
3082.02 --> 3083.02
 The back of the blood vessel.

313
3084.02 --> 3085.02
 This is...

314
3085.02 --> 3086.02
 Can you see it?

315
3086.02 --> 3088.66
 Yes.

316
3089.66 --> 3090.66
 You know how to touch it.

317
3091.66 --> 3093.66
 I'm tracing the blood vessel.

318
3097.66 --> 3098.66
 I'm nervous.

319
3099.66 --> 3102.42
 Please.

320
3103.42 --> 3104.42
 Please.

321
3115.65 --> 3116.65
 It's big.

322
3119.65 --> 3120.65
 It's too big.

323
3121.65 --> 3122.65
 That's not true.

324
3128.34 --> 3131.30
 It feels good, doesn't it?

325
3144.13 --> 3145.13
 Can I lick it?

326
3145.13 --> 3146.13
 Yes.

327
3156.46 --> 3157.46
 I like your eyes.

328
3158.46 --> 3159.46
 My eyes?

329
3177.62 --> 3178.62
 It feels good.

330
3218.26 --> 3219.26
 I'm embarrassed.

331
3219.26 --> 3220.26
 Are you embarrassed?

332
3266.83 --> 3267.83
 I'm embarrassed.

333
3279.58 --> 3280.58
 I'll lick your nipples.

334
3280.58 --> 3281.58
 Can I?

335
3282.58 --> 3312.67
 I'll lick your nipples.

336
3354.02 --> 3361.65
 It hurts.

337
3377.18 --> 3378.18
 It feels good.

338
3396.18 --> 3397.18
 It feels good.

339
3397.18 --> 3398.18
 This?

340
3401.18 --> 3402.18
 It hurts.

341
3426.89 --> 3427.89
 What should I do?

342
3430.89 --> 3441.78
 It feels good.

343
3442.78 --> 3443.78
 What?

344
3445.78 --> 3446.78
 What?

345
3448.78 --> 3475.60
 Does it feel good?

346
3477.60 --> 3478.60
 It feels good.

347
3480.60 --> 3498.50
 I'm going to get it dirty.

348
3508.34 --> 3509.34
 It feels good.

349
3521.24 --> 3522.24
 It's very wet.

350
3523.24 --> 3524.24
 Really?

351
3525.24 --> 3535.49
 It feels good.

352
3535.49 --> 3536.49
 It feels good.

353
3598.97 --> 3599.97
 Do you like this?

354
3599.97 --> 3600.97
 Yes.

355
3601.97 --> 3607.10
 It feels good.

356
3632.43 --> 3641.08
 I'm embarrassed.

357
3654.26 --> 3655.26
 I don't care.

358
3680.42 --> 3681.42
 I'm embarrassed.

359
3681.42 --> 3682.42
 Are you embarrassed?

360
3682.42 --> 3683.42
 Yes.

361
3684.42 --> 3685.42
 I'm embarrassed.

362
3686.42 --> 3687.42
 I'll lick your nipples.

363
3765.13 --> 3766.13
 It feels good.

364
3812.06 --> 3813.06
 It's bright.

365
3814.06 --> 3815.06
 Why did you put on makeup?

366
3816.06 --> 3817.06
 I didn't put on makeup.

367
3823.51 --> 3830.11
 What should I do?

368
3831.11 --> 3832.11
 I'm dizzy.

369
3832.11 --> 3833.11
 Are you dizzy?

370
3836.38 --> 3837.38
 I'm sorry.

371
3895.21 --> 3896.21

374
3937.00 --> 3951.79
 It feels good.

375
3977.54 --> 3979.54
 Did you forget to eat?

376
3979.54 --> 3980.54
 Did you forget to eat?

377
3980.54 --> 3981.54
 Yes.

378
4025.96 --> 4030.58
 I can't do it anymore.

379
4053.03 --> 4054.03
 Can I do it?

380
4054.03 --> 4055.03
 No.

381
4055.03 --> 4056.03
 Can I do it?

382
4056.03 --> 4057.03
 No.

383
4157.11 --> 4158.11
 It's hot.

384
4167.28 --> 4168.28
 Why did you do that?

385

 It's hot.

386
4257.71 --> 4260.66
 It's hot.

387
4266.66 --> 4267.66
 Do you want to change your clothes?

388
4315.29 --> 4316.29
 You're trembling.

389
4329.22 --> 4332.22
 Your legs are entangled in the futon.

390
4347.58 --> 4348.58
 It's hot.

391
4361.48 --> 4362.48
 It's very hot.

392
4393.89 --> 4394.89
 It's very hot.

393
4395.89 --> 4416.48
 It feels good just to see you.

394
4416.48 --> 4417.48
 I'm tired.

395
4478.12 --> 4479.12
 You're trembling.

396
4491.74 --> 4492.74
 It's hot.

397
4524.42 --> 4525.42
 It feels good.

398
4532.74 --> 4533.74
 Put your hands on your back.

399
4540.00 --> 4541.00
 Put your hands on the desk.

400
4541.00 --> 4542.00
 No.

401
4544.00 --> 4545.00

 Can you see me?

404
4600.30 --> 4601.30
 I can see you.

405
4610.69 --> 4611.69
 It feels good.

406
4645.21 --> 4651.34
 Put your hands on your back.

407
4654.34 --> 4655.34
 You're cute.

408
4670.32 --> 4671.32
 It's hot.

409
4671.32 --> 4672.32
 Is it hot?

410
4673.32 --> 4674.32
 Isn't it hot?

411
4675.32 --> 4676.32
 It feels good.

412
4703.91 --> 4707.82
 Can I take a picture of you?

413
4707.82 --> 4708.82
 Yes, you can.

414
4779.74 --> 4780.74
 I'm sleepy.

415
4810.64 --> 4815.26
 I'm sleepy.

416
4817.26 --> 4824.43
 I'm sleepy.

417
4899.42 --> 4900.42
 How do you feel?

418
4951.11 --> 4953.87
 Turn around.

419
4965.42 --> 4984.30
 It feels good.

420
5046.46 --> 5047.46
 It feels good.

421
5051.46 --> 5052.46
 It feels good.

422
5176.41 --> 5177.41
 What's wrong?

423
5177.41 --> 5178.41
 I'm embarrassed.

424
5178.41 --> 5179.41
 Are you embarrassed to be seen?

425
5187.86 --> 5188.86
 It feels good, doesn't it?

426
5188.86 --> 5196.99
 It feels good.

427
5241.17 --> 5242.17
 It feels good.

428
5426.02 --> 5427.02
 I'm embarrassed.

429
5427.02 --> 5428.02
 I'm embarrassed.

430
5429.02 --> 5432.74
 It feels good.

431
5432.74 --> 5433.74
 Did you feel good?

432
5436.74 --> 5437.74
 I'm sweating.

433
5440.74 --> 5441.74
 It feels good.

434
5452.99 --> 5453.99
 I'm sweating.

435
5469.81 --> 5470.81
 It was dangerous.

436
5470.81 --> 5471.81
 It was dangerous.

437
5471.81 --> 5473.81
 Can you wipe my sweat?

438
5476.31 --> 5477.31
 You didn't have to wipe my sweat.

439
5479.31 --> 5480.31
 I didn't have to do that.

440
5484.33 --> 5485.33
 Can I take a picture of you?

441
5485.33 --> 5486.33
 Yes, you can.

442
5486.33 --> 5489.22
 Thank you.

443
5492.22 --> 5495.49
 It feels good.

444
5496.49 --> 5498.49
 It was the most comfortable.

445
5502.99 --> 5503.99
 I'm tired.

446
5503.99 --> 5504.99
 I want to go to bed.

447
5504.99 --> 5505.99
 I want to go to bed.

448
5548.92 --> 5551.92
 I'd like to fill up three bags today.

449
5551.92 --> 5552.92
 I'm happy.

450
5574.50 --> 5578.50
 At first, when I was in high school, I didn't join a club.

451
5578.50 --> 5582.50
 At first, my teacher told me to join a club.

452
5582.50 --> 5585.50
 So, I joined a club.

453
5585.50 --> 5588.50
 But, it was more and more fun than I thought.

454
5588.50 --> 5590.50
 It was refreshing.

455
5591.50 --> 5594.50
 So, I continued to join a club.

456
5595.50 --> 5597.50
 I may be self-satisfied.

457
5597.50 --> 5601.50
 I feel like I've become beautiful.

458
5634.08 --> 5637.08
 I live alone.

459
5638.08 --> 5640.08
 I drink tea alone.

460
5640.08 --> 5642.08
 I eat rice alone.

461
5643.08 --> 5644.08
 Here you are.

462
5645.08 --> 5646.08
 Thank you.

463
5659.06 --> 5662.06
 I can't come here alone.

464
5662.06 --> 5665.06
 But, you brought me here.

465
5666.06 --> 5668.06
 I'll bring you here anytime.

466
5668.06 --> 5669.06
 Thank you.

467
5670.06 --> 5674.06
 Thank you for coming here.

468
5675.06 --> 5678.06
 I've never seen such a good volunteer.

469
5678.06 --> 5680.06
 You're the best.

470
5680.06 --> 5681.06
 I'm about to cry.

471
5682.06 --> 5683.06
 I'm about to cry.

472
5686.06 --> 5688.06
 Why am I about to cry?

473
5691.06 --> 5692.06
 Thank you.

474
5694.06 --> 5695.06
 Why am I about to cry?

475
5696.06 --> 5697.06
 Why am I about to cry?

476
5698.06 --> 5701.06
 I'm a grandmother.

477
5701.06 --> 5705.06
 I'm healed by my grandmother.

478
5712.49 --> 5718.49
 When I was in high school, I wanted to go to a nursing school.

479
5718.49 --> 5721.49
 But, I gave up going to a university.

480
5723.49 --> 5727.49
 I'm grateful that I can do this now.

481
5727.49 --> 5731.49
 Do you want to be a nurse after you retire?

482
5731.49 --> 5732.49
 Yes, I do.

483
5732.49 --> 5735.49
 I'm thinking about my qualification.

484
5736.49 --> 5738.49
 It's embarrassing to talk about this.

485
5746.62 --> 5749.62
 When I was a child, I lived with my grandmother.

486
5749.62 --> 5753.62
 I called her mother.

487
5753.62 --> 5755.62
 My mother was my mother.

488
5755.62 --> 5758.62
 I called her mother.

489
5759.62 --> 5761.62
 I was like this.

490
5762.62 --> 5764.62
 I was with my grandmother all the time.

491
5784.22 --> 5785.22
 Oh, my God.

492
5795.53 --> 5796.53
 I've arrived.

493
5806.02 --> 5808.02
 That's where I used to live.

494
5808.02 --> 5811.02
 I feel like the paint is new.

495
5820.06 --> 5825.06
 My parents got married and moved to Tochigi.

496
5825.06 --> 5842.50
 We used to hang out here together.

497
5843.50 --> 5854.83
 At school, there is a 1 in 2 adult ceremony.

498
5854.83 --> 5862.83
 When I was 10 years old, I had a presentation in front of everyone.

499
5863.83 --> 5865.83
 I wrote that I was an actress.

500
5865.83 --> 5870.83
 I wrote that I would be an actress 10 years later and work hard every day.

501
5870.83 --> 5872.83
 I thought I was an actress.

502
5875.83 --> 5876.83
 I was surprised.

503
5877.83 --> 5882.83
 When I was in elementary school, I wanted to be a celebrity.

504
5882.83 --> 5886.83
 I wanted to be a model or an idol.

505
5886.83 --> 5889.83
 I was kidding.

506
5890.83 --> 5892.83
 I became an actress.

507
5898.17 --> 5900.17
 This is the place.

508
5922.23 --> 5923.23
 Do you want to go to a love hotel?

509
5924.23 --> 5925.23
 I don't go to a love hotel.

510
5925.23 --> 5929.23
 When I was a teenager, I went to a love hotel.

511
5929.23 --> 5930.23
 I haven't been to a love hotel since then.

512
5930.23 --> 5931.23
 You haven't been to a love hotel, have you?

513
5939.62 --> 5941.62
 It's very beautiful.

514
5941.62 --> 5943.62
 I didn't think it would be like this.

515
5957.38 --> 5964.38
 I was so nervous that I may not remember.

516
5964.38 --> 5968.38
 I don't remember how I did it.

517
5968.38 --> 5969.38
 I'm blank.

518
5976.46 --> 5981.46
 I'm curious about the seniors.

519
5981.46 --> 5984.46
 I'm curious about how they do it.

520
6047.75 --> 6048.75
 It's close.

521
6055.79 --> 6056.79
 I was surprised.

522
6060.79 --> 6061.79
 It was a ping-pong table.

523
6078.67 --> 6079.67
 No one is here.

524
6081.67 --> 6082.67
 Good morning.

525
6082.67 --> 6084.67
 Thank you for your hard work.

526
6093.82 --> 6094.82
 I'm sweating.

527
6094.82 --> 6095.82
 I was surprised.

528
6382.06 --> 6387.64
 I'm sorry.

529
6513.10 --> 6520.85
 I was surprised.

530
6520.85 --> 6523.22
 I'm sorry.

531
6597.51 --> 6631.25
 I'm sorry.

532
6634.58 --> 6702.62
 I'm sorry.

533
6708.19 --> 6709.19
 I'm sorry.

534
6711.19 --> 6712.19
 I'm sorry.

535
6733.19 --> 6734.19
 I'm sorry.

536
6899.21 --> 6918.80
 I'm sorry.
