1
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
I'm back.

2
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,720
What did you come to do today?

3
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,710
Today?

4
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,870
What did I come to do?

5
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,710
I think I came to have sex.

6
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,830
What do you mean by sex?

7
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,790
Is it okay to have a normal sex?

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
No.

9
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,420
I want you to take it off.

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
What?

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm going to take it off.

12
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,040
Can I take it off normally?

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,340
No.

14
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,941
You called me because you
had a purpose, didn't you?

15
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,310
Well... Normally...

16
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,950
I don't want to take it off normally.

17
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,080
It's not normal.

18
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,650
It's not normal, Echi.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,990
What is not normal, Echi?

20
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:00,991
What does that mean?

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,250
I want to be messed up.

22
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
Why are you blushing?

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,380
You want to be messed up?

24
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,381
Do you want to be loved?

25
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,160
You don't like normal love?

26
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:05,160
I want to say a lot of
different words than usual.

27
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,610
Can't you do something unusual?

28
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,990
You have a lot of boyfriends, don't you?

29
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,310
People think I'm a pervert.

30
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,130
Can't I say that?

31
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,010
Are you okay with an old man this old?

32
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,990
I think I can do a lot of things.

33
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:03,991
I see.

34
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,711
What were you thinking when you came here?

35
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,700
Well...

36
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,740
Were you imagining a lot of erotic things?

37
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,830
Well... Well...

38
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,050
I don't think so.

39
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,240
I don't know what to do with myself.

40
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't know what to do with myself.

41
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:25,620
I don't know what to do with myself.

42
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:25,800
I don't know what to do with myself.

43
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
I don't know what to do with myself.

44
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,120
I don't know what to do with myself.

45
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm sorry.

46
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,020
I don't know why, but I can't
help but cry when I think about it.

47
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:10,621
I don't know why, but I can't
help but cry when I think about it.

48
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:26,870
I'm so happy to see you.

49
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,150
I'm so happy to see you.

50
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:39,690
I'm so happy to see you.

51
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,660
You look funny.

52
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:59,460
Have you ever had a hair cut?

53
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm sure you have.

54
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,680
I'll take a video of you.

55
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:11,681
Do it like you always do.

56
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,460
Like a woman.

57
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Turn to the other side.

58
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,530
Show me your left side.

59
00:21:19,780 --> 00:22:34,380
I'm sorry.

60
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:44,670
What's this?

61
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,190
You dropped it.

62
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:10,790
Did you get a shock?

63
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,390
Are you okay with just your fingers?

64
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,110
What are you touching?

65
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,110
I want this.

66
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,110
I want to put it in my mouth.

67
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,350
Can you make it bigger?

68
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,810
Look this way.

69
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
I'm filming you.

70
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,560
I wanted to eat it so badly

71
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:56,150
I wanted to eat it so
badly You kept eating it.

72
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,560
You can eat up to the point
where you want me to feed you.

73
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:16,180
What are you staring at?

74
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,940
Is it bad, Chinko?

75
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,760
It's delicious.

76
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,220
I want you to give me more.

77
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:31,541
I want you to give me more bread.

78
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:17,510
Give me more.

79
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:45,090
It's strange, isn't it? You can do it more.

80
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,370
Do it as usual.

81
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,500
It's almost there.

82
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,760
You can't eat it, can you?

83
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Stand up.

84
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,650
You have to keep it in your mouth.

85
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,250
You'll spit it out soon.

86
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,090
I'm sorry.

87
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:26,091
I'll keep it.

88
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,210
Thank you.

89
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:14,788

00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,960
Baby, when are you going to grow up?

92
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
I don't know.

93
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,270
I'm sure that you'll grow up well if
you get to know more about the world.

94
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:56,410
I hope that you'll stay active more.

95
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,971
You'll know better that you'll
notice new things as time passes.

96
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,046
Today's video was about a video

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:24,500
You are about to jump.

119
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Are you excited?

120
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,280
Are you very excited?

It's hot.

123
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
It feels good, doesn't it?

124
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,560
It feels good.

125
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,940
What should I do with this?

00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Well...

I don't want you to show your face.

129
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:24,901
I'm going to finish it today.

00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,240
I'm going to finish it.

131
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
What?

132
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,120
I'm going to finish it.

133
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,540
I don't want to do it.

134
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,480
I want you to hug me.

135
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,310
The baby is crying.

136
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,850
I want to hold her.

137
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,890
I want to hold her.

138
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:18,340
Does it feel different?

How are you feeling?

143
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,441
Put on something comfortable for you.

144
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,450
There?

145
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,840
Don't step on my waist.

146
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,460
Put it on yourself.

147
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
There?

148
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,680

00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:17,160
Can you do that?

154
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,180
She is so cute.

155
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:31,100
I can't do it anymore.

156
00:51:33,360 --> 00:52:06,270
I can't do it anymore.

157
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,470
I can't do it anymore.

158
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,080

I'm sorry.

162
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:48,970
I'm tired.

163
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,270
I'm going to put a blanket on you.

164
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,450
I'm going to take a bath now.

165
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:02,451
I'm going to take a bath.

166
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:14,420
Can I drink it?

167
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,360
Do you want to drink it all at once?

168
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
What does it taste like?

169
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,390
It's a strange taste.

170
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,810
A strange taste?

171
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,530
It's a mixed taste.

172
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,290
What is mixed?

173
00:55:53,720 --> 00:56:05,090
The juice in me and the juice in you.

174
00:56:05,091 --> 00:56:06,691
Do you want to know what it smells like?

175
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,391
Do you want to know what it smells like?

176
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,901
It smells like something mixed.

177
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,910
Is it mixed?

178
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,950
You look happy.

179
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,350
Are you satisfied?

180
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:27,351
Are you going to sleep?

181
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,910
It's hot.

182
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,590
Are you done?

183
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,010
What's that face?

184
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:55,776
You can't take it anymore, can you?

185
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,110
Hide your eyes.

186
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,270
Hide your eyes.

187
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:26,290
Can you see?

188
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,480
I can't see.

189
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,930
Maybe this side is lower.

190
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,030
Like this.

191
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:46,070
Can you see?

192
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:48,950
I can't see.

193
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,210
Let's play a little more.

194
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,241
You can't see it, but it's fun, isn't it?

195
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,920
This is a fun game.

196
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,450
When you cover your eyes,
your sensitivity will increase, right?

197
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:39,290
Let's go to the vet.

198
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,710
Sorry to keep you waiting.

199
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,960
You don't need a rubber band today, right?

200
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,780
No, she is fine.

201
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:12,441
She is a baby She is grumbling
You are doing a good job.

202
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,190
Do you want to be massaged?

203
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:25,851
Yes, I want to be massaged.

204
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,611
You can use as much as you want.

205
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,800
It's very sweet.

206
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:45,610
I want to give you a massage.

207
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:50,430
Please give me a massage.

208
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,430
I'm sorry.

209
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,240
It's a bit cold.

210
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:47,050
You're sweating a lot.

211
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,300
You're sweating a lot.

212
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,900
I want you to get used to it.

213
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,060
I can't do it anymore.

214
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,980
You don't have to worry about it.

215
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:25,800
Don't do it on your own.

216
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,800
I like this sound.

217
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,520
It sounds good.

218
01:04:45,405 --> 01:04:47,900
More, more...

219
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,920
You are tightening it well.

220
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:55,930
Tighten it more.

221
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
I'm sorry.

222
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,160
Are you ready?

223
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Are you okay?

224
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,280
Are you okay?

225
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,500
You really wanted to drink, didn't you?

226
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
I'm sorry.

227
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,400
Don't go without permission.

228
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,000
You haven't gone yet, have you?

229
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,001
Don't go.

230
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,890
What are you trying to do now?

231
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,810
Don't be selfish.

232
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,320
What?

233
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,020
Don't let go.

234
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:25,080
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

235
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,620
Oh!

236
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,300
Oh!

237
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,520
Oh!

238
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,220
What?

239
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:52,130
What?

240
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,350
Please help me again.

241
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:56,350
No, no, no, I won't.

242
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,070
Ah!

243
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,580
I'm glad you are happy.

244
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:15,901
I know you want to go to the vet.

245
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,980
I'm glad you are happy.

246
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:16,981
I'm glad you are happy.

247
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,450
You don't like it at all.

248
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,030
I'm scared.

249
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,290
You don't like it at all.

250
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,950
I'm scared.

251
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:29,750
I'm scared.

252
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,271
I told you not to touch it.

253
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,560
I'm scared.

254
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,940
I'll wash your body.

255
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:55,480
You don't like it at all.

256
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:14,800
I was able to wash her face clean.

257
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:28,240
At that time, I thought that she was going
to the bathroom, but I did not notice it.

258
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:29,120
I washed her body clean
and put her on the floor.

259
01:14:29,121 --> 01:14:35,660
I was surprised that she didn't move.

260
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,066
I'm going to wash my
daughter's face with hot

261
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:55,170
water, but I can't do
it because it's too hot.

262
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:57,137
I'm going to wash my
daughter's face with hot

263
01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:59,170
water, but I can't do
it because it's too hot.

264
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:02,060
I'm going to wash my
daughter's face with hot

265
01:15:02,072 --> 01:15:04,910
water, but I can't do
it because it's too hot.

266
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:07,298
I'm going to wash my
daughter's face with hot

267
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:09,171
water, but I can't do
it because it's too hot.

268
01:15:26,030 --> 01:16:01,459
I'm going to wash my
daughter's face with hot

269
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:37,700
water, but I can't do
it because it's too hot.

270
01:17:24,960 --> 01:18:35,480
In the meantime, in the next video...

271
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:46,376
I will show you the part
where I will slip on the floor.

272
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,721
In the next video, I will show you the part
where I will get wet in the next video.

273
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,361
Why did you make it so clean?

274
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:13,370
Why did you make it smell so bad?

275
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,470
There's more over there.

276
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,350
I'll clean it up.

277
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,710
I'll clean it up.

278
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:36,550
Give me a kiss.

279
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,820
Don't lick my hand.

280
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,260
I feel good.

281
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,820
Don't lick my hand.

282
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:58,810
You can lick my feet, Fubuki.

283
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,490
You can lick my feet.

284
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:47,650
You can lick my fingers, Fubuki.

285
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,440
I can't do it.

286
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:36,450
You can do it if you're a
little more concentrated.

287
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,160
I can't do it.

288
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,690
I can't do it.

289
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:10,290
I can't do it I can't
do it I can't do it.

290
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:13,710
I can't do it.

291
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,210
I can't do it.

292
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,090
Look, lick my finger properly.

293
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:31,370
Use your tongue.

294
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:34,030
Lick between my fingers.

295
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:58,830
I can't do it.

296
01:23:58,831 --> 01:23:59,030
You lick me.

297
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,970
I can't do it.

298
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,480
What are you doing?

299
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,060
What are you doing?

300
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,840
I can't do it.

301
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,720
I told you to lick it cleanly, didn't I?

302
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,350
You can't eat it now.

303
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
I can't eat it.

304
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,880
Lick it cleanly.

305
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,630
You have to lick it well.

306
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,060
You want to go to the bathroom?

307
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,560
You want to go to the bathroom?

308
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,330
What are you talking about when
you were just about to be eaten?

309
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:49,310
You said you wanted to be eaten, but you're
the one who wants to be eaten, right?

310
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:52,110
Eat it all the way to the end.

311
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,810
I wanted to put it in your mouth.

312
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,730
Eat it all the way.

313
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,830
It's hard, isn't it?

314
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:26,030
Open your mouth.

315
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,680
You can do it!

316
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,520
You can do it!

317
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,920
You can do it!

318
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,140
The day has come.

319
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,470
He seems to be in a good mood.

320
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,750
Good boy.

321
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,010
Do you feel so good?

322
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,250
Good boy.

323
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,610
I don't want to do it.

324
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,260
I'm going to spread your legs.

325
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:38,190
You're annoying.

326
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:49,440
I'm going to spread your legs.

327
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,960
I don't want to do it.

328
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,240
I can't do it anymore.

329
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,120
I can't do it anymore.

330
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,801
Do you want me to call the doctor?

331
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,400
I can't do it at all.

332
01:31:21,705 --> 01:31:22,640
I can't do it at all.

333
01:31:22,641 --> 01:31:23,641
I'm fine.

334
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,900
What's wrong?

335
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:45,180
I think you're a little dirty.

336
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,600
I think you're a little dirty.

337
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:52,060
Do you want a new diaper?

338
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,620
I don't want it at all.

339
01:32:55,621 --> 01:32:57,440
Please, dad.

340
01:32:59,135 --> 01:33:06,230
I'm gonna open your legs.

341
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,740
What's this?

342
01:33:37,741 --> 01:33:38,741
Give me your hand.

343
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:00,560
Don't lie down.

344
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,000
You can't move at all.

345
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:16,880
Don't cry.

346
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:18,150
I'm sorry.

347
01:36:18,151 --> 01:36:19,151
I'm so happy.

348
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,100
It means that he is about to give birth.

349
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,760
He seems to have a lot of problems.

350
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:28,900
The baby is crying.

351
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,900
What do you want?

352
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,420
What do you want?

353
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:49,840
Please give me something to drink.

354
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,640
Where do you want me to put it?

355
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,520
Where do you want it?

356
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,900
Put it in my stomach.

357
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:47,820
You can do it.

358
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:49,620
Spread your legs.

359
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:57,210
Can you do it?

360
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,770
Yes, I can.

361
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:09,020
I'm sorry.

362
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,441
You don't have time to rest.

363
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,040
Good boy.

364
01:43:50,110 --> 01:45:05,550
I'm so sorry, I'm such a bad boy.

365
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,250
I'm sorry I don't know
how to be a good boy.

366
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:20,000
You didn't know how to be a good boy.

367
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:22,140
You don't know how to be a good boy.

368
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:22,180
You don't know how to be a good boy.

369
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:32,800
Mama, you love playing
with your neck, don't you?

370
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:43,390
You're amazing.

371
01:45:44,490 --> 01:46:40,640
You love playing with your neck, don't you?

372
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:55,880
It feels good.

373
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:59,120
What's in there?

374
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,440
Mama, it's Chin-chin.

375
01:47:04,441 --> 01:47:06,620
Why are you whining?

376
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,040
Who are you?

377
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,080
I don't know.

378
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:14,520
I don't know.

379
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,300
You don't know?

380
01:47:16,490 --> 01:47:19,940
You don't know that I'm whining?

381
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:39,560
You don't know that I'm whining?

382
01:47:39,561 --> 01:47:40,561
You are dead.

383
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,240
Who do you want to be?

384
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:53,111
Who do you want to be if you are alive?

385
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,540
No, I don't want to be anyone.

386
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:59,060
You don't want to be anyone, do you?

387
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,151
You don't want to be anyone, do you?

388
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,800
You are dead.

389
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:45,060
It's time to take a bath.

390
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:39,120
You've got a lot of bubbles.

391
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:40,161
You have a lot of bubbles.

392
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:45,331
I'm going to give you a new one.

393
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:48,380
I'm going to get rid of all the bubbles.

394
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,300
What's wrong?

395
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:46,810
What do you want?

396
01:50:49,130 --> 01:50:50,130
I'm sorry.

397
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:52,550
You don't know me.

398
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:53,850
Do you want a seat?

399
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:56,440
Are you OK?

400
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,700
I'm sorry.

401
01:52:10,215 --> 01:52:11,500
I'm sorry.

402
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:56,840
It's so hot.

403
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:58,940
It's so hot.

404
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:12,650
It's so hot.

405
01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:14,410
I'm going to take a shower.

406
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:24,390
Do you understand?

407
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:27,390
It's foaming.

408
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:28,690
It's foaming.

409
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:32,770
It's like cream.

410
01:53:32,771 --> 01:53:33,771
It looks like a flower.

411
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:37,430
What does it smell like?

412
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:49,830
It smells like a flower has bloomed.

413
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:52,570
It doesn't smell.

414
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,850
Let me taste it.

415
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:57,310
It's sour.

416
01:53:58,710 --> 01:53:59,970
Is it the taste of sage?

417
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:04,290
It tastes like sage.

418
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:07,670
Is it the taste of sage?

419
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,551
I wonder if it's good. It's mixed
too much, so it's a different taste.

420
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:17,351
It's already out, so push it in properly.

421
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:26,290
I put it in.

422
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:38,140
I went to the shower.

423
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:48,440
How was it?

424
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:57,080
Did you enjoy it?

425
01:54:57,081 --> 01:54:58,081
Are you happy now?

426
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:01,470
I'm happy.

427
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:03,970
Are you happy now?

428
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:06,590
As you wish?

429
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:08,810
Yes.

430
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,561
Don't you want to be happier?

431
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:19,040
Do you still have more?

432
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:22,070
Do you still have more?

433
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:27,820
I want to be happier.

434
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:37,460
Then, follow me.

435
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:28,450
You look good in it.

436
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:32,350
I don't want to.

437
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,440
I'm hungry.

438
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:26,700
Put your hand on it.

439
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,460
Turn around.

440
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,880
You don't like it.

441
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,280
Why?

442
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,260
Let's add more people.

443
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:50,240
I want to add more people.

444
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,800
I want to add more people.

445
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:53,680
Okay.

446
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,041
I'll call a lot of people.

447
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:58,660
How many people?

448
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,980
I don't know.

449
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:01,360
How many people do you want?

450
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:02,740
How many people do you want?

451
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:06,320
How many children do you have?

452
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,320
Five?

453
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:11,500
Six.

454
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:12,780
That's a lot.

455
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:19,021
Well, it's good to have a lot.

456
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,400
Greed.

457
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,720
Greed.

458
02:00:23,721 --> 02:00:24,721
Greed.

459
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:31,960
It's greed.

460
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,981
You have to prepare for it.

461
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:51,951
Do you know what preparation is?

462
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:01,560
You have to stretch.

463
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:05,781
A lot of things are coming.

464
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:13,336
You want me to use the
bungee cord, don't you?

465
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:14,360
Yes.

466
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:17,891
Then, you have to loosen the bungee cord.

467
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:20,540
I can't.

468
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:22,880
You can't?

469
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,180
Then, let's do it.

470
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:46,470
You look great.

471
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:54,970
Can you move?

472
02:03:03,490 --> 02:03:04,330
You can't move.

473
02:03:04,331 --> 02:03:05,331
You don't like it?

474
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:23,880
Ok, let me massage your belly.

475
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:21,916
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

476
02:04:21,928 --> 02:04:34,730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

477
02:05:16,330 --> 02:05:18,610
I'm going to take a nap.

478
02:05:18,611 --> 02:05:19,611
I'm going to take a nap.

479
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:24,870
I'm going to take a nap.

480
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:25,510
I'm going to take a nap.

481
02:05:25,511 --> 02:05:26,511
I'm going to take a nap.

482
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:28,350
I'm going to take a nap.

483
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:29,790
I'm going to take a nap.

484
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:31,180
I'm going to take a nap.

485
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:33,270
I'm going to take a nap.

486
02:07:47,010 --> 02:08:21,110
He is pulling the string.

487
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:39,790
His tail is moving on its own.

488
02:08:55,110 --> 02:09:57,400
Do you understand?

489
02:09:57,930 --> 02:10:19,720
He is moving on its own.

490
02:10:19,721 --> 02:10:21,740
What?

491
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:23,540
I'm sick.

492
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:33,920
Say it.

493
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:36,280
I'm sick.

494
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:07,940
I'm sick.

495
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:55,780
Why?

496
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:56,000
It's hot.

497
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:41,120
It's going to come out.

498
02:23:21,330 --> 02:23:25,110
I'm sure you feel a tingling
sensation in your stomach.

499
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:52,670
Say, switch on.

500
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:59,640
I can't hear you.

501
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:02,700
Switch on.

502
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:06,880
Louder.

503
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:07,680
He's turning around.

504
02:27:22,010 --> 02:30:05,560
Were you sleeping?

505
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:09,160
Yes, I was.

506
02:30:10,090 --> 02:30:11,260
Did he come?

507
02:30:11,261 --> 02:30:12,720
Did the man come?

508
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:14,700
Yes, he did.

509
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:16,480
Did he come?

510
02:30:17,380 --> 02:30:18,560
He woke up.

511
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:32,540
What's wrong?

512
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:33,820
Why are you so happy?

513
02:30:33,821 --> 02:30:34,821
Why did you call me?

514
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:38,020
Because I was waiting for you.

515
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:39,460
I see.

516
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,000
You haven't finished your exercise.

517
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:42,500
It's perfect, isn't it?

518
02:30:44,380 --> 02:30:45,000
It's perfect.

519
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:47,200
Can I call a man?

520
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:51,580
I won't stand up.

521
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:54,560
I'll greet you here.

522
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:04,020
Come in.

523
02:31:15,330 --> 02:31:16,510
You look great.

524
02:31:16,511 --> 02:31:17,511
You're so cool.

525
02:31:19,090 --> 02:31:20,090
What are you doing?

526
02:31:20,330 --> 02:31:22,890
You're showing your boobs.

527
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:26,490
What do you want to do?

528
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:33,410
This?

529
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:38,350
This?

530
02:31:40,990 --> 02:31:41,990
What's wrong?

531
02:31:44,490 --> 02:31:45,610
I want you to put it in.

532
02:31:52,990 --> 02:31:54,310
Do you want me to do it properly?

533
02:31:57,150 --> 02:31:58,270
I want you to put it inside.

534
02:31:59,690 --> 02:32:00,690
Inside?

535
02:32:02,610 --> 02:32:03,610
What do you mean by that?

536
02:32:04,450 --> 02:32:11,600
You want me to put it inside?

537
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:16,900
I want you to put it inside.

538
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:24,100
If you do it well,

539
02:32:26,260 --> 02:32:27,700
I'll put it inside.

540
02:32:27,701 --> 02:32:31,180
But you're three, so
I'll let you stay here.

541
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:33,300
I'll get you in there for you.

542
02:32:36,680 --> 02:33:00,860
I can't get in there.

543
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:04,680
You can't get in there.

544
02:33:10,850 --> 02:33:28,370
It's still there.

545
02:33:29,390 --> 02:33:30,170
It's still in there.

546
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:31,730
I thought you were in a bad mood.

547
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:33,350
You can't get in there.

548
02:33:33,351 --> 02:33:37,430
Don't put it in your mouth.

549
02:33:45,600 --> 02:35:06,980
I want to put it in my mouth.

550
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:10,580
You can't put it in your mouth yet.

551
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,360
It's not a mouth.

552
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:16,720
You put it in your mouth.

553
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:32,700
I'm sorry.

554
02:35:32,701 --> 02:35:33,701
You have a lot of hair.

555
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:36,600
I have a lot of hair on this side, too.

556
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:24,890
You have a lot of hair.

557
02:36:24,891 --> 02:36:25,971
I wonder if it's delicious.

558
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:34,930
It's getting delicious.

559
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:08,530
Have a good sleep!

560
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:10,930
Wǒ!

561
02:37:11,330 --> 02:37:12,330
Wǒ!

562
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:13,890
Wǒ!

563
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:16,290
Wǒ!

564
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:16,810
Wǒ!

565
02:37:17,330 --> 02:37:18,330
Er!

566
02:37:20,610 --> 02:37:22,170
Wǒ!

567
02:37:24,590 --> 02:37:25,590
Wǒ!

568
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:26,910
Wǒ!

569
02:37:40,410 --> 02:37:51,840
It's good, isn't it?

570
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:03,500
I can't do it anymore.

571
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:59,640
I'm done.

572
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:03,980
Nnn!.

573
02:39:03,981 --> 02:39:04,981
Nn-!!

574
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:10,220
Nn-!!

575
02:39:10,221 --> 02:39:10,260
Nnn-!!

576
02:39:10,261 --> 02:39:11,261
Nnn-!!

577
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:22,860
It's already over?

578
02:39:24,380 --> 02:39:25,380
Nnn-!!

579
02:39:27,490 --> 02:39:29,170
You don't look like you're in a good mood.

580
02:39:55,400 --> 02:40:12,848
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

581
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:30,320
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

582
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:11,160
What's wrong?

583
02:41:15,750 --> 02:41:23,740
What's wrong?

584
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:37,230
What's wrong?

585
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:06,410
Ouch!

586
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:14,000
Ouch!

587
02:42:19,210 --> 02:42:20,210
Manko?

588
02:42:20,410 --> 02:42:21,410
You're in there.

589
02:42:21,950 --> 02:42:22,950
What are you saying?

590
02:42:26,055 --> 02:42:27,055
It's Manko Kuchi.

591
02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:32,490
I'm glad you're in there.

592
02:42:33,530 --> 02:42:34,530
You're in the way.

593
02:42:34,890 --> 02:42:35,890
There's more, right?

594
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:14,158
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

595
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:30,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

596
02:43:43,985 --> 02:43:57,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

597
02:43:57,423 --> 02:44:10,860
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:16,340
You are big, aren't you?

599
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:17,760
I want you to eat more.

600
02:44:42,570 --> 02:45:30,300
This is the end of today's video!

601
02:45:30,450 --> 02:45:46,853
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

602
02:45:46,865 --> 02:46:03,280
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

603
02:46:40,050 --> 02:46:41,050
It's so hot.

604
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:22,660
The baby is in pain.

605
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:27,160
I was surprised.

606
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:30,420
I was surprised.

607
02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:32,460
I'm sorry.

608
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:39,280
I'm sorry.

609
02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:40,280
I'm sorry.

610
02:47:40,281 --> 02:47:40,500
I'm sorry.

611
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:41,640
I'm sorry.

612
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:43,160
I'm sorry.

613
02:48:39,770 --> 02:48:41,270
It's okay.

614
02:48:41,271 --> 02:48:42,271
It's okay.

615
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:46,010
It's okay.

616
02:48:46,470 --> 02:48:47,470
It's okay.

617
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:09,700
Prank!

618
02:50:14,390 --> 02:50:24,010
I'm going to eat it all.

619
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:50,360
It's painful, isn't it?

620
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:53,920
I put it in your belly, didn't I?

621
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:58,940
Why do you put it in
your belly with your hand?

622
02:51:02,370 --> 02:51:03,380
Tie it up.

623
02:51:44,470 --> 02:51:47,330
I can't do it anymore.

624
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:52,910
I can't do it anymore.

625
02:52:19,260 --> 02:52:20,260
Let me go!

626
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:08,240
He is in a good mood.

627
02:54:31,440 --> 02:54:33,440
How do you feel?

628
02:54:36,220 --> 02:54:37,220
How do you feel?

629
02:54:42,250 --> 02:54:43,250
Tell me.

630
02:54:46,780 --> 02:54:50,320
You wanted to be licked, didn't you?

631
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:56,740
You are being licked.

632
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:02,460
It's hot.

633
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:34,140
I'm gonna throw up.

634
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:36,940
I'm gonna throw up.

635
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:02,870
Don't spit it out.

636
02:56:02,910 --> 02:56:04,270
Show me the water in your mouth.

637
02:56:05,790 --> 02:56:08,750
Show me the water in your mouth.

638
02:56:11,070 --> 02:56:12,710
Don't spit it out.

639
02:56:19,060 --> 02:56:22,740
Is there any water left in your mouth?

640
02:56:22,741 --> 02:56:23,200
Do you still have some in your mouth?

641
02:56:23,201 --> 02:56:24,201
Do you want to drink?

642
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:26,600
Do you want to drink?

643
02:56:26,601 --> 02:56:27,681
Do you want to drink water?

644
02:57:29,990 --> 02:57:30,990
You have a wide mouth.

645
02:57:31,490 --> 02:57:32,570
Now you can eat everything.

646
02:57:50,020 --> 02:57:51,020
What's wrong with you?

647
02:57:51,220 --> 02:57:52,220
What's wrong with you?

648
02:57:58,610 --> 02:58:00,980
Don't overdo it.

Ahhhhh.

661
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:13,980
She is having a mental breakdown.

662
03:02:47,100 --> 03:02:49,240
Is it good?

663
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:51,980
Is it good?

664
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:55,840
It's bitter.

665
03:02:56,130 --> 03:02:57,130
What? Is it bitter?

666
03:02:58,740 --> 03:03:00,140
It's bitter.

667
03:03:00,540 --> 03:03:01,540
It's bitter.

668
03:03:02,040 --> 03:03:03,040
Do you want more?

669
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:04,500
Yes.

670
03:03:10,550 --> 03:03:11,550

Oh!!

673
03:03:31,070 --> 03:03:31,940
Ah!

674
03:03:31,941 --> 03:03:32,941
Urgh!

675
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:34,300
Oh!

676
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:38,440
Oh!

677
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:41,820
Oh!

678
03:03:41,821 --> 03:03:42,821
Oh!

679
03:03:44,620 --> 03:03:45,920
Look over here.

680
03:03:47,470 --> 03:04:00,020
Look at his face, he has a big one
in his mouth Let me see your face.

681
03:04:17,380 --> 03:04:18,800
What's wrong with you?

682
03:04:18,801 --> 03:04:23,380
Come on, give it back, it's a waste.

683
03:04:28,970 --> 03:04:31,090
I'm going to give you this
big one for the last time.

684
03:04:32,390 --> 03:04:34,560
Take it with your belly. Can you do it?

685
03:05:16,400 --> 03:05:19,946
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

686
03:05:19,958 --> 03:05:23,500
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

687
03:05:23,501 --> 03:05:24,501
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I'm hungry, I'm hungry.

688
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:10,740
Show me your mouth.

689
03:06:15,140 --> 03:06:19,740
You can't do it because
you have a weak body.

690
03:06:31,560 --> 03:06:32,960
You have a scar.

691
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:36,760
It's coming out.

692
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:37,920
Clean it up.

693
03:06:57,800 --> 03:07:00,060
I don't know why I'm doing this.

694
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:44,860
He is still a baby.

695
03:08:39,085 --> 03:08:41,480
He is in a bad mood.

696
03:08:41,600 --> 03:08:42,600
He is still a baby.

697
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:45,260
I miss him.

698
03:08:45,261 --> 03:08:46,261
I don't want to.

699
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:52,600
I'm glad.

700
03:08:53,580 --> 03:08:54,860
I'm glad you put it in the bowl.

701
03:08:59,140 --> 03:09:00,140
I don't want to.

702
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:08,760
You have to say it.

703
03:09:11,070 --> 03:09:12,070
Give me the bowl.

704
03:09:12,920 --> 03:09:14,520
If you don't say it, he won't put it in.

705
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:34,340
Good evening.

706
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:42,040
No, no, no, no.

707
03:09:42,041 --> 03:09:43,041
Why?

708
03:09:43,140 --> 03:09:44,140
Why?

709
03:09:45,700 --> 03:09:46,700
Look.

710
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:50,420
You are eating too much.

711
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:54,400
I ate all.

712
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:54,960
What?

713
03:09:55,360 --> 03:09:56,540
You ate all.

714
03:09:57,680 --> 03:09:58,680
You are enjoying today.

715
03:10:00,140 --> 03:10:01,680
You are a cute cosplayer.

716
03:10:03,100 --> 03:10:04,320
It suits you.

717
03:10:05,460 --> 03:10:06,460
It suits me.

718
03:10:07,010 --> 03:10:07,980
What's this?

719
03:10:07,981 --> 03:10:08,700
Is this a bra?

720
03:10:08,860 --> 03:10:09,860
It's a bra.

721
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:11,120
Is it?

722
03:10:11,310 --> 03:10:12,040
Yes, it is.

723
03:10:12,180 --> 03:10:14,376
There's a pocket here, so I
don't know what's in there.

724
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:15,400
What?

725
03:10:15,440 --> 03:10:16,440
It's not a bra.

726
03:10:16,860 --> 03:10:17,180
It's a bra?

727
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:19,296
It looks like it's going
to hurt your chest.

728
03:10:19,320 --> 03:10:21,320
Yeah, it looks like it's
going to hurt your chest.

729
03:10:21,820 --> 03:10:22,820
How big is it?

730
03:10:23,280 --> 03:10:23,560
It's big.

731
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:24,460
It's small.

732
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:25,200
It's small.

733
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:27,280
Everyone is caught up in this cosplay.

734
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:28,840
Yeah.

735
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:30,600
You're wearing weird pants.

736
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,740
Is this how you usually dress?

737
03:10:36,700 --> 03:10:38,100
How do you usually do it?

738
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:39,980
Usually?

739
03:10:42,920 --> 03:10:48,780
When I'm at home, I
don't put it on my tongue.

740
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:51,800
I don't put it on my brain.

741
03:10:52,500 --> 03:10:53,220
Brain?

742
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:53,560
Brain bread?

743
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:54,800
Brain bread.

744
03:10:55,130 --> 03:10:56,130
It's a strange word.

745
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:59,000
Let me hear it.

746
03:10:59,001 --> 03:11:00,001
What do you want to do?

747
03:11:02,680 --> 03:11:04,621
Ferris wheel Ferris wheel?

748
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:07,320
In the Ferris wheel?

749
03:11:07,321 --> 03:11:09,780
In the Ferris wheel And?

750
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:12,220
Where?

751
03:11:14,700 --> 03:11:15,700
Where?

752
03:11:17,500 --> 03:11:18,500
Everything.

753
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,000
Everything?

754
03:11:20,220 --> 03:11:20,760
Do you want to do everything?

755
03:11:21,020 --> 03:11:22,180
Do you want to do everything?

756
03:11:22,380 --> 03:11:28,660
You don't have much time It's
only about 10 minutes, isn't it?

757
03:11:28,700 --> 03:11:29,800
But you still did it.

758
03:11:32,100 --> 03:11:33,120
I stopped at the top.

759
03:11:36,700 --> 03:11:40,800
It's the top, so I can't see it
because the side is a little down.

760
03:11:42,910 --> 03:11:45,030
You were in a situation
where you wanted me to do it.

761
03:11:45,520 --> 03:11:46,520
Yes.

762
03:11:47,710 --> 03:11:49,070
Where is the thing that comes out?

763
03:11:49,700 --> 03:11:50,700
I hid it.

764
03:11:52,805 --> 03:11:55,820
At that time, I didn't have
tissues, so I had to use my mouth.

765
03:11:56,580 --> 03:11:57,620
You had to use your mouth.

766
03:11:58,455 --> 03:12:00,400
So that's how you made the mistake.

767
03:12:01,340 --> 03:12:03,220
Is there any place other
than the Ferris wheel?

768
03:12:04,420 --> 03:12:07,880
Other than the Ferris wheel...

769
03:12:09,980 --> 03:12:12,320
There's nothing but school.

770
03:12:13,320 --> 03:12:14,396
There's nothing but school?

771
03:12:14,420 --> 03:12:15,860
You're making a mistake in Japanese.

772
03:12:18,520 --> 03:12:19,520
Stairs?

773
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:20,600
Stairs.

774
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:23,000
The top floor.

775
03:12:23,075 --> 03:12:24,160
The top floor is not used.

776
03:12:25,830 --> 03:12:26,940
This is the top floor.

777
03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:28,640
You like the top floor.

778
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:30,340
You like the top floor.

779
03:12:31,220 --> 03:12:32,220
You like the top floor.

780
03:12:34,540 --> 03:12:36,640
That's right.

781
03:12:37,750 --> 03:12:39,380
If you go to the top floor,

782
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:40,640
you will want to do it.

783
03:12:41,800 --> 03:12:43,060
I will be free.

784
03:12:44,220 --> 03:12:45,860
It's not the top floor now.

785
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:48,320
It's not the top floor now.

786
03:12:48,321 --> 03:12:49,321
You don't want to do it?

787
03:12:50,980 --> 03:12:51,980
No.

788
03:12:53,125 --> 03:12:55,360
You don't want to do it?

789
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:56,440
No.

790
03:12:56,441 --> 03:12:59,380
I'm not the top, but I'm a little worried.

791
03:13:01,430 --> 03:13:04,540
You're the only one.

792
03:13:05,910 --> 03:13:08,040
I'm always worried about the side.

793
03:13:15,220 --> 03:13:18,300
I'm always worried about the side.

794
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:19,840
What do you want to do?

795
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:23,680
I want to be with a lot of people.

796
03:13:24,320 --> 03:13:26,080
What do you want to
do with a lot of people?

797
03:13:29,350 --> 03:13:32,700
I want to get along with them.

798
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:38,400
So I want to ask them for help.

799
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:40,920
So you want to stay here.

800
03:13:42,260 --> 03:13:43,140
That's good.

801
03:13:43,141 --> 03:13:49,760
How many do you have? 4 or 5?

802
03:13:52,830 --> 03:13:54,280
As many as I can.

803
03:13:55,340 --> 03:13:56,340
As many as you can?

804
03:13:56,990 --> 03:13:58,590
Don't worry, everyone is getting better.

805
03:14:04,180 --> 03:14:05,760
Look at this.

806
03:14:05,910 --> 03:14:07,420
I'm going to give you a peck.

807
03:14:10,670 --> 03:14:12,880
You're getting better.

808
03:14:15,020 --> 03:14:21,340
Let's have everyone out.

809
03:14:24,630 --> 03:14:28,960
Nana, how are you?

810
03:14:30,860 --> 03:14:33,140
I called you a lot today.

811
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:36,760
I have a lot.

812
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:38,860
You did your best.

813
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:41,100
It's a reward.

814
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:45,460
How many boys do you have?

815
03:14:49,560 --> 03:14:50,560
Four.

816
03:14:51,900 --> 03:14:53,040
I have one.

817
03:14:54,680 --> 03:14:55,680
That's good.

818
03:15:00,170 --> 03:15:01,650
Do you want to lick it?

819
03:15:01,651 --> 03:15:04,890
Do you want to lick it?

820
03:15:05,070 --> 03:15:05,410
Do you want to lick it?

821
03:15:05,630 --> 03:15:06,630
OK.

822
03:15:07,450 --> 03:15:09,650
Look at this.

823
03:15:26,150 --> 03:15:27,460
If you lick it a lot,

824
03:15:27,720 --> 03:15:28,720
it will get better.

825
03:15:30,300 --> 03:15:31,460
What are you going to do?

826
03:15:31,980 --> 03:15:33,380
Do you want to put it on the table?

827
03:15:33,420 --> 03:15:34,680
You want to put it in your mouth?

828
03:15:34,681 --> 03:15:35,756
I want to put it in my mouth.

829
03:15:35,780 --> 03:15:36,856
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

830
03:15:36,880 --> 03:15:37,260
You want to put it in your mouth?

831
03:15:37,780 --> 03:15:39,840
It's too early.

832
03:15:40,880 --> 03:15:41,880
I have it.

833
03:15:43,320 --> 03:15:45,200
You were happy when I put it in your mouth.

834
03:15:49,690 --> 03:15:50,680
I have it.

835
03:15:50,681 --> 03:15:51,681
You have a lot of it.

836
03:15:54,400 --> 03:15:55,400
You have it.

837
03:16:02,840 --> 03:16:03,980
You are good at it.

838
03:16:05,400 --> 03:16:07,640
You are comparing the taste.

839
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:12,910
Everything is good.

840
03:16:18,490 --> 03:16:20,380
Which one do you like more?

841
03:16:21,140 --> 03:16:22,320
Which one?

842
03:16:27,370 --> 03:16:31,980
You have a good face.

843
03:16:32,420 --> 03:16:34,020
Hold this for a moment.

844
03:16:36,800 --> 03:16:38,620
No, I don't want it.

845
03:16:38,621 --> 03:16:39,140
You don't want it?

846
03:16:39,590 --> 03:16:41,990
Be careful, be careful, be careful.

847
03:16:45,140 --> 03:16:48,200
I'll put it in front of your eyes.

848
03:16:49,400 --> 03:16:54,920
Do you want it?

849
03:16:58,420 --> 03:16:59,420
I don't want it.

850
03:17:06,750 --> 03:17:07,890
I'm going to give it a try.

851
03:17:07,891 --> 03:17:08,891
Are you tasting it?

852
03:17:09,230 --> 03:17:10,730
I have to taste it.

853
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:12,190
It's raw.

854
03:17:17,090 --> 03:17:20,170
It's very slimy.

855
03:17:25,665 --> 03:17:27,630
Do you know it's raw?

856
03:17:30,970 --> 03:17:31,970
I'm scared.

857
03:17:35,150 --> 03:17:35,330
I'm scared.

858
03:17:35,930 --> 03:17:36,930
I'm scared.

859
03:17:45,660 --> 03:17:47,786
You can't be so serious
because you're still tasting it.

860
03:17:47,810 --> 03:17:48,810
You can't be so serious.

861
03:17:49,310 --> 03:17:50,630
Do you want to taste another one?

862
03:17:50,990 --> 03:17:51,990
Yes.

863
03:17:55,980 --> 03:17:57,550
It's a taste.

864
03:17:57,850 --> 03:17:58,850
It's a taste.

865
03:18:08,370 --> 03:18:10,530
I want to taste this one too.

866
03:18:12,230 --> 03:18:13,230
How is it?

867
03:18:14,090 --> 03:18:15,250
It's good.

868
03:18:15,670 --> 03:18:15,830
What?

869
03:18:16,270 --> 03:18:17,670
It's good.

870
03:18:18,110 --> 03:18:18,410
It's good.

871
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:20,010
Let's go to the next one.

872
03:18:21,850 --> 03:18:22,890
This one is good too.

873
03:18:23,770 --> 03:18:24,510
Let's go.

874
03:18:24,790 --> 03:18:25,790
Next.

875
03:18:34,080 --> 03:18:35,390
It feels good.

876
03:18:42,050 --> 03:18:45,350
It's not Ajin's face, but
isn't it really Ajin's face?

877
03:18:50,050 --> 03:18:51,050
One more.

878
03:19:02,550 --> 03:19:04,790
It's amazing that Ajin's legs are so open.

879
03:19:10,450 --> 03:19:11,450
It hurts.

880
03:19:13,130 --> 03:19:14,250
You are being turned around.

881
03:19:16,375 --> 03:19:17,830
I wanted to be turned around.

882
03:19:19,020 --> 03:19:21,410
As you can see, everyone is
doing the same thing to you.

883
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:34,540
Don't do that.

884
03:19:35,155 --> 03:19:36,155
You shouldn't do that.

885
03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:37,560
You are Ajimi.

886
03:19:40,220 --> 03:19:42,260
I'm just giving you a drink.

887
03:19:43,810 --> 03:19:45,740
Everyone is in such a small room.

888
03:19:45,741 --> 03:19:46,936
There are so many kids in the room.

889
03:19:46,960 --> 03:19:47,960
It's so small.

890
03:19:54,480 --> 03:19:55,520
I know.

891
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:57,440
Let's go to the other side.

892
03:19:58,500 --> 03:20:00,340
You should wear
blindfolds at the same time.

893
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:01,440
OK.

894
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:03,440
Wait a minute.

895
03:20:04,180 --> 03:20:05,180
I can't see.

896
03:20:05,610 --> 03:20:06,690
Let's go to the large room.

897
03:20:06,960 --> 03:20:07,960
Sit down.

898
03:20:08,960 --> 03:20:10,440
Everyone wears the hands of the head.

899
03:20:11,310 --> 03:20:12,710
You can wear the hands of the head.

900
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:17,200
It's dangerous.

901
03:20:24,520 --> 03:20:25,520
Do you want to go inside?

902
03:20:26,350 --> 03:20:28,440
Do you want to go in slowly?

903
03:20:29,140 --> 03:20:31,240
Yes, slowly.

904
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:35,100
Push him out.

905
03:20:35,280 --> 03:20:36,340
Push him out.

906
03:20:36,341 --> 03:20:37,680
Let's sit here.

907
03:20:37,681 --> 03:20:44,700
What's inside?

908
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:50,560
Which one was the first one?

909
03:20:51,400 --> 03:20:52,640
Do you know?

910
03:20:54,900 --> 03:20:56,940
The first one.

911
03:20:57,380 --> 03:20:57,720
Oh, you know.

912
03:20:58,100 --> 03:20:59,560
Let's sit here.

913
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:01,480
Where?

914
03:21:01,481 --> 03:21:02,481
Where is it?

915
03:21:04,760 --> 03:21:06,640
You can sit on this
bed if you don't like it.

916
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:08,420
I can't see it.

917
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:14,040
It's okay. You can't see it
because you cover your eyes.

918
03:21:15,800 --> 03:21:17,340
Your sensitivity will increase, right?

919
03:21:23,280 --> 03:21:24,460
He likes to be petted.

920
03:21:32,510 --> 03:21:33,870
You have very wide legs.

921
03:22:00,180 --> 03:22:01,180
How do you feel?

922
03:22:01,920 --> 03:22:02,720
Do you feel good?

923
03:22:02,721 --> 03:22:04,700
You wanted to poop a lot, didn't you?

924
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:10,350
How do you feel?

925
03:22:10,500 --> 03:22:22,320
You don't have to hold your pee?

926
03:22:30,165 --> 03:22:31,165
It's like...

927
03:22:31,700 --> 03:22:32,700
What's wrong?

928
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:35,561
Everyone... You're
doing your best.

929
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:43,080
It's like...

930
03:22:43,230 --> 03:22:44,380
What's wrong?

931
03:22:44,980 --> 03:22:46,920
I feel like there are a lot of dogs.

932
03:22:47,090 --> 03:22:52,681
It's like... It's like... It's
like... I don't want to do it.

933
03:22:57,480 --> 03:22:58,680
How is it? Are you having fun?

934
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:00,500
I'm having fun.

935
03:23:02,420 --> 03:23:05,540
I'm having more fun than before.

936
03:23:06,200 --> 03:23:07,200
You're doing your best.

937
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:08,920
No, I'm not.

938
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:13,340
I'm going to lick your butt.

939
03:23:13,341 --> 03:23:14,341
I'm going to lick you.

940
03:23:20,100 --> 03:23:21,420
Where do you want me to lick you?

941
03:23:24,480 --> 03:23:25,480
Where?

942
03:23:29,840 --> 03:23:31,260
I want you to lick where I say.

943
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:32,800
I'm going to lick you.

944
03:23:32,801 --> 03:23:33,801
Let's go.

945
03:23:40,370 --> 03:23:41,420
Be careful.

946
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:45,440
Please lick me gently.

947
03:23:52,455 --> 03:23:56,220
Four boys are licking you.

948
03:23:58,290 --> 03:23:59,290
What's wrong?

949
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:04,620
What's wrong?

950
03:24:05,810 --> 03:24:06,860
Please lick my necklace.

951
03:24:08,920 --> 03:24:10,280
Everyone is licking your necklace.

952
03:24:17,670 --> 03:24:20,870
I feel like my hands are full.

953
03:24:21,890 --> 03:24:22,890
What?

954
03:24:23,390 --> 03:24:25,270
I feel like my hands are full.

955
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:27,570
Let me see.

956
03:24:28,930 --> 03:24:31,870
Let me take your blindfold off.

957
03:24:38,230 --> 03:24:41,190
He's sleeping.

958
03:24:46,120 --> 03:24:47,120
I was surprised.

959
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:51,450
It's better to have a lot of babies.

960
03:24:52,270 --> 03:24:55,650
I was surprised because
I had too many babies.

961
03:24:55,651 --> 03:24:56,790
Kizu, are you surprised?

962
03:25:01,530 --> 03:25:03,730
I think some of you are
meeting him for the first time.

963
03:25:04,790 --> 03:25:05,790
Come here.

964
03:25:08,490 --> 03:25:10,190
You have to say hello to everyone.

965
03:25:11,190 --> 03:25:12,190
You have to say hello.

966
03:25:17,610 --> 03:25:18,750
What's your name?

967
03:25:21,830 --> 03:25:23,070
My name is Nana.

968
03:25:23,071 --> 03:25:24,071
This is my mom.

969
03:25:24,630 --> 03:25:25,690
She is so cute.

970
03:25:26,910 --> 03:25:27,910
She is so cute.

971
03:25:30,130 --> 03:25:31,790
What did you come here to eat today?

972
03:25:36,170 --> 03:25:40,990
I came here because I wanted to eat a lot.

973
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:46,030
What do you want to eat?

974
03:25:46,250 --> 03:25:47,830
What do you want to eat?

975
03:25:47,831 --> 03:25:48,831
Tell me.

976
03:25:54,835 --> 03:26:00,370
I want to be turned around by a lot of men.

977
03:26:01,190 --> 03:26:02,350
You want to be turned around?

978
03:26:03,150 --> 03:26:04,310
You want to be turned around?

979
03:26:04,510 --> 03:26:05,570
And?

980
03:26:05,571 --> 03:26:06,571
And?

981
03:26:13,370 --> 03:26:15,570
Mama's poo.

982
03:26:17,850 --> 03:26:19,630
Mama's poo?

983
03:26:19,845 --> 03:26:21,165
What are you going to do with it?

984
03:26:23,420 --> 03:26:24,570
I want you to put it in.

985
03:26:24,670 --> 03:26:27,050
Where do you want to put it?

986
03:26:27,650 --> 03:26:29,830
Where do you want to put it?

987
03:26:29,831 --> 03:26:30,831
What do you want?

988
03:26:33,810 --> 03:26:35,410
I want you to put it in my mouth.

989
03:26:43,650 --> 03:26:45,690
What do you want me to do?

990
03:26:46,180 --> 03:26:49,230
I want you to put it in my mouth.

991
03:26:51,630 --> 03:26:53,070
You want me to put it in your mouth.

992
03:26:53,490 --> 03:26:55,650
If you say it once, I won't
put it in your mouth later.

993
03:26:55,651 --> 03:26:56,651
You can take it out.

994
03:26:57,110 --> 03:26:58,110
You can take it out.

995
03:26:58,730 --> 03:27:00,530
You don't need a rubber band?

996
03:27:01,390 --> 03:27:02,390
No rubber band.

997
03:27:02,670 --> 03:27:04,110
You all got it.

998
03:27:05,790 --> 03:27:07,630
You can use it raw.

999
03:27:08,290 --> 03:27:10,430
You can use it raw.

1000
03:27:11,490 --> 03:27:11,850
You can use it raw.

1001
03:27:11,851 --> 03:27:13,310
I like it raw.

1002
03:27:14,210 --> 03:27:15,510
You can use it raw.

1003
03:27:15,950 --> 03:27:16,350
You can get a lot.

1004
03:27:16,910 --> 03:27:18,070
You like it raw.

1005
03:27:18,510 --> 03:27:19,510
I like it raw.

1006
03:27:20,210 --> 03:27:21,650
I want to touch it.

1007
03:27:21,651 --> 03:27:23,690
Do you want to be messed up?

1008
03:27:24,250 --> 03:27:25,370
Say it to everyone.

1009
03:27:26,490 --> 03:27:28,090
Please mess me up.

1010
03:27:28,990 --> 03:27:29,990
Do you understand?

1011
03:27:30,030 --> 03:27:31,970
Is this enough?

1012
03:27:32,130 --> 03:27:34,730
Please mess up Uchiyo and Nagao.

1013
03:28:06,260 --> 03:28:09,670
Let's play a game together
because there are a lot of people.

1014
03:28:46,790 --> 03:28:48,890
I don't want to do it anymore.

1015
03:28:48,891 --> 03:28:50,930
I don't want to do it anymore.

1016
03:28:51,030 --> 03:29:00,350
I don't want to do it anymore.

1017
03:29:08,070 --> 03:29:09,690
You don't need a skirt anymore, do you?

1018
03:29:10,190 --> 03:29:11,450
It looks good on you.

1019
03:29:12,415 --> 03:29:13,990
You look really good without a skirt.

1020
03:29:18,560 --> 03:29:20,410
I'll give you a gift.

1021
03:29:20,411 --> 03:29:21,611
Do you want me to lift you up?

1022
03:29:52,590 --> 03:29:54,000
Yes, yes, yes….

1023
03:30:05,095 --> 03:30:06,335
He is licking his baby's belly.

1024
03:30:08,490 --> 03:30:10,410
It's good, isn't it?

1025
03:30:11,090 --> 03:30:12,630
He is enjoying it, isn't he?

1026
03:30:12,650 --> 03:30:13,650
Look!

1027
03:30:15,290 --> 03:30:16,630
He is licking his baby's belly.

1028
03:30:16,810 --> 03:30:19,370
There are still many people
who want to lick their belly, right?

1029
03:30:20,220 --> 03:30:21,690
He is licking.

1030
03:30:24,390 --> 03:30:26,470
Let me lick your belly.

1031
03:30:27,170 --> 03:30:28,290
I'm going to lick your neck.

1032
03:30:29,970 --> 03:30:31,610
Show me your neck.

1033
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:52,200
Do you want to lick your buttocks?

1034
03:30:53,400 --> 03:30:54,400
She loves her buttocks.

1035
03:30:55,460 --> 03:30:57,520
Let me see your buttocks.

1036
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:02,561
Your butt is also... No!

1037
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:04,040
No!

1038
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:06,440
No!

1039
03:31:10,780 --> 03:31:11,780
No!

1040
03:31:12,100 --> 03:31:13,100
No!

1041
03:31:13,280 --> 03:31:13,460
No!

1042
03:31:14,140 --> 03:31:14,460
No!

1043
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:16,040
No!

1044
03:31:16,140 --> 03:31:18,840
You were in a high place
a while ago, weren't you?

1045
03:31:19,520 --> 03:31:21,440
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

1046
03:31:22,240 --> 03:31:23,920
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

1047
03:31:23,940 --> 03:31:24,940
I'll pick it up.

1048
03:31:25,920 --> 03:31:27,900
I'll pick it up.

1049
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:33,300
I'll screw it in.

1050
03:31:36,290 --> 03:31:37,360
It's so close.

1051
03:31:48,410 --> 03:31:49,440
Good boy.

1052
03:31:49,480 --> 03:31:50,480
Good boy.

1053
03:32:01,060 --> 03:32:03,820
He is very energetic.

1054
03:32:04,840 --> 03:32:05,840
Look at his buttocks.

1055
03:32:20,090 --> 03:32:21,200
Where are you being licked?

1056
03:32:23,980 --> 03:32:25,220
On my butt.

1057
03:32:26,180 --> 03:32:30,220
There are many people who
want to be licked, so let's take turns.

1058
03:32:50,040 --> 03:32:51,860
What's wrong with your butt?

1059
03:32:57,580 --> 03:33:02,400
You want more, don't you?

1060
03:33:10,420 --> 03:33:15,340
You want to eat more, don't you?

1061
03:33:28,190 --> 03:33:43,820
I'm here!

1062
03:33:48,980 --> 03:33:49,980
You're here!

1063
03:33:50,260 --> 03:33:51,640
You're here!

1064
03:33:51,641 --> 03:33:53,720
You're here!

1065
03:33:54,860 --> 03:33:55,860
There are so many.

1066
03:33:56,220 --> 03:33:56,860
There are so many.

1067
03:33:56,861 --> 03:33:57,861
Look at her face.

1068
03:34:03,340 --> 03:34:06,340
She is standing on a man's leg.

1069
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:09,160
It feels so good.

1070
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:12,000
There are so many.

1071
03:34:17,320 --> 03:34:19,340
There are so many, so let's take turns.

1072
03:34:24,890 --> 03:34:26,400
Let's lick all of them.

1073
03:34:27,260 --> 03:34:28,260
I'll lick all of them.

1074
03:34:32,680 --> 03:34:34,940
It's good.

1075
03:34:35,360 --> 03:34:35,560
Is it good?

1076
03:34:35,840 --> 03:34:36,840
It's good.

1077
03:34:38,380 --> 03:34:39,940
I'm going to cry.

1078
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:41,980
There are a lot of them.

1079
03:34:45,210 --> 03:34:46,210
It feels good.

1080
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:05,260
I can't do it anymore.

1081
03:35:07,080 --> 03:35:09,660
I can't do it anymore.

1082
03:35:10,470 --> 03:35:11,460
I can't do it anymore.

1083
03:35:11,461 --> 03:35:12,461
I'm hungry.

1084
03:35:22,590 --> 03:35:24,180
Let me taste it.

1085
03:35:27,680 --> 03:35:29,060
Who is going to eat it?

1086
03:35:29,620 --> 03:35:30,620
Hold it.

1087
03:35:33,740 --> 03:35:34,740
It's going to get cold.

1088
03:35:34,741 --> 03:35:35,741
I'm sorry.

1089
03:35:39,400 --> 03:35:41,100
I want you to eat this.

1090
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:44,300
This and this.

1091
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:50,240
Your face is covered with chimpanzees.

1092
03:35:53,340 --> 03:35:55,320
Look at the side camera.

1093
03:35:56,580 --> 03:35:57,600
How do you feel?

1094
03:35:58,540 --> 03:36:00,220
How do you feel with a lot of chimpanzees?

1095
03:36:00,760 --> 03:36:01,760
What do you think?

1096
03:36:04,740 --> 03:36:04,860
Are you happy?

1097
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:05,680
Yes.

1098
03:36:05,681 --> 03:36:06,681
That's good.

1099
03:36:07,520 --> 03:36:08,520
Talk to me.

1100
03:36:09,480 --> 03:36:10,480
Talk to me.

1101
03:36:11,860 --> 03:36:12,860
Talk to me.

1102
03:36:13,800 --> 03:36:18,060
Talk to me.

1103
03:36:21,580 --> 03:36:23,260
It's broken.

1104
03:36:25,820 --> 03:36:27,100
It's broken.

1105
03:36:29,500 --> 03:36:30,500
Oh, it's wrinkled.

1106
03:36:32,560 --> 03:36:33,560
Oh, it feels good.

1107
03:36:35,620 --> 03:36:37,440
I've never made you eat so much at once.

1108
03:36:39,830 --> 03:36:40,920
Taste it.

1109
03:36:55,360 --> 03:36:57,800
It feels good.

1110
03:37:11,760 --> 03:37:12,980
I'm sleepy.

1111
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:14,500
You are sleepy.

1112
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:19,580
I want to go to bed.

1113
03:37:22,370 --> 03:37:23,440
You are sleepy.

1114
03:37:24,280 --> 03:37:25,280
I'm sleepy.

1115
03:37:28,860 --> 03:37:30,180
Have you finished drinking water?

1116
03:37:34,740 --> 03:37:35,740
It's delicious.

1117
03:37:41,570 --> 03:37:42,570
It feels good.

1118
03:38:14,130 --> 03:38:16,140
What's wrong?

1119
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:17,280
What's wrong with your face?

1120
03:38:17,281 --> 03:38:18,281
You're getting bigger.

1121
03:38:24,950 --> 03:38:25,950
What's wrong?

1122
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:29,740
What's wrong?

1123
03:38:31,350 --> 03:38:32,660
What's wrong?

1124
03:38:43,340 --> 03:38:44,400
What's the matter?

1125
03:38:50,100 --> 03:38:52,260
Where's the sofa?

1126
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:08,980
Look, look, look.

1127
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:10,120
Who wants to drink?

1128
03:39:10,400 --> 03:39:11,540
Can I drink?

1129
03:39:11,880 --> 03:39:12,880
Let's do it.

1130
03:39:15,440 --> 03:39:16,500
Open your mouth.

1131
03:39:24,900 --> 03:39:26,400
It's amazing, isn't it?

1132
03:39:28,320 --> 03:39:30,360
It's amazing.

1133
03:39:31,880 --> 03:39:32,640
Look, look.

1134
03:39:32,641 --> 03:39:33,641
Please do it one by one.

1135
03:39:45,630 --> 03:39:47,550
Oh, great!

1136
03:39:47,870 --> 03:39:49,190
I'm glad that you drink it.

1137
03:39:56,810 --> 03:40:01,430
Wow, you are pulling the string.

1138
03:40:01,431 --> 03:40:03,830
Wow, it's amazing.

1139
03:40:03,930 --> 03:40:04,930
Does it feel good?

1140
03:40:05,450 --> 03:40:06,870
It feels good.

1141
03:40:08,110 --> 03:40:09,930
There's a better one than your finger.

1142
03:40:10,250 --> 03:40:11,250
Do you want it?

1143
03:40:11,610 --> 03:40:12,610
Do you want this?

1144
03:40:13,350 --> 03:40:14,350
It's raw.

1145
03:40:15,630 --> 03:40:16,170
It's raw.

1146
03:40:16,410 --> 03:40:17,410
It's good.

1147
03:40:18,350 --> 03:40:19,350
I'll put it on.

1148
03:40:33,330 --> 03:40:34,330
Can I go in?

1149
03:40:34,690 --> 03:40:35,690
It's a bear.

1150
03:40:38,410 --> 03:40:44,890
Can I go in?

1151
03:40:46,100 --> 03:40:48,570
It's a bear.

1152
03:40:48,970 --> 03:40:49,970
It's a bear.

1153
03:40:50,170 --> 03:40:51,910
It's a bear.

1154
03:40:52,200 --> 03:41:15,420
It's a bear.

1155
03:41:15,421 --> 03:41:16,421
I'm going.

1156
03:41:21,560 --> 03:41:22,560
I'm going.

1157
03:41:23,680 --> 03:41:25,840
I'll take it out.

1158
03:41:26,140 --> 03:41:27,340
Help me.

1159
03:41:27,480 --> 03:41:29,360
Help me.

1160
03:41:29,660 --> 03:41:31,200
You are still breathing.

1161
03:41:31,201 --> 03:41:33,760
You are still breathing.

1162
03:41:48,960 --> 03:41:54,030
He is coming out.

1163
03:41:58,050 --> 03:41:59,090
He is still breathing.

1164
03:41:59,091 --> 03:42:05,900
The dog is showing its face.

1165
03:42:08,460 --> 03:42:10,980
It's warm.

1166
03:42:12,060 --> 03:42:12,580
Is it warm?

1167
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:14,000
Yes, it is.

1168
03:42:14,110 --> 03:42:15,190
Did you want me to do more?

1169
03:42:16,600 --> 03:42:17,600
More?

1170
03:42:19,640 --> 03:42:21,880
It's not enough yet.

1171
03:42:22,120 --> 03:42:23,120
It's not enough yet.

1172
03:42:37,300 --> 03:42:39,280
It's cold.

1173
03:42:39,330 --> 03:42:41,160
I'm so embarrassed.

1174
03:42:41,280 --> 03:42:42,300
You're so embarrassed.

1175
03:42:46,050 --> 03:42:56,280
You wanted to do this, didn't you?

1176
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:58,820
You want more and more, don't you?

1177
03:43:00,900 --> 03:43:01,980
Here it comes.

1178
03:43:10,200 --> 03:43:13,040
We don't have any toys for you.

1179
03:43:13,265 --> 03:43:14,385
You don't need toys, do you?

1180
03:43:14,950 --> 03:43:16,240
No, I don't.

1181
03:43:16,241 --> 03:43:16,860
You don't need toys?

1182
03:43:16,861 --> 03:43:18,360
What's wrong?

1183
03:43:27,860 --> 03:43:28,080
There is something wrong with your butt.

1184
03:43:28,760 --> 03:43:34,140
Please try again.

1185
03:43:34,141 --> 03:43:36,300
Pull your butt a little more.

1186
03:43:36,780 --> 03:43:39,880
Pull your butt a little more.

1187
03:43:40,930 --> 03:43:56,940
Hold your butt in.

1188
03:43:57,140 --> 03:44:16,110
Did you say it?

1189
03:44:16,350 --> 03:44:17,370
Oh, oh, oh.

1190
03:44:23,100 --> 03:44:24,100
Oh, he's gone.

1191
03:44:24,320 --> 03:44:25,320
He's gone.

1192
03:44:25,860 --> 03:44:27,360
He's shaking.

1193
03:44:29,600 --> 03:44:31,080
He's mixed up.

1194
03:44:33,880 --> 03:44:35,540
He's tired.

1195
03:44:36,260 --> 03:44:37,380
He's got a pain in his butt.

1196
03:44:37,620 --> 03:44:38,740
He's got a pain in his butt.

1197
03:44:39,600 --> 03:44:40,780
He's tired.

1198
03:44:41,560 --> 03:44:43,540
He's a little more up.

1199
03:44:45,270 --> 03:44:46,270
He's a little more up.

1200
03:44:47,220 --> 03:44:51,560
He's a little more up.

1201
03:44:51,561 --> 03:44:54,340
You can finally see the inside of the room.

1202
03:45:03,070 --> 03:45:04,650
It feels good.

1203
03:45:53,425 --> 03:45:55,930
The next person is waiting for you.

1204
03:45:57,170 --> 03:45:58,570
Come in.

1205
03:46:02,180 --> 03:46:07,200
This is a penguin.

1206
03:46:10,280 --> 03:46:11,300
Wow!

1207
03:46:12,520 --> 03:46:14,440
You've grown a lot.

1208
03:46:56,380 --> 03:47:14,690
You're going to the hospital?

1209
03:47:17,210 --> 03:47:17,530
Thank you.

1210
03:47:17,531 --> 03:47:18,571
She's out of the hospital.

1211
03:48:26,470 --> 03:48:27,890
She's going to get out.

1212
03:48:41,910 --> 03:48:42,910
Oh, ah.

1213
03:48:43,320 --> 03:48:44,630
Ah, it feels good.

1214
03:48:45,870 --> 03:48:49,690
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1215
03:48:49,691 --> 03:48:50,691
Ah, it's warm.

1216
03:48:51,380 --> 03:48:52,970
Oh, it feels good.

1217
03:48:53,650 --> 03:48:57,680
I'll put a lot inside.

1218
03:48:58,700 --> 03:49:01,420
Uh, Mom, please put this in.

1219
03:49:01,760 --> 03:49:02,900
I'll put it inside.

1220
03:49:04,160 --> 03:49:05,160
Inside.

1221
03:49:05,840 --> 03:49:07,480
Oh, it's going.

1222
03:49:08,140 --> 03:49:09,140
Aah.

1223
03:49:11,830 --> 03:49:14,560
They are taking
stretches to reduce fatigue.

1224
03:49:14,561 --> 03:49:15,561
It's too hot.

1225
03:49:16,420 --> 03:49:18,020
It feels good.

1226
03:49:40,210 --> 03:49:52,800
It's slippery.

1227
03:50:05,900 --> 03:50:07,570
I'm massaging her hip joints.

1228
03:50:07,890 --> 03:50:09,250
I'll massage the back of her neck.

1229
03:50:24,390 --> 03:50:25,390
You are back!

1230
03:50:27,990 --> 03:50:29,850
How do you feel?

1231
03:50:30,010 --> 03:50:31,850
Do you feel like you
are being carried around?

1232
03:50:34,460 --> 03:50:35,460
It's the best!

1233
03:50:36,570 --> 03:50:38,950
You are being carried around, aren't you?

1234
03:50:39,350 --> 03:50:40,350
It's the best!

1235
03:50:48,510 --> 03:50:49,510
I'm just going to sleep.

1236
03:51:24,520 --> 03:51:25,881
You can't sleep
You are a good girl.

1237
03:51:41,710 --> 03:51:44,030
It's good to put a lot of
sauce in the dumpling, isn't it?

1238
03:52:04,710 --> 03:52:06,110
I'll try to make it a big dumpling.

1239
03:52:12,350 --> 03:52:14,190
Feels good, right?

1240
03:52:45,690 --> 03:52:46,690
Ah!

1241
03:52:51,070 --> 03:52:51,090
Ah!

1242
03:52:51,670 --> 03:52:51,830
Ah!

1243
03:52:52,010 --> 03:52:52,330
Ah!

1244
03:52:52,510 --> 03:52:52,530
Ah!

1245
03:52:52,531 --> 03:52:53,771
I'll try to tighten your belly.

1246
03:52:53,890 --> 03:52:54,150
Ah!

1247
03:52:54,250 --> 03:52:55,250
Ah!

1248
03:52:56,210 --> 03:52:57,210
Ah!

1249
03:52:57,930 --> 03:52:58,930
Ah!

1250
03:52:58,990 --> 03:52:59,990
Ah!

1251
03:53:01,890 --> 03:53:02,050
Ah!

1252
03:53:02,890 --> 03:53:03,090
Ah!

1253
03:53:03,270 --> 03:53:04,270
Ah!

1254
03:53:06,710 --> 03:53:07,870
You're having a hard time.

1255
03:53:10,790 --> 03:53:11,790
Ah!

1256
03:53:21,990 --> 03:53:24,570
Does it taste good?

1257
03:53:31,640 --> 03:53:34,610
Are you enjoy?

1258
03:53:35,010 --> 03:53:36,830
Yes!

1259
03:53:37,090 --> 03:53:40,030
Are you enjoying?

1260
03:54:27,510 --> 03:54:28,420
Can you see it?

1261
03:54:28,480 --> 03:54:29,520
Can you see it from below?

1262
03:54:29,920 --> 03:54:31,040
You can see it in full view.

1263
03:54:46,700 --> 03:54:50,560
Wow!

1264
03:54:50,700 --> 03:54:51,700
Wow!

1265
03:55:10,050 --> 03:55:10,720
It's amazing.

1266
03:55:10,721 --> 03:55:11,721
It's amazing.

1267
03:55:31,520 --> 03:55:33,410
Oh, you can see it well when you zoom in.

1268
03:55:34,610 --> 03:55:36,250
Oh, you can see it well when you zoom in.

1269
03:55:38,640 --> 03:55:40,090
It's amazing.

1270
03:55:43,870 --> 03:55:44,950
I'm going to the bathroom.

1271
03:57:12,860 --> 03:57:14,860
Don't do that.

1272
03:57:54,265 --> 03:58:02,640
You want something in
your mouth, don't you?

1273
03:58:05,210 --> 03:58:07,500
You're thirsty, aren't you?

1274
03:58:09,100 --> 03:58:10,940
Do you want me to give
you something to drink?

1275
03:58:12,880 --> 03:58:13,880
What do you want?

1276
03:58:15,500 --> 03:58:16,500
Juice.

1277
03:58:17,440 --> 03:58:18,080
You want juice?

1278
03:58:18,280 --> 03:58:19,280
Juice.

1279
03:58:19,460 --> 03:58:20,780
Then I'll give it to you.

1280
03:58:24,580 --> 03:58:26,180
Please give me juice.

1281
03:58:27,980 --> 03:58:28,980
Give him a treat.

1282
03:58:29,510 --> 03:58:30,560
Give him a treat.

1283
03:58:30,561 --> 03:58:31,561
Don't open your mouth.

1284
03:58:59,270 --> 03:59:00,630
I can see you have a lot of it.

1285
03:59:01,980 --> 03:59:03,890
You can't drink it yet.

1286
03:59:03,891 --> 03:59:05,530
You can't drink it yet.

1287
03:59:21,580 --> 03:59:25,050
You are too energetic.

1288
03:59:29,270 --> 03:59:30,270
Open your mouth.

1289
03:59:30,490 --> 03:59:31,490
Open your mouth.

1290
03:59:43,250 --> 03:59:45,450
Don't spill it.

1291
04:00:02,470 --> 04:00:04,310
I wonder if there's
anyone else who can do it.

1292
04:00:06,660 --> 04:00:09,220
You want to fill your mouth, don't you?

1293
04:00:10,900 --> 04:00:11,900
Don't spill it.

1294
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:18,660
I'm going to go in a little more.

1295
04:00:18,661 --> 04:00:19,661
Let's go.

1296
04:00:29,460 --> 04:00:30,640
Come forward.

1297
04:00:38,420 --> 04:00:39,420
Are you all right?

1298
04:00:43,800 --> 04:00:44,600
Are you all right?

1299
04:00:44,601 --> 04:00:45,601
Are you okay?

1300
04:00:45,900 --> 04:00:46,900
Can't you let it out?

1301
04:00:48,360 --> 04:00:49,360
Okay.

1302
04:00:49,540 --> 04:00:53,920
Drink it in your mouth at
the same time as you go.

1303
04:00:54,260 --> 04:00:55,260
Okay.

1304
04:00:57,400 --> 04:00:58,600
It will follow you from below.

1305
04:01:14,600 --> 04:01:15,600
Oh, it's hot.

1306
04:01:21,640 --> 04:01:30,040
Oh, it's hot.

1307
04:01:31,220 --> 04:01:33,680
How does it taste?

1308
04:01:33,840 --> 04:01:37,600
It's fishy.

1309
04:01:40,540 --> 04:01:41,960
It's fishy and delicious.

1310
04:01:41,961 --> 04:01:45,680
It was good, wasn't it?

1311
04:03:00,320 --> 04:03:18,860
I'm glad I can take care of him.

1312
04:03:30,010 --> 04:03:36,100
He's still a baby, so I
have to take care of him.

1313
04:03:37,600 --> 04:03:47,920
I'm going to put him in the room.

1314
04:03:52,560 --> 04:04:11,120
It's a little hard, but I don't mind.

1315
04:04:15,700 --> 04:04:20,260
I found a lot of hair on the floor.

1316
04:04:20,580 --> 04:04:26,060
It's also a little hard,
but I'm glad I use it.

1317
04:04:26,160 --> 04:04:27,720
I'm trying to make it look like a baby.

1318
04:04:30,480 --> 04:04:33,380
I'm going to take it off.

1319
04:04:34,630 --> 04:04:38,640
It hurts.

1320
04:04:58,660 --> 04:05:00,110
I'm going to take it off.

1321
04:05:03,930 --> 04:05:06,910
Put your hand on the back.

1322
04:05:08,010 --> 04:05:09,010
I'm going to take it off.

1323
04:05:14,010 --> 04:05:16,750
Oh, you want to go down, don't you?

1324
04:05:22,940 --> 04:05:23,940
There's more.

1325
04:05:41,610 --> 04:05:42,840
Oh, you're so fluffy.

1326
04:05:45,420 --> 04:05:46,540
Oh no, you're going to slip.

1327
04:05:52,400 --> 04:05:54,720
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1328
04:06:24,010 --> 04:06:25,010
You are licking him.

1329
04:06:25,810 --> 04:06:27,290
You have a lot of sebum on your face.

1330
04:06:33,470 --> 04:06:36,110
Sometimes, you see, you
have a lot of sebum on your face.

1331
04:06:38,190 --> 04:06:39,190
Let's go.

1332
04:06:50,850 --> 04:06:51,770
Look down.

1333
04:06:51,771 --> 04:06:52,771
Look, there is a pee.

1334
04:07:04,830 --> 04:07:05,970
Do you like it?

1335
04:07:07,810 --> 04:07:10,410
Are you happy?

1336
04:07:26,690 --> 04:07:28,670
What is she saying?

1337
04:08:06,690 --> 04:08:14,770
What is she saying?

1338
04:08:15,790 --> 04:08:16,630
What are you doing?

1339
04:08:16,631 --> 04:08:17,631
It's okay.

1340
04:08:20,320 --> 04:08:24,420
It's okay.

1341
04:08:25,860 --> 04:08:44,330
What's wrong?

1342
04:09:29,900 --> 04:09:31,820
The cat is very happy
to be able to see its mom.

1343
04:09:41,180 --> 04:09:43,740
I'm worried about her.

1344
04:09:47,600 --> 04:09:48,540
The cat has a lump on her face.

1345
04:09:48,541 --> 04:09:49,541
Wow, amazing.

1346
04:09:51,240 --> 04:09:53,080
I'm going to put her back.

1347
04:10:47,140 --> 04:10:48,300
The cats are lined up.

1348
04:10:48,301 --> 04:10:49,301
Let's go to the back.

1349
04:11:16,305 --> 04:12:02,860
You can't go there.

1350
04:12:07,540 --> 04:12:08,180
Let me open the door for you.

1351
04:12:08,181 --> 04:12:09,181
It's hot, isn't it?

1352
04:12:10,560 --> 04:12:11,760
Let me close the door for you.

1353
04:12:53,610 --> 04:12:54,950
Oh, it's hot.

1354
04:12:55,510 --> 04:12:56,730
It's hot, isn't it?

1355
04:12:57,550 --> 04:12:58,550
It's hot.

1356
04:13:08,910 --> 04:13:11,040
It's overflowing.

1357
04:13:11,380 --> 04:13:12,380
It's overflowing.

1358
04:13:19,520 --> 04:13:25,480
Let's go.

1359
04:13:26,200 --> 04:13:27,200
I'll show you.

1360
04:14:18,400 --> 04:14:44,850
Look at this.

1361
04:14:45,980 --> 04:14:47,530
Wow.

1362
04:14:47,531 --> 04:14:48,531
Oh, I see.

1363
04:14:52,210 --> 04:14:53,210
It's about to leak.

1364
04:14:54,210 --> 04:14:54,850
What?

1365
04:14:55,010 --> 04:14:55,470
I'm sorry.

1366
04:14:55,650 --> 04:14:56,710
Is it leaking?

1367
04:14:57,230 --> 04:14:58,230
It's leaking.

1368
04:14:59,090 --> 04:15:01,230
I'm sorry.

1369
04:15:03,530 --> 04:15:05,570
Oh, it feels so good.

1370
04:15:06,490 --> 04:15:07,490
It's leaking.

1371
04:15:12,050 --> 04:15:13,050
I'm sorry.

1372
04:15:13,810 --> 04:15:14,430
It's leaking.

1373
04:15:14,710 --> 04:15:15,710
I'm sorry.

1374
04:15:22,130 --> 04:15:24,060
Let's take a look at this.

1375
04:15:28,620 --> 04:15:29,690
Look back.

1376
04:15:31,390 --> 04:15:33,210
What's this?

1377
04:15:45,250 --> 04:15:59,140
What's going on?

1378
04:17:43,370 --> 04:17:44,370
I'm sorry.

1379
04:17:55,730 --> 04:18:00,360
Are you okay?

1380
04:18:05,520 --> 04:18:07,500
It feels so good.

1381
04:18:18,170 --> 04:18:19,250
It feels so good.

1382
04:18:19,251 --> 04:18:20,251
Ah!

1383
04:18:20,870 --> 04:18:21,870
Ah!

1384
04:18:23,570 --> 04:18:24,570
Aik!

1385
04:18:24,930 --> 04:18:45,800
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1386
04:18:45,850 --> 04:18:47,080
20 seconds left.

1387
04:18:52,500 --> 04:18:53,500
Ah, feels good.

1388
04:18:57,590 --> 04:18:59,110
My nose feels really good.

1389
04:19:01,830 --> 04:19:02,830
Ah!

1390
04:19:24,170 --> 04:19:25,740
Aik, that's enough.

1391
04:19:29,540 --> 04:19:31,020
Let's go.

1392
04:19:31,290 --> 04:19:33,320
Let's go.

1393
04:19:34,800 --> 04:19:37,180
Let's go.

1394
04:19:37,181 --> 04:19:38,181
Let's go.

1395
04:19:56,065 --> 04:20:04,870
Can you see it?

1396
04:20:07,810 --> 04:20:09,070
It's amazing.

1397
04:20:18,750 --> 04:20:19,830
Now, you can close the lid.

1398
04:20:20,900 --> 04:20:21,900
Don't let the water out.

1399
04:20:25,080 --> 04:20:28,990
Let's check how much
seeds are in the earth.

1400
04:20:31,330 --> 04:20:33,130
Don't let the water out.

1401
04:20:33,610 --> 04:20:35,130
No, no, no, no.

1402
04:20:36,350 --> 04:20:37,430
A little more.

1403
04:21:17,860 --> 04:21:19,860
I can see it now.

1404
04:21:23,040 --> 04:21:25,380
I think it's a little higher.

1405
04:21:27,380 --> 04:21:28,900
I'll put it in this hole.

1406
04:21:38,150 --> 04:21:41,240
There are people who squeak all day, right?

1407
04:21:42,030 --> 04:21:43,350
You can see it around you, right?

1408
04:21:44,570 --> 04:21:46,060
They say they want to put it out.

1409
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:48,500
I'll put it out.

1410
04:21:50,930 --> 04:21:53,180
Please add more water.

1411
04:21:55,530 --> 04:21:56,610
Where do you want it to be?

1412
04:21:59,725 --> 04:22:00,780
In this hole.

1413
04:22:02,060 --> 04:22:03,060
In this hole, right?

1414
04:22:03,520 --> 04:22:04,520
In this hole.

1415
04:22:05,540 --> 04:22:06,940
Close your eyes and put it in.

1416
04:22:08,610 --> 04:22:11,480
Please close your eyes and put it in.

1417
04:22:15,630 --> 04:22:16,990
It looks like it's going to spill.

1418
04:22:29,470 --> 04:22:30,470
Did it spill?

1419
04:23:10,020 --> 04:23:20,220
It's been a while since I've had a bath, so
I'm a little nervous, but I'll do my best.

1420
04:23:20,221 --> 04:23:25,100
How many baths did you have?

1421
04:23:26,180 --> 04:23:27,180
I had three baths.

1422
04:23:29,470 --> 04:23:31,320
You look like a healthy brother.

1423
04:23:34,420 --> 04:23:35,420
I'll cut your hair.

1424
04:23:42,950 --> 04:23:47,010
It's coming off.

1425
04:23:50,070 --> 04:23:53,310
It's not coming off at all.

1426
04:23:54,130 --> 04:24:05,170
I don't think it's coming off.

1427
04:24:05,620 --> 04:24:07,170
You can push it.

1428
04:24:09,350 --> 04:24:10,350
Try it.

1429
04:24:13,680 --> 04:24:14,870
It's coming out.

1430
04:24:16,010 --> 04:24:17,450
It's a lump.

1431
04:24:20,190 --> 04:24:21,190
It's coming out.

1432
04:24:22,120 --> 04:24:23,120
It's like a lump.

1433
04:24:23,610 --> 04:24:26,690
This is the last one.

1434
04:24:29,740 --> 04:24:40,890
It's coming out.

1435
04:24:43,930 --> 04:24:44,930
Wow, amazing.

1436
04:24:47,030 --> 04:24:48,210
One more time.

1437
04:24:48,890 --> 04:24:51,930
Wow, amazing.

1438
04:24:51,931 --> 04:24:52,931
Pull yourself together.

1439
04:24:53,890 --> 04:24:55,350
Wow, amazing.

1440
04:24:55,720 --> 04:24:56,720
It's coming out and in.

1441
04:24:57,190 --> 04:24:58,730
It's a surface tension.

1442
04:24:59,170 --> 04:25:00,170
Wow, amazing.

1443
04:25:00,750 --> 04:25:04,080
If you laugh, it will come out.

1444
04:25:04,450 --> 04:25:05,450
Oh, it's spilling.

1445
04:25:05,810 --> 04:25:06,810
It's heavy.

1446
04:25:09,100 --> 04:25:10,410
Touch it now.

1447
04:25:11,010 --> 04:25:12,010
You can touch him now.

1448
04:25:15,650 --> 04:25:18,530
He comes to me when I laugh.

1449
04:25:19,650 --> 04:25:22,350
He is trying to hide his face.

1450
04:25:24,420 --> 04:25:29,730
It's been a long time.

1451
04:25:30,570 --> 04:25:31,630
He is getting smaller.

1452
04:25:40,410 --> 04:25:41,410
Don't spill it.

1453
04:25:45,475 --> 04:25:48,030
How was it today?

1454
04:25:50,410 --> 04:25:51,410
How was it?

1455
04:25:53,430 --> 04:25:54,430
I'm happy.

1456
04:25:56,530 --> 04:25:58,650
You wanted to do it with
a lot of people, didn't you?

1457
04:25:59,760 --> 04:26:01,990
I'm happy that my dream came true.

1458
04:26:01,991 --> 04:26:02,150
Yes.

1459
04:26:02,960 --> 04:26:04,360
You wanted to be loved by everyone.

1460
04:26:06,650 --> 04:26:08,770
You wanted to be loved by everyone.

1461
04:26:08,771 --> 04:26:08,950
Yes.

1462
04:26:09,630 --> 04:26:11,030
You wanted to be loved, didn't you?

1463
04:26:11,185 --> 04:26:12,385
I'm glad your dream came true.

1464
04:26:12,970 --> 04:26:13,970
Yes.

1465
04:26:16,610 --> 04:26:17,610
Tomorrow again?

1466
04:26:19,650 --> 04:26:20,650
Tomorrow.

1467
04:26:20,690 --> 04:26:21,690
Tomorrow?

1468
04:26:22,810 --> 04:26:25,170
You have to get more people tomorrow.

1469
04:26:26,010 --> 04:26:26,370
Yes.

1470
04:26:26,790 --> 04:26:27,790
You're greedy.

1471
04:26:35,310 --> 04:26:41,430
Thank you so much for giving
me a lot of energy and love.
