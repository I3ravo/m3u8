1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's take a look at the camera.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can I ask you some questions?

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
May I ask your name?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, I'm Utaba Kremia.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's your current job?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm a regular worker.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you going back to work today?

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes, I'm going back to work.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you for your hard work.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Are you married?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not married, but I got engaged last month.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, you got engaged. Congratulations.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Who is your partner?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm in a relationship in the company, so I got engaged with my colleague.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How long have you been dating?

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
About two years.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I see.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then you got engaged and got engaged.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I see.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is a matter of consultation.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is it okay to have a cream?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You seem to be worried.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Isn't it a bright type?

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes. It's a dark side.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I see.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is it a so-called dull?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What kind of marriage partner is it?

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's about the same as the marriage contract.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I see.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you know that you were engaged?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, I do.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did you announce it?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, I did.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I see.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Pamela, Cremia, congratulations on your engagement.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Congratulations!

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Congratulations!

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Congratulations!

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Murase,

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to ask you to go to the Cremia next week.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please take good care of Primia.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Keep up the good work.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to be the mayor of Sendai.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just the two of you?

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The person in charge this time was Mr. Murase, right?

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is she your boss?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My name is Choshi.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What kind of person do you usually meet?

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm usually kind.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I met Murase-san at the hotel in Chosaki.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We became a couple.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A couple in the same room?

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just the two of you?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, just the two of us.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You couldn't go back to the room?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We couldn't go back by hand.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who told you that?

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Murase-san.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,800
So that's what you said, I see.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Were you okay with that?

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I thought it couldn't be helped.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,400
That's what I was doing at first.

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,300
Is it the same room as the boss's room?

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,400
Yeah, I think so.

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,000
I wonder if it's the same as the boss's room.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,320
Look, the hotel is like a conter this time of the year.

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,720
You know, Tamura and I are getting married.

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,040
I don't have a ring, but I have a wife.

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
It's okay.

84
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Nothing weird will happen, right?

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Yeah.

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,960
Anyway, let's get ready for the next meeting.

87
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,480
Okay?

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah.

89
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Nice to meet you.

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
This is a great project.

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,880
We're going to start this project next month.

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Thank you.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Thank you.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,880
I'd like to hand over the contract to Ms. Cremia.

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Is that okay with you?

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
I understand.

97
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Excuse me.

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Excuse me, this way please.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's go.

100
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Boss, the documents are ready.

101
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Oh, thank you.

102
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Are you going back to the hotel?

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:12,880
But before that, if you don't drink the tea that was served, it will be rude, so drink it all.

104
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Yes.

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Then let's go back to the hotel.

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,880
I don't remember much after returning from the meeting.

108
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Where did you go from the meeting? The hotel?

109
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
I went back to the hotel.

110
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
You don't go to school on the way home?

111
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I feel like I'm losing my strength on the way home.

112
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Do you remember anything?

113
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Yes.

114
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
I see.

115
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
What happened after you got back from the hotel?

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
After I got back from the hotel...

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I realized I was naked.

118
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Naked?

119
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,880
What do you mean?

120
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I was raped.

121
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
I see.

122
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
It's hard to say, isn't it?

123
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Yes.

124
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Thank you for telling me.

125
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Is your heart okay?

126
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm fine.

127
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Did you wake up in the middle of the night?

128
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I woke up in the middle of the night.

129
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,880
How did you feel?

130
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
I was so sad.

131
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Wow

132
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Oh...

133
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Oh...

134
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Hmm

135
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Hmm

136
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Hmm

137
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Hmm

138
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Hmm

139
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Hmm

140
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Hmm

141
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
It feels so good.

142
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
It feels like I'm in a dream.

143
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,160
This feels like a dream, doesn't it?

144
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I love you

145
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,660
What are you doing?

146
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
Are you okay?

147
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Are you feeling good?

148
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
I'm sorry.

149
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Please don't do this to me.

150
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,660
It's too late to hide it now.

151
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
What do you think?

152
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
It's all stretched out.

153
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Stop it.

154
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
That feels good.

155
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Stop it.

156
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
I said it in my dream, right?

157
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
Stop it.

158
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
Stop it.

159
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Please don't do this to me.

160
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Please don't do this to me.

161
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Please don't do this to me.

162
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
No!

163
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Feels good, huh?

164
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Please stop.

165
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,660
Your hips are moving.

166
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Please stop.

167
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Why are your hips moving?

168
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
Please stop.

169
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Please stop.

170
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
That's enough.

171
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Please stop.

172
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Oh, my God.

173
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
I'm sorry.

174
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,660
I'm sorry.

175
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
What happened?

176
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,660
I'm sorry.

177
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
I'm sorry.

178
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,660
No, no, no, no, no, no...

179
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Is it good to give me a massage?

180
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,660
No, I don't feel like it.

181
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Then why are you moving your hips?

182
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Do you like this?

183
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,660
No, no, no...

184
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
Ouch!

185
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
It's so tight.

186
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,660
You're kidding me, aren't you?

187
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,960
I shouldn't have slept too much...

188
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,760
...

189
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,760
It was too early to clean up.

190
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
What are you doing?

191
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
I felt so good.

192
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,760
I'm sorry.

193
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
I'm sorry.

194
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
I'm sorry.

195
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I'm sorry.

196
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm sorry.

197
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
I'm sorry.

198
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm sorry.

199
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
It was really good.

200
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Please don't touch me.

201
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
It feels good.

202
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Please don't touch me.

203
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
What are you two doing?

204
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
What?

205
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
What did you do?

206
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
You're all wet.

207
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Shut up.

208
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
I'm sorry.

209
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,760
If you find out about this, you'll be in trouble tonight.

210
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
You'll be in trouble, right?

211
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Shut up about this.

212
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
What about the engine?

213
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
You'll be in trouble, too.

214
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
You look like this.

215
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Well, don't look so sad.

216
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Have fun.

217
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
What?

218
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,760
I see. That's a bit too much.

219
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Yes.

220
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm sorry to say this, but this is a recording.

221
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Yes.

222
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,760
How was it?

223
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,760
How was it?

224
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
I really didn't like it.

225
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
But even if I refused,

226
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
it continued.

227
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Did you resist?

228
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Yes, I resisted,

229
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
but I couldn't get any strength.

230
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Maybe something strange

231
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,760
You may have been involved in it.

232
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
You don't remember, do you?

233
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
No, I don't.

234
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
That's a bit scary.

235
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,760
What did you do after it was over?

236
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,760
After I regained consciousness, I called my boyfriend.

237
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
You called him?

238
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Yes.

239
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Do you remember what you said on the phone?

240
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Yes.

241
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Did you tell him?

242
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,760
No, of course not.

243
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
I see.

244
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Yes.

245
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,760
So you broke up with Murase?

246
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Yes, but he still threatened me.

247
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,760
That's all I could do.

248
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Hello?

249
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Yes.

250
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm alone at the hotel right now.

251
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,760
I'll go back to Tokyo when I'm done tomorrow.

252
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
I'm lonely because I can't see you.

253
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I'll make you dinner when I get home tomorrow.

254
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Okay, then see you tomorrow.

255
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Okay.

256
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Oil, huh?

257
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,760
You can't do anything about it, can you?

258
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Right?

259
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,760
If you find out about this, you're going to throw out your marriage contract, right?

260
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:40,760
If you find out about this, you're going to break the engagement, right?

261
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Is that okay?

262
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Why don't you say anything?

263
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
You don't want to say anything at all, do you?

264
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Please tell me.

265
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Did you feel that way earlier?

266
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,760
But you have such a nice body.

267
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Mom...

268
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
Tell me.

269
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
Do you like this body?

270
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
I like it.

271
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,760
You're not satisfied, are you?

272
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
You're not interested in sex, are you?

273
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
You're a whore.

274
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
What do you think?

275
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
What?

276
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
What's wrong?

277
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
You're not interested in sex, are you?

278
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
Are you going to do it again?

279
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,760
I'm a strong man.

280
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
He's back.

281
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
What's wrong?

282
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
What?

283
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm just having fun.

284
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
It doesn't matter what I've done.

285
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
No matter how many times you do it.

286
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I got it.

287
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Ok, it's time for your medicine.

288
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
What is it?

289
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
What is it?

290
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I told you it's time for your medicine.

291
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
I don't want it.

292
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,760
He is saying that he is going to be serious.

293
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,760
I will tell Tamura.

294
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
I will tell Tamura.

295
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
I was invited.

296
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I was invited by Gunya.

297
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I was invited and did it.

298
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
Let's open it.

299
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
What is this?

300
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
It's a medicine for your feelings.

301
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm sorry.

302
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
I'm sorry.

303
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I'm sorry.

304
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
What?

305
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,760
I'm sorry.

306
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
It's getting better.

307
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,660
Tr credibility

308
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,260
Didn't it feel better?

309
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,500
what about now?

310
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
I'm sorry.

311
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
It's getting better.

312
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Do I have to do it again?

313
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
No.

314
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,500
I've done it once, twice, three times.

315
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
No, I don't want to.

316
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,500
I'm going to tell her that I was invited by Kurumiya.

317
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Slowly, slowly...

318
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Did you hear that?

319
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Put your tongue out.

320
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
You look good.

321
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Put your tongue out.

322
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Hey, did you really like it that much?

323
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
Put it in your hair.

324
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,500
What was that name again?

325
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
My head is hot.

326
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
Is it getting hot?

327
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,500
That's why I'm like this.

328
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Why are you so nervous?

329
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
What are you doing??

330
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,240
Because of its sharpness

331
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,700
It is in combine

332
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,180
We don't have any chance

333
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,140
Give me!

334
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,300
OK

335
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,300
Where are you going?

336
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,300
Where are you going?

337
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,300
I can't move.

338
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Can't move?

339
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,300
You're going to take off your pants.

340
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
No, I don't want to.

341
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,300
It's hot.

342
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
It's so hot.

343
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,300
You're making me do something.

344
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,300
What's wrong?

345
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,300
Is it here?

346
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,300
No.

347
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
Is it here?

348
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,300
No.

349
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,300
All of them?

350
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
All of them?

351
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,300
It's all right, isn't it?

352
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,300
You're in a good mood, aren't you?

353
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,300
You can't, can you?

354
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,300
You're so excited.

355
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,300
It's obvious, isn't it?

356
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,300
You feel good?

357
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,300
What are you doing?

358
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,300
Look at me.

359
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,300
I'm sorry.

360
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
Yonaru is amazing.

361
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,300
He's so cute.

362
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Shun-chan.

363
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,300
It's okay

364
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
It's okay

365
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,800
It's okay

366
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,800
It's okay

367
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,800
I'm sorry.

368
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Oh, my God.

369
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Do you feel that way?

370
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
Are you crying?

371
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
I'm sorry.

372
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,800
What are you doing?

373
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,800
What are you doing?

374
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,800
Do you feel it?

375
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
I don't feel it.

376
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,800
You're lying.

377
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Why are you shivering?

378
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
I'm not shivering.

379
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,800
You're shivering.

380
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Speak.

381
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Don't be lazy.

382
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
Don't be lazy.

383
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
Do you feel it?

384
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
Be careful.

385
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,800
I'm putting you under the bed.

386
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
I want you to sleep.

387
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
I'm scared.

388
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,800
You don't have to be scared.

389
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
You moved yourself.

390
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
What's the difference?

391
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,800
It's good

392
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,800
It's good

393
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,800
I like it

394
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,800
Are you okay?

395
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Are you scared?

396
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
I'm sorry.

397
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
Go deeper.

398
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,800
Go deeper.

399
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Oh, I see.

400
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,800
Stop.

401
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,800
More.

402
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,800
More.

403
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,800
It feels good.

404
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,800
What is this?

405
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
Help me.

406
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,800
Something's wrong with my body.

407
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,800
I'm not sure.

408
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,800
I'm not sure.

409
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
I'm not sure.

410
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,800
I'm not sure.

411
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,800
I'm not sure.

412
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
I'm not sure.

413
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
I'm not sure.

414
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,800
I'm not sure.

415
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
It's weird.

416
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
Is it weird?

417
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
Really?

418
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,800
Ah!

419
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,800
Ah!

420
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Ah!

421
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Ah!

422
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Ah!

423
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Ah!

424
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
Ah!

425
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
Ah!

426
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
This?

427
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:48,900
Oh.......

428
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,280
You're Armenia

429
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,280
Did you go?

430
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,280
Why are you being told?

431
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,280
It's strange that my stomach is hot.

432
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,280
It feels good, doesn't it?

433
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
I'm sorry.

434
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,280
That's fine.

435
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,280
You'll get even more crazy.

436
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,280
Got it?

437
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
Yeah.

438
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,280
Oh, wow.

439
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,280
You're really relaxed.

440
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
You're smiling.

441
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,280
Are you feeling good?

442
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,280
Feeling good?

443
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,280
Feeling good.

444
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,280
I see.

445
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,280
You're feeling good.

446
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,740
Why did you do that?

447
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,500
Because I saw you cry.

448
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,500
Can't you admit that you made that today?

449
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,760
But you can't say any more.

450
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,400
So, you think I'm better?

451
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,740
What?

452
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,740
You're trying to cry, aren't you?

453
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,740
Come on.

454
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,740
You're crying so much.

455
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,740
You're trying to cry, aren't you?

456
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,740
Come on, come on.

457
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:47,740
It's okay.

458
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,740
It's okay.

459
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,740
I'll take care of you.

460
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,740
I'm going to get you some medicine.

461
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,740
I'm going to get you some medicine.

462
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,740
Open your mouth.

463
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,740
Open your mouth.

464
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,740
Open your mouth.

465
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,740
Open your mouth.

466
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,740
I can't do it anymore.

467
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,740
I can't do it anymore.

468
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,740
This is real sex.

469
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,740
Do you understand?

470
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,740
You can't say anything?

471
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,740
Hey.

472
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,740
It feels good.

473
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,740
It's already in there.

474
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,740
Don't cry.

475
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,740
Don't cry.

476
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,740
Don't cry.

477
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,740
I'm glad you didn't say you didn't want to.

478
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,740
I'm glad.

479
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:48,740
I'm glad you didn't say you didn't want to.

480
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,740
I'm glad.

481
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:27,740
You've decided too much, haven't you?

482
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,740
I'm sorry.

483
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:52,740
You were treated for a second time at that time.

484
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,740
How was it in the second time?

485
01:14:55,740 --> 01:15:02,740
To be honest, I didn't want to do it, but I felt like I had to do it.

486
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:09,740
I see. I'm sorry, it's a little hard to hear, but that means it felt good.

487
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,740
It's embarrassing, but yes.

488
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:20,740
Excuse me, do you usually have sex with your fiancé?

489
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,740
I did.

490
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:26,740
Do you think it's different than that?

491
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:30,740
Yes, it's the first time I've felt that way.

492
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:34,740
Did you end your relationship with Murase?

493
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:40,740
No, even in the middle of the night, his love didn't end.

494
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,740
It's not over yet?

495
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,740
Yes.

496
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,740
Hey, wash your body.

497
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:51,740
Yes.

498
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,740
Hold your breath.

499
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,740
Hold your breath.

500
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,740
Hold your breath.

501
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,740
It's getting bigger and bigger, isn't it?

502
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,740
See?

503
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,740
Your arms are different when you use your boobs.

504
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,740
Relax, relax, relax.

505
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,740
Ah...

506
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,740
Ah...

507
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,740
Ah...

508
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,740
Ah...

509
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,740
Ah...

510
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,740
Ah...

511
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,740
Ah...

512
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,740
Chinako, your shoulders.

513
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,740
Yes.

514
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,740
You can see the shoulders, right?

515
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,740
Yes.

516
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,740
Ah...

517
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,740
Ah...

518
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,740
Do you want to put it on your cheekbone?

519
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,740
Put it on your cheekbone.

520
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,740
Put it on your lower jaw.

521
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,740
That's it.

522
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,740
It feels so good.

523
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,740
Put it on your cheekbone.

524
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,740
How are you feeling?

525
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,740
I'm feeling good.

526
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,740
You don't have to be so nervous.

527
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,740
OK?

528
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,740
OK.

529
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:21,740
Good.

530
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:23,740
Good.

531
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,740
Good.

532
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,740
OK.

533
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,740
OK.

534
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,740
OK.

535
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:38,740
Good.

536
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,740
OK.

537
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,740
Good.

538
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,740
Good.

539
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:49,740
I'm sorry that my family is very sick.

540
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:55,740
I'm sorry that I didn't help you.

541
01:21:56,740 --> 01:22:01,740
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.

542
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:07,740
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.

543
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,740
Are you okay?

544
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,740
Are you okay?

545
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,740
It's okay.

546
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,740
It's okay.

547
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:23,740
Do you like it?

548
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,740
Do you like it?

549
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,740
Are you okay?

550
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,740
Ah...

551
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,740
I just imagined it.

552
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,740
Ah...

553
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:07,740
Ah...

554
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:11,740
Ah...

555
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:14,740
Are you okay?

556
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:18,740
Ah...

557
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:22,740
Are you okay?

558
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:23,740
I'm sorry.

559
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,740
Look at me.

560
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,740
I'm sorry.

561
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,740
I'm sorry.

562
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,740
I want to go to sleep.

563
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,740
Use your hands.

564
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:54,240
No, no, no, no, no, no...

565
01:29:54,240 --> 01:30:01,340
始めよう

566
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:09,240
怖い

567
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,240
You feel good, don't you?

568
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,240
Yes, I do.

569
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,240
Please turn on the lights.

570
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,240
I feel so good.

571
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,240
It feels good.

572
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,240
I feel like I'm going to die.

573
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,240
I feel like I'm going to die.

574
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,240
yam.

575
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,240
He starts to squirm around

576
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:58,080
G According to the

577
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,280
Yes.

578
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:35,280
I'm glad you were able to see Zanami's face.

579
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,280
I'm glad.

580
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,280
Did you put it on the table?

581
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:56,280
No, I didn't.

582
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,280
That's terrible.

583
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,280
And then?

584
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,280
It didn't end until morning.

585
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:21,280
I think he made me feel even more strange.

586
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,280
Even more?

587
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,280
Yes.

588
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:27,280
I was conscious that I shouldn't do it.

589
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,280
But my body didn't listen to me.

590
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,280
It's hard to hear.

591
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,280
Did you think about your fiancé during the process?

592
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,280
I didn't have time to think about him.

593
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,280
It's getting brighter outside.

594
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,280
Open your mouth.

595
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,280
Do you want it?

596
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,280
Oh, medicine.

597
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,280
You're getting better.

598
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:24,280
Do you feel good?

599
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,280
You don't need this, do you?

600
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,280
Shall we play again?

601
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,280
Shall we play again?

602
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,280
Put your hands in front of you.

603
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,280
Ah...

604
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,280
Chica, beep beep beep

605
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,280
Hey

606
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,280
What's wrong?

607
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,280
Chica, you're crying

608
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,280
Ah...

609
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,280
I'm going to stop.

610
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,280
Hey.

611
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,280
I'm going to stop.

612
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,280
Hey.

613
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,280
I'm going to stop.

614
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,280
Yeah.

615
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,280
Open your eyes.

616
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,280
I'm going to play with you.

617
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,280
I'll play with you.

618
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,280
You haven't come in yet.

619
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,280
Are you looking forward to it?

620
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,280
Are you excited?

621
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,280
I'm sorry.

622
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,280
What?

623
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,280
What happened?

624
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,280
What?

625
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,280
What?

626
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,280
I'm sorry.

627
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,280
What's wrong?

628
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,280
Are you okay?

629
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,280
I'm sorry.

630
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,280
I'm sorry.

631
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,280
Ah!

632
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,280
Ah!

633
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,280
Ah!

634
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,280
Ah!

635
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,280
Ah!

636
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,280
I'm going to die.

637
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,280
I'm going to die.

638
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,280
I'm going to die.

639
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,280
I'm going to die.

640
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,280
What's wrong with you?

641
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,280
It's okay, isn't it?

642
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,280
No, no, no.

643
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,100
How are you?

644
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,260
I'm fine.

645
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:37,260
Are you okay?

646
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,260
I'm okay.

647
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,260
You are not sick?

648
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:43,260
I'm fine.

649
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,260
How are you doing?

650
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,260
I'm fine.

651
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:49,260
You are not sick?

652
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:51,260
I'm fine.

653
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,260
Are you okay?

654
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,260
I'm fine.

655
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,260
Are you okay?

656
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:59,260
I'm fine.

657
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:01,260
I'm fine.

658
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,260
I don't want to do it.

659
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,260
I want you to do it more.

660
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:16,260
This is the place you really want me to do it.

661
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:19,260
It's been a long time, isn't it?

662
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:48,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

663
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,260
I'm sorry.

664
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:54,260
I'm sorry.

665
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:08,260
What is this?

666
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,260
What is this?

667
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:15,260
Ai-chan, ai-chan, ai-chan

668
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:22,260
More, more, more

669
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:36,260
It's going to be strange

670
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:39,260
I can't do it anymore.

671
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:47,260
I can't do it anymore.

672
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,260
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

673
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:50,260
It's so hot in here, isn't it?

674
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,260
I can't hear you at all.

675
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,260
It's not like that.

676
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,260
Karashima...

677
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:02,260
Mom...

678
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:02,260
I'm sorry.

679
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:08,260
Are you okay?

680
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,260
You look sad.

681
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:14,260
Are you nervous?

682
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,260
I don't know unless you tell me.

683
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,260
I'm sorry.

684
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,260
You have a boyfriend?

685
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:29,260
I can't help it.

686
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:46,260
Are you making a phone call with your grandmother?

687
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,260
Do you feel good?

688
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,260
Do you feel good?

689
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,260
You're doing your best.

690
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:53,260
You're doing your best.

691
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,260
You're so beautiful.

692
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:28,260
You're so beautiful.

693
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,260
You're so beautiful.

694
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,260
Good boy.

695
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:54,260
Good boy.

696
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,260
You're doing great.

697
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:00,260
You're doing great.

698
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:02,260
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.

699
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:16,260
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.

700
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:20,260
Tofu feels good.

701
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:21,260
What's wrong with you?

702
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,260
What's wrong?

703
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,260
Are you okay?

704
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,260
Please put it in.

705
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,260
Where is it?

706
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:50,260
It's in the corner of my eye.

707
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:52,260
It's not just a corner, is it?

708
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:57,260
Do you want it?

709
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,260
It's from behind.

710
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,260
Come here.

711
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:18,260
You have to come here.

712
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:19,260
Oh, it's hot.

713
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:23,260
Oh, it's hot.

714
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:29,260
It's hot, isn't it?

715
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:31,260
It's okay.

716
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:56,260
I'm sorry.

717
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:59,260
It goes away so quickly.

718
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,260
You're doing it on your own, aren't you?

719
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:10,260
It just goes away when I put it in.

720
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:12,260
Okay, breathe.

721
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,260
No, Ichan!

722
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:31,260
Go, go, go!

723
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:33,260
I'm sorry.

724
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:39,260
You don't remember.

725
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:47,260
Don't move.

726
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:56,260
Are you okay?

727
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:58,260
I'm sorry.

728
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,260
I'm sorry.

729
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:02,260
I'm sorry.

730
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:03,260
Oh, my God.

731
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:28,260
Oh, my God.

732
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:31,260
You've been sleeping like a dog all this time.

733
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:33,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

734
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:35,260
Oh, it really hurts.

735
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:42,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

736
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:47,260
I'm so worried.

737
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,260
Can you hear me?

738
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:03,260
Can you hear me?

739
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:05,260
I can't do it anymore.

740
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,260
I can't do it anymore.

741
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:18,260
Go! Go! Go!

742
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:31,260
You're the only one who can do it.

743
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,620
Huh?

744
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,060
I'm fine.

745
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,540
Ugh...

746
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,440
Ouch.

747
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:16,640
Bad guy...

748
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:18,860
Then why are you 1,000 puedenst?

749
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:50,860
Ouch!

750
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:56,860
Ouch!

751
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:57,860
Help me!

752
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:13,860
More, more, more.

753
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:45,860
It's okay.

754
02:05:45,860 --> 02:05:47,860
It's okay.

755
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:49,860
It's okay.

756
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:29,860
I'm not sure if it's because I'm not used to it, but I'm sure I can do it.

757
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:41,860
I'm not sure if it's because I'm not used to it, but I'm sure I can do it.

758
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:17,860
I thought I had done something wrong.

759
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:24,860
I have a fiance, but I've been threatened by Murase.

760
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:28,860
But I couldn't consult anyone, so I came here.

761
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:32,860
I see. You've done a terrible thing.

762
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:35,860
I appreciate it.

763
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:39,860
It's painful as an emotion.

764
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:41,860
Yes, it's hard.

765
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:46,360
Didn't you tell anyone about this?

766
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,360
No, I didn't.

767
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,360
Your fiancee?

768
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,360
Yes.

769
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:51,360
Your company?

770
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,360
No, I didn't.

771
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,860
Other than that, your family and friends?

772
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:58,360
No, I didn't tell anyone.

773
02:09:58,360 --> 02:09:59,360
You can't tell anyone, right?

774
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,360
Yes.

775
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:05,360
So this is the first time I've heard about this?

776
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:07,360
Yes, this is the first time.

777
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:13,360
Well, if I tell you this, you'll be in trouble, won't you?

778
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:16,360
Of course.

779
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:22,360
You're a woman who won't turn a blind eye to anything.

780
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:29,360
I recorded this.

781
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:33,360
Yes.

782
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,360
Do you know what it means?

783
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,360
What?

784
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:41,360
You came here because you couldn't say no to anyone, right?

785
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:44,360
Yes.

786
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:47,360
If this goes on, you'll have to quit your job, right?

787
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,360
I'm in trouble.

788
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,360
You'll have to cancel your engagement, right?

789
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,360
Yes.

790
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,360
Do you know what it means?

791
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,360
What?

792
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:03,360
You still don't understand?

793
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:12,360
Women get hurt when they're kind.

794
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:17,360
Do you remember this?

795
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:26,360
Hey, Kurimiya-san.

796
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,360
Yes?

797
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,360
Let's drink this and go to Murase.
