1
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:21,430
It's so big.

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,900
I've never been to a hotel this big.

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm a little nervous.

4
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,230
Can I take a look around?

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:39,860
Sure.

6
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:40,861
Let's go.

7
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:08,420
Her name is Mio.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,160
She's a student in my class.

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Half a year ago,

10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,820
I was confessed to by her.

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
When I realized,

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
even though I had a wife,

13
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,480
I crossed the line between
a teacher and a student.

14
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:24,740
I've crossed the line with her.

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,080
I thought, no, I can't do it.

16
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,440
But when she looked at me,

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I lost my mind.

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,160
But I can't keep this relationship forever.

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,370
I'm in my new semester.

20
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,400
I have to tell her today.

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,610
Sensei, thank you for
bringing me to such a nice hotel.

22
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,170
I was very lonely because I couldn't
meet you during the summer vacation.

23
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,030
I'm sorry. I thought I would be suspicious
if I met you until the summer vacation.

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,510
I know. So I was really looking
forward to seeing you today.

25
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,070
How long are you going to stay with me?

26
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,630
I'm going to stay with you forever.

27
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,630
Ishikawa.

28
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,890
Yes?

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,090
I have something important to tell you.

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,170
What is it?

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,050
Is it important?

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,420
Well...

33
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,051
Let's end this relationship.

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
What?

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,660
End? Why?

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Why so suddenly?

37
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,220
I thought about it for a month
when I couldn't see Ishikawa.

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,560
I'm a teacher, and Ishikawa is
a student, and I have a family.

39
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,471
If this relationship is known to
the world, it will be a big deal.

40
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,700
So I think it's better to end this
relationship before it becomes a big deal.

41
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,261
I think it's better for us to break up.

42
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
Sensei...

43
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm really sorry for being so selfish.

44
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,880
But this is for both of us...

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
What?

46
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:18,780
If you want to do that,

47
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
it's okay.

48
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,780
Even if we break up.

49
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,000
But you have a school and a wife.

50
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,191
It'll be bad if they find out.

51
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,580
But is that really okay?

52
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,761
I think you should
think about it a bit more.

53
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,370
Do you like me?

54
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
I love you.

55
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,460
If you still love me,

56
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,580
I'm sure you'll regret
it when you find out.

57
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,630
If you love each other,

58
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,900
you don't have to pretend you don't.

59
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,480
It's been a month since we last met.

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,660
I don't want to break up.

61
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:34,661
I don't want to break up.

62
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,420
We're alone in such a nice hotel.

63
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,480
Teacher, what did you want
to do with me in the hotel?

64
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,520
You want to break up with me, don't you?

65
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,260
Teacher, you really want to
have sex with me, don't you?

66
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:26,920
If it's about you, I'll know right away.

67
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,600
Teacher, I want to have sex with you too.

68
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,584
If you have sex with
me, you don't have to

69
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:54,620
worry about school,
your wife, or anything else.

70
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't care about anything else.

71
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,600
I was only thinking about you
during the summer vacation.

72
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,100
During today's training
ceremony and when I was in class,

73
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,660
I was always thinking
about having sex with you.

74
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,920
I love you.

75
00:07:37,995 --> 00:08:03,570
I love you.

76
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:04,571
Sensei, I love you.

77
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,250
Sensei, say I love you.

78
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I love you.

79
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,810
I love you.

80
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,870
Do you love me?

81
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,270
I love you.

82
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,570
Sensei,

83
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
kiss me.

84
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,470
Sensei,

85
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,790
let's kiss.

86
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,950
Let's kiss.

87
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,530
Why don't you kiss me?

88
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:28,970
Do you still hate me?

89
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
No, I don't hate you.

90
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,330
Then kiss me.

91
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,810
It's been a month since I kissed you.

92
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:52,090
You like kissing, don't you?

93
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,070
Give me a kiss.

94
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,140
I knew you wanted to kiss me.

95
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm happy.

96
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,460
I'll make you forget everything
about school and your wife.

97
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh my god.

98
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,150
Do it a lot, Jin-sei.

99
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,350
A lot.

100
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,920
Can I really do it?

101
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,320
Yes, do it a lot.

102
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Can I lick your hands?

103
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,380
Yes, lick your hands.

104
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,720
I wanted to see you
You wanted to see me?

105
00:15:52,250 --> 00:16:57,450
I want to eat everything.

106
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
Everything.

107
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,740
It's very hot.

108
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,640
It's hot, isn't it?

109
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,826
How long have you been putting up with it?

110
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,380
I've been putting up with it for a month.

111
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,900
It's getting really hot.

112
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,050
You are getting better.

113
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:52,690
You are getting better I
did a lot Are you ready?

114
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,590
Yes, I want you to do it.

115
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,940
He is now in a deep sleep.

116
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,110
He is now in a deep sleep.

117
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,500
I can't stand it.

118
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:40,480
I'm sorry.

119
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,630
I will do what I said.

120
00:19:40,160 --> 00:20:16,520
I want to take it off now.

121
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,100
I don't need it anymore.

122
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:30,500
I want to take it off now.

123
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:34,320
Oh, that's great.

124
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, that's great.

125
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,161
Oh, that's great.

126
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,470
All of it.

127
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,410
All of it.

128
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,430
Do you want me to lick you more?

129
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,170
I want you to lick me more.

130
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,290
Here?

131
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm going to cry.

132
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm going to cry.

133
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:12,770
It's okay.

134
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,390
It's okay.

135
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
Do you want me to do it this time?

136
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,660
I want you to do it.

137
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
A lot.

138
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,960
It feels good.

139
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
It feels good.

140
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,890
I drank it.

141
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,090
No?

142
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,250
I drank it.

143
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,010
I drank it.

144
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,230
I drank it.

145
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,670
I drank it.

146
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,610
I drank it.

147
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,670
You are good at it.

148
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,650
Oh, wow.

149
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,310
Oh, wow.

150
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,670
Does it feel good?

151
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,600
What's going on with your neck?

152
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,570
It's hard, isn't it?

153
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,370
It's hard.

154
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,550
It feels so good.

155
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,770
Like I did.

156
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:42,590
I'm going to give you a lot of it.

157
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,270
A lot?

158
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,980
You're getting bigger, doctor.

159
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,960
I want you to do more.

160
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,350
Really?

161
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,470
Yes, that's right.

162
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,080
Did you endure it, too?

163
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,081
Yes, I did.

164
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,390
I wanted to see you more.

165
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Did you want to see me?

166
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,540
I wanted to see you, too.

167
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,990
It's a kiss on the buttocks.

168
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:58,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

169
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:11,800
Don't you think I'm
getting better at listening??

170
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
You are doing so well.

171
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,740
I watched a lot of videos and studied.

172
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,040
Really?

173
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Yes.

174
00:27:26,755 --> 00:27:36,360
I want you to feel much better.

175
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:39,200
Really?

176
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,180
I feel so good.

177
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,870
Ah... Ah...

178
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,030
Ah...

179
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,150
Which is better, you or me?

180
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,490
You're better.

181
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,210
Really?

182
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,350
You're better.

183
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,190
I'm glad.

184
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,430
Yeah.

185
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Ah...

186
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,870
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah... Is that so?

187
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:55,710
Is it that different?

188
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:21,310
It's so deep.

189
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,600
Oh, it's hard.

190
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:17,320
Wow, you're getting better.

191
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,500
Really?

192
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,400
Did you cry for me?

193
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,220
Yes, I did.

194
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,900
I watched a lot of your videos.

195
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Really?

196
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,570
It feels good.

197
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:50,800
I miss you so much.

198
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,660
Do you miss me?

199
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,020
Yes, I miss you so much.

200
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
I miss you, too.

201
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,080
Doctor, look at me.

202
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:27,360
Doctor, look at me.

203
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,170
It feels so good.

204
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,770
It's very tight.

205
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,490
It feels so good.

206
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,830
Good morning!

207
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:09,810
Good morning.

208
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:10,811
I'm sleepy.

209
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,270
I'm sorry.

210
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,470
I'm sorry.

211
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,370
I'm sorry.

212
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:56,290
I'm sorry.

213
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,170
I can't do it anymore.

214
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:26,450
I can't do it anymore.

215
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,750
Do you want more?

216
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,210
Let me hug you.

217
00:36:38,335 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm going to give you a snack.

218
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:31,170
Yeah, yeah...
It's okay, big bro!

219
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:57,561
I'll be fine I'm sorry.

220
00:38:23,930 --> 00:39:06,460
Are you okay?

221
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:15,400
Are you okay?

222
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,950
Are you okay?

223
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,780
I'm sorry.

224
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,240
It's okay.

225
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,340
I'm sorry.

226
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,820
I want you to hit me hard.

227
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,840
I want you to hit me hard.

228
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,430
It's so hot that I can't stop it.

229
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:40,570
I can't stop it.

230
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,630
I'm sweating.

231
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,030
It's so hot.

232
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,770
I'm sweating a lot.

233
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,650
Is it hot?

234
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,290
Yes, it's hot.

235
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,700
It was a great day.

236
00:41:58,701 --> 00:41:59,701
The weather is amazing.

237
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,260
My waist has moved a lot.

238
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,520
It was a very comfortable day.

239
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,710
Are you in a bad mood all the time?

240
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,470
Do you feel good all the time?

241
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,370
I feel good.

242
00:42:49,815 --> 00:42:51,550
They seem to be getting along well.

243
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,880
I'm glad I can see you, but I'm
scared of what you're going through.

244
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:48,990
I'm not going to be able to see you again.

245
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:49,210
I have a lot of questions.

246
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,730
I thought I couldn't see you.

247
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:57,490
I'm sorry I couldn't see you.

248
00:45:57,491 --> 00:45:59,470
Good boy.

249
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,610
Let me see your back.

250
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
Good boy.

251
00:46:13,155 --> 00:46:14,570
Good boy.

252
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,610
Good boy.

253
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,510
I'm so sleepy.

254
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,830
Great.

255
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,660
I'm so sleepy.

256
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,180
I'm so sleepy.

257
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm so happy.

258
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,820
I'm so happy.

259
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:02,821
I'm so happy.

260
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,380
I'm so happy.

261
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,580
What's wrong?

262
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,910
Oh, my God.

263
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,530
Doctor, can you do that for me?

264
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:34,870
What?

265
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,290
The thing you did for me the other day.

266
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,370
What?

267
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,790
I'll hold your hand.

268
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:45,230
What's wrong?

269
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:40,200
I love you, doctor.

270
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,440
I'm sorry.

271
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,880
I'm sorry.

272
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:39,880
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!

273
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,890
Ahhhh!!!

274
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,470
So scary!!!!

275
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:26,250
Noooooo!!!

276
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:31,190
I can't do anything.

277
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:35,090
Don't do it anymore.

278
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,510
Don't do it anymore.

279
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:37,150
I won't do it anymore.

280
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,850
You don't have to do it anymore.

281
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,490
I'm sorry.

282
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,570
Oh, I'm going to cry.

283
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,410
Oh, I'm going to cry.

284
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:38,510
I'll get you some water.

285
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,880
Thank you.

286
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,130
Thank you.

287
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,030
Can I have some too?

288
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,330
Yes.

289
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,060
You bought me a purse.

290
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You bought me a purse.

291
00:52:20,955 --> 00:52:22,240
I was so excited.

292
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,490
I'll make it clean.

293
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,380
Clean?

294
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,770
It feels good.

295
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:26,150
It's getting hard.

296
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,670
Because you're licking it a lot.

297
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,150
I just took it out.

298
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,831
Sensei, I'm sweating a
lot, so let's go to the shower.

299
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,600
That's right

300
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,100
You're sweating a lot.

301
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:54,700
You're sweating a lot.

302
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,480
Sensei, you're getting harder

303
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,940
It feels good.

304
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,371
I'm full It's amazing.

305
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,030
It's amazing.

306
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
You just did it.

307
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,170
You're good at making a noise.

308
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,170
Really?

309
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,160
It's amazing, isn't it?

310
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,600
Is it okay?

311
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,740
It feels good.

312
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:24,930
It's hard.

313
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,650
Why?

314
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,190
It's very hard.

315
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,410
It feels good.

316
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,280
I'm sorry, I've been
whispering to you all the time.

317
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,642
It's been a long time
since I've been touched

318
00:58:17,654 --> 00:58:20,060
by you, so I'm getting
a good feeling about it.

319
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,480
You're moving a lot.

320
00:58:24,825 --> 00:58:26,226
I'm just touching you a little bit.

321
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
It's not a little bit.

322
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,540
I want to touch you more.

323
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,586
He was in her arms and legs
just as he was about to give birth.

324
00:58:52,610 --> 00:59:07,170
It's a little scary, but
the pain is getting worse.

325
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,490
I think it's the same as before.

326
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,620
He has a lot of pus and it's hard.

327
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,460
I'm rubbing.

328
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,670
Are you rubbing?

329
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,180
I'm rubbing.

330
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,930
I want to rub more.

331
00:59:58,690 --> 00:59:59,690
More.

332
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,770
Rubbing.

333
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,030
Rubbing.

334
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,530
I want to rub.

335
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,250
Here.

336
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,040
Here.

337
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:32,370
From this angle, he is in a good mood.

338
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:51,920
He is looking at the camera.

339
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,320
The camera is displayed on his finger.

340
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,800
I'm going to cry.

341
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,830
I'm going to cry.

342
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:47,831
Are you ready?

343
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,290
I'm so sleepy.

344
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:50,410
Can I sleep?

345
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,650
Yes, you can.

346
01:01:54,790 --> 01:02:01,770
I'm so sleepy.

347
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,290
What's wrong with me?

348
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,110
I don't know.

349
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,850
It's hard, right?

350
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,070
It's hard.

351
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,630
This is the hardest part.

352
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,680
It's hard.

353
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,380
It's hard.

354
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:45,381
It's hard.

355
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,440
Let's do it harder.

356
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,540
Let's do it harder.

357
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm going to try to get him to do it.

358
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:41,600
No, no, no.

359
01:04:43,420 --> 01:05:09,460
You're doing it, right?

360
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:09,620
Yeah, I can't.

361
01:05:09,621 --> 01:05:10,800
I can't, I can't.

362
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,510
OK, OK.

363
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,650
I'm going to put this.

364
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,340
I won't.

365
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,680
OK, I'm going to put this on.

366
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,740
It's not OK.

367
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,280
Yeah, that's right.

368
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,780
I love you.

369
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,700
Love you too.

370
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:23,260
Love you too.

371
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:31,040
Let's go to bed.

372
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:33,500
Let's go to bed.

373
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,940
Bed?

374
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,040
But...

375
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,540
I'm so excited.

376
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,660
I know.

377
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,401
I'm so good at slurping noodles.

378
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,970
Yay!

379
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:35,790
You are so cute.

380
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,420
You are licking me so well.

381
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:13,230
You are licking me so well.

382
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,910
I can't do it.

383
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,690
I'm going to do it here.

384
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:00,790
I'm going to do it here.

385
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,190
I'm going to do it here.

386
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,610
I have a bad feeling about this.

387
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:20,930
I am very nervous.

388
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:21,931
Are you nervous?

389
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:24,310
Look at me.

390
01:09:24,330 --> 01:10:17,610
I feel good.

391
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:19,410
I feel like vomiting.

392
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:21,410
I feel like vomiting.

393
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:02,850
I feel like vomiting.

394
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:10,750
Oh, my God.

395
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,640
It feels good.

396
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Oh, my God.

397
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,500
Oh, my God.

398
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,520
Can I go?

399
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,580
Can I?

400
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,480
Oh, my God.

401
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,880
Oh, my God.

402
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,340
Oh, my God.

403
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,400
Oh, my God.

404
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,630
Sensei, did you poop again?

405
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,510
Why? It felt so good.

406
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:57,120
I didn't mean to poop in the bath.

407
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,860
Was it no good?

408
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,700
No.

409
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,010
I want to spend more time with you.

410
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,970
Me too.

411
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,680
How long are you going to stay like this?

412
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,900
How long are you going to stay like this?

413
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,560
I'm sorry.

414
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,180
I'm sorry.

415
01:19:22,950 --> 01:20:14,240
What's wrong with you?

416
01:20:14,241 --> 01:20:15,441
Doctor, what's wrong with you?

417
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,320
Oh, it's nothing.

418
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,340
Are you pregnant?

419
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,320
What time are you coming back?

420
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,200
Ishikawa.

421
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,420
I don't want to go home.

422
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,260
What?

423
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:46,000
I'm sorry to say this.

424
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:52,560
But I want to be with you more.

425
01:20:53,910 --> 01:21:00,380
I want to stick with you
forever until you go home.

426
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:30,020
I've been wondering
about this for a long time.

427
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,130
Just for now.

428
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:38,090
Can you take it off?

429
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:44,840
No, that's...

430
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,940
Won't you take it off?

431
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,470
I don't have a ring on.

432
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:33,070
You're not my wife now.

433
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,270
Whose is it?

434
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,010
Answer me.

435
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,220
Tell me.

436
01:23:20,765 --> 01:23:21,765
It's Ishikawa's.

437
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:28,440
Sensei, you are mine now.

438
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,520
I'm happy.

439
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,450
Sensei, I want to be with you forever.

440
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,260
Sensei, you are mine.

441
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,090
I'll make you feel better.

442
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:53,230
I want you to like me more.

443
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:16,750
Oh, my God.

444
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,840
Where are you licking?

445
01:26:56,725 --> 01:27:15,970
It's hot.

446
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:19,890
Get well soon.

447
01:27:23,305 --> 01:27:24,305
Forget all the troubles.

448
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:53,730
Ah...

449
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,570
Your body...

450
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:07,650
is delicious.

451
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,070
Really?

452
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:10,950
Ah...

453
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,361
I'm going to lick everything.

454
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:20,020
Because you are mine.

455
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,840
Really?

456
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:35,451
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... I'm sorry.

457
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:44,080
Hey, can I put a kiss mark here?

458
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,900
What? There?

459
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:49,350
Oh, that's gross.

460
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,440
I'm sorry.

461
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,160
Hey, what are you doing?

462
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:00,880
I'm sorry.

463
01:29:00,881 --> 01:29:16,430
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

464
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:18,770
Where are you licking?

465
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:30,150
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

466
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:31,430
Ah, you licked everything.

467
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:33,530
How do you feel?

468
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,750
It feels great.

469
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,990
Ah...

470
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:42,841
Ah... Ah...

471
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,150
Let me see how you feel.

472
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:51,690
Eh?

473
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:54,210
It feels good.

474
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:55,570
It's been good.

475
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:55,950
Yeah.

476
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,190
Ah.

477
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:01,090
Ah...

478
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:02,630
Ah...

479
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,720
Be so absorbed that you
can't think of grass or school.

480
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:27,980
Are you sure?

481
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,480
Oh!

482
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:38,330
I'll make you forget everything.

483
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,546
I'll definitely give it to you.

484
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,570
Really?

485
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:49,940
It's intense.

486
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:58,040
The alcohol is intense.

487
01:31:05,715 --> 01:31:31,080
It's intense.

488
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,200
It's intense.

489
01:31:53,550 --> 01:32:06,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

490
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:11,570
Hmm.

491
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:55,090
Hmm.

492
01:32:56,430 --> 01:33:00,550
Do you feel good?

493
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:01,850
Hmm.

494
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,450
Stay here.

495
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:20,910
It's a cat toy.

496
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:23,870
I thought it was a cat
toy, but it's a toy for cats.

497
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:24,871
I'm so tired.

498
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:26,190
I just want to play with you.

499
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:26,210
I'm having a hard time.

500
01:33:26,211 --> 01:33:27,211
It's a cat toy.

501
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:28,970
This is a toy for cats.

502
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:31,730
I want to play with you, too.

503
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:31,910
Off to sleep.

504
01:33:31,911 --> 01:33:31,950
I can't believe I'm doing this.

505
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:33,090
I want to play with you.

506
01:33:33,091 --> 01:33:34,091
I'm gonna play with you.

507
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,380
I want to go to sleep.

508
01:33:53,381 --> 01:33:53,880
It hurts.

509
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,340
Can you see it?

510
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:26,010
It was really hard.

511
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:29,251
The doctor did it for you.

512
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,480
I'm sorry.

513
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,970
I'm sorry.

514
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:57,070
I'm sorry.

515
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,170
I'm sorry.

516
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:09,090
Oh, wow.

517
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:13,890
Doctor, I love you.

518
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:14,930
I love you, too.

519
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,110
Don't say goodbye to me.

520
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:22,370
I won't.

521
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:24,210
I won't.

522
01:35:24,211 --> 01:35:25,211
I won't.

523
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:30,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

524
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,310
Oh, wow.

525
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:12,260
I'm so sorry...

526
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,461
Great I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry I'm sorry.

527
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,100
I'm sorry.

528
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:12,311
I didn't mean it I'm sorry.

529
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:09,880
I'm sorry.

530
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:54,210
Ah.

531
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,590
Ah.

532
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,590
Aha...

533
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:03,230
How does it feel?

534
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:22,330
Ah.

535
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:23,530
Ah.

536
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:23,890
Ah.

537
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:25,110
Yes.

538
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:26,111
Yes.

539
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,840
Ah.

540
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:42,820
Ha.

541
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,460
Oh.

542
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:57,880
Ah.

543
01:40:57,881 --> 01:40:58,881
Ah.

544
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:00,860
Ah.

545
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:29,450
I'm sorry.

546
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:45,210
I'm sorry.

547
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:46,430
I'm sorry.

548
01:41:54,060 --> 01:42:01,660
Good girl.

549
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:12,950
You look like you're in pain.

550
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:14,110
Really?

551
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:25,780
Oh, my God.

552
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:30,460
I want to relax.

553
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:35,820
Oh, my God. It feels so good.

554
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:41,680
Oh, my God.

555
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:44,680
It feels so good to lick it.

556
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:56,710
Wow.

557
01:44:00,995 --> 01:44:02,630
Can you move?

558
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:04,390
Yes.

559
01:44:06,995 --> 01:44:18,740
It's so soft.

560
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,360
Soft?

561
01:44:29,115 --> 01:44:30,180
Wow.

562
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:33,720
That's amazing.

563
01:44:33,721 --> 01:44:34,721
What's that?

564
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:36,420
Don't call me Ichikawa.

565
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:37,860
What?

566
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,120
Call me Mio.

567
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,960
Mio?

568
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,040
Yes, call me Mio.

569
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,200
Mio is amazing.

570
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,100
Does it feel good?

571
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Yes, it feels good.

572
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,920
Does it feel better than your wife?

573
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:01,760
Yes, it feels good.

574
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,340
It feels good at all.

575
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:34,290
I love you.

576
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:39,310
I love you, too.

577
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,970
I told you to move.

578
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,030
I couldn't stand it.

579
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:09,150
Move more.

580
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:11,290
I want to move.

581
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:12,570
Why?

582
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,400
Does it hurt?

583
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,200
No.

584
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:22,480
Give me a kiss.

585
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:41,550
Do you feel good?

586
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,110
I feel good.

587
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:38,690
You can see it.

588
01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:40,010
I can see it.

589
01:47:40,595 --> 01:47:41,595
It's in here.

590
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:43,550
There are a lot in there.

591
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:45,910
There are a lot in there.

592
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:50,670
Here.

593
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,270
It's not there.

594
01:47:53,271 --> 01:47:54,271
I'm so happy.

595
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:56,890
I'm so happy.

596
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:58,250
Are you happy?

597
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:14,560
I'm so happy.

598
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,040
I love you.

599
01:49:27,850 --> 01:49:28,850
That's great.

600
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,610
Do you want to do more?

601
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,690
I want to do more.

602
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:43,330
Let's do it again.

603
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,750
Can you do it?

604
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,200
Can you?

605
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:49,390
Can you?

606
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,190
I'm sorry.

607
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,510
I'm sorry.

608
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:07,090
I'm sorry.

609
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:10,940
I'm sorry.

610
01:51:10,941 --> 01:51:11,941
I don't want to.

611
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:49,770
It's okay.

612
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:54,210
It's going to be okay.

613
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,230
I'm sorry.

614
01:52:24,231 --> 01:52:25,911
Wow... I'm sorry.

615
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:27,850
I'm sorry.

616
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:13,850
I'm so happy.

617
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:29,920
I'm so happy.

618
01:53:29,921 --> 01:53:31,680
I love you so much.

619
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:33,840
I love you so much.

620
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:49,370
I'm so happy.

621
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,650
I'm so happy.

622
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,780
Hey, doctor.

623
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:23,260
I have a favor to ask.

624
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,060
What is it?

625
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:29,620
I don't want you to go
home to your wife today.

626
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,990
No?

627
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:59,570
I know I'm selfish, but I
want to be with you forever.

628
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,610
No?

629
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:16,550
No.

630
01:56:16,551 --> 01:56:17,551
It's not a problem.

631
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:23,670
I'm happy.

632
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:26,050
I'll be with you forever.

633
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:05,310
I can't stand it yet.

634
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:09,210
Don't do it.

635
01:57:09,211 --> 01:57:10,211
Don't do it.

636
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:12,150
I'm so tired.

637
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:15,430
I'm so tired.

638
01:57:15,431 --> 01:57:16,431
I want to take a nap.

639
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:17,550
Take a nap.

640
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,950
I'm going to die.

641
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:27,950
I'm going to die.

642
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:36,310
I'm sorry.

643
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:38,550
I'm sorry.

644
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,690
I'm sorry.

645
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:54,370
I'm sorry, Sensei.

646
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,890
I love you.

647
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:26,610
Don't go back.

648
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,550
I'll call you.

649
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:38,530
I don't want to.

650
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:41,210
I don't want to.

651
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:43,970
You're my wife, aren't you?

652
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:48,470
I don't want to.

653
01:59:57,340 --> 01:59:59,680
Just think about me.
