1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,440
It's the worst, really.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,030
I was made to wear something weird.

3
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,110
Can you see it?

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,090
Isn't it bad?

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,310
I was told not to take it
off except for the toilet.

6
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,450
It hurts and hard.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,220
I really don't like it.

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,165
But I made a promise
with the producer, the

9
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:57,980
director, and Manu,
so I'm going to keep it.

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,040
I really didn't think I'd be doing this.

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,220
I don't want this. I want to take it.

12
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,980
I wanted to go to the
bathroom, so I'll take it.

13
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:13,981
OK, let's go.

14
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,680
It's difficult, isn't it?

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,960
There is a key on the back.

16
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,240
Do I have to take it off
with this? It's difficult.

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,460
I did it.

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,710


19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,060
You are staring at me.

20
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm not staring at you.

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,060
That's right.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,520
Of course, it's going to be ugly.

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,280
Because it's been on for a long time.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,160
That's right.

25
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,560
When the camera is not running,

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,120
I'm sure you're taking a picture.

27
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,271
Do you think I'm taking a picture?

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Really?

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Do you want to see it?

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Do you want to see it?

31
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,730
You look good in it.

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,050
I told you I like it.

33
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,790
You've been wearing it for a while.

34
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,690
I've been wearing it for a long time.

35
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,490
I want to take it off soon.

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,030
But it looks good on you.

37
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,590
It's quite inconvenient.

38
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,650
I think so.

39
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,030
Did you take it off when you
went to the bathroom? I told you so.

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,870
Thank you.

41
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,810


42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:06,010
I want to shoot in the best condition.

43
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,970
Do you want to shoot? Yes, I do.

44
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,210
It's enough.

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,870


46
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,570
It's OK now, isn't it?

47
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,990
Can I take it
off? It's difficult.

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,870


49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,190
Please take it off.

50
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,870
I can't.

51
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:51,430
Can I take a picture of you?

52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:51,950
Can I take a picture
of you? Yes, please.

53
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,870


54
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,830
I'm going to take a picture of you.

55
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,550
I don't have to take a picture of you.

56
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,130
Don't do that!

57
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,450
I don't want to take a picture of you.

58
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,310
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,850
Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,410
It was like this.

61
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,530
Yes.

62
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:18,710
It was so much that it became like this.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,481
Because I put it on for a long time.

64
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,190
Now, it's in a good mood.

65
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,390
It's in a good mood.

66
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,690
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,090
It's in a good mood.

68
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,410
I can't take it because I'm in a good mood.

69
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,010
I love it.

70
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,310
What is this? Is it okay from the morning?

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Really? You're good.

72
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,470


73
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,110
I heard you like it.

74
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,550
Let's drink it all at once.

75
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,730
Is that okay?

76
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,130
This will make it more erotic.

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,530
Everyone in front of
the camera is also cute.

79
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,490
I'll have it.

80
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,530
What is this?

81
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,791
I don't know what it tastes like.

82
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,170
I don't know what it tastes like.

83
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,930
It's very rich.

84
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,826
You don't know what it
tastes like, do you? I know.

85
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,850


86
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,350
Please drink a little more.

87
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,550
No, I don't know.

88
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:26,010
Isn't there something bad in it?

89
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,550
What? I don't know.

90
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,650


91
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,710
You just took a bite, didn't you?

92
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,270
Maybe it's because I brushed my teeth.

93
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,670
Really?

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,010
But it smells weird.

95
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,510
Is it rotten? Yes, it is.

96
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,030


97
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,790
I think it's rotten.

98
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,290
It must be something bad.

99
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,270
No, it's not rotten.

100
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,510
It's rotten.

101
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,450
It was very expensive.

102
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,370
It's terrible.

103
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,290
It's getting hot.

104
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,970
You're used to drinking expensive alcohol.

105
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,470
I'm not used to it.

106
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,910
Well, that's right.

107
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,930
Is it rotten?

108
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,450
What?

109
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,451
Is it rotten? No, it's not.

110
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,570


111
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,810
It's not rotten.

112
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,350
I put in something that
makes sex more enjoyable.

113
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
What is that?

114
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,510
Is it something you can
tell by the bitterness?

115
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,970
That's different.

116
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:36,750
The smell is different.

117
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
The smell is different.

118
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,970
I enjoy the smell at first.

119
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,190
As expected.

120
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,110
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,850
You look better than before.

122
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,050
What?

123
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,610
You look better.

124
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
It's hot.

125
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,530
Is it hot?

126
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,110
Do you want to start again?

127
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,570
What?

128
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,490
Are you going to
start? Yes, I am.

129
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,990


130
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:16,110
This time, I'm going to start
right away without any preparation.

131
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:19,595
Are you sure? Yes, I am.

132
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,610
Are you going to
start? Yes, I am.

133
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,050


134
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,150
Is it hot over there? It is.

135
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,310
Is it humid? I saw it.

136
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,430


137
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,130
Can you show me how hot it is?

138
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,110
It suddenly became like a music video.

139
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,770
Is it a music video?

140
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,730
What other than a music video?

141
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,490
Do you want to see it?

142
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,510
What?

143
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,470
Do you want to see me there so much?

144
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,270
You are getting excited.

145
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,070
It's a big deal.

146
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,650
Do you understand?

147
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,830
Is it a big deal? It's wet.

148
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,610
It's terrible.

149
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,930


150
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,010
Isn't it? Yes, it is.

151
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,590
It's terrible.

152
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,870
This is.

153
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:13,415
..

154
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,611
Sorry to keep you waiting.

155
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,230
What?

156
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:17,231
I'll be right back.

157
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,350
Really?

158
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,350
It would be a waste if you leave like this.

159
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:15,240
It's terrible if you leave like this.

160
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,210
No!

161
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,550
Why are you doing
this to me? It feels good.

162
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,090
I like it.

163
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:30,630


164
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,810
You don't look comfortable.

165
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,930
Because I haven't
done this for a long time.

166
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,180
How do you feel?

167
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Do you feel warm?

168
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
I feel warm enough.

169
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,720
The inside of my body is hot.

170
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,180
Are you in the best condition?

171
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:22,320
Are you in a good condition?

172
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
I'm in the best condition.

173
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,700
Then let's get started.

174
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,700
Do you want to have sex?

175
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,250
Yes.

176
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
Let's have the best sex.

177
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,020
I wanted to do it from the beginning.

178
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,240
This is the plan for this time.

179
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,200
Bring me here.

180
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,560
I'm coming.

181
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,110
I'm sweating a lot.

182
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,100
Wow, it's getting so hard.

183
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
It's getting so hot.

184
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
It's so hot.

185
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,140
My body is so sticky.

186
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,120
It's been a while.

187
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,380
You want to go out, don't you?

188
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,020
Can I go out? It's a party.

189
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180


190
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:44,930
I'm sweating a lot.

191
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,470
You smell.

192
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,370
Why do you smell? You are happy.

193
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,970
You are wet.

194
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,400


195
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,190
I don't like it.

196
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
Can't I kiss you?

197
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,910
What?

198
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,170
Can't I lick you or
kiss you? Yes, you can.

199
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,270


200
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,540
It's good, isn't it?

201
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm going to sleep now.

202
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,041
You can sleep now.

203
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm going to sleep now.

204
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,540
I feel so good.

205
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,780
I feel so good.

206
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,770
I feel so good.

207
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,210
Give me a hug.

208
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,211
Give me a hug.

209
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,810
Give me a hug.

210
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
I'm sorry.

211
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,356
Do you want to go
in there? I'm going in.

212
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380


213
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,540
From next time, I'll be a never-beat.

214
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm sorry.

215
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,220
I'm sorry.

216
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm sorry.

217
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,360
You have a lot of pimples.

218
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,740
Yes, I have a lot of pimples.

219
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,130
Are you happy? Yes, I am.

220
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,330
It feels good.

221
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,130


222
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,250
I want to do more.

223
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,560
It's scary.

224
00:28:04,530 --> 00:29:32,840
They are playing with each other.

225
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
It's getting heavier.

226
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,360
You are sweating a lot.

227
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,960
You are sweating a lot.

228
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,500
She is calling you.

229
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
She is calling me.

230
00:30:12,001 --> 00:32:23,630
Oh, you are here.

231
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,010
You are so active in the morning.

232
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,430
Because there are three of us.

233
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,790
It's like the last scene, isn't it?

234
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,490
Because it's been a long time.

235
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,590
I don't know if you are
full of sweat or full of spirit.

236
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:45,950
I don't know which one is better.

237
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:46,951
Which one is better?

238
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,010
Which one is worse?

239
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,710
Which one is worse?

240
00:32:59,810 --> 00:32:59,910
Which one is worse?

241
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:00,830
Which one is worse?

242
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:01,831
Which one is worse?

243
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,230
Which one is worse?

244
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,470
Which one is worse?

245
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:22,910
Which one is worse?

246
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:23,910
Which one is worse?

247
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,690
Which one is worse?

248
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,070
Which one is worse?

249
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,050
I'm going to take a shower scene.

250
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,190
It's just a shower.

251
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
What's that? I know.

252
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860


253
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
What?

254
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,920
It's suspicious here.

255
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,360
What?

256
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
What?

257
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,620
What?

258
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,880
I haven't taken a bath yet.

259
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
Please take a bath.

260
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Is there really
nothing? Here we go.

261
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000


262
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Why are you closing it?

263
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Because it hurts! I knew it.

264
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I knew it.

265
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,560
We have a guest.

266
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Please use it.

267
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,560
No, no, we have already taken a bath.

268
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,020
We will help you.

269
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
Is there such a thing?

270
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,160
We have been waiting for you.

271
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,260
What is this? Is it a special time?

272
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,700
You will wash me.

273
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,860
This is the studio.

274
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,980
There is a service like this.

275
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,440
I'm glad to hear that.

276
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,080
Is it a service like that?

277
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,980
I'll make it clean.

278
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,120
Is it OK?

279
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Yes.

280
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,511
You're making a lot of noise.

281
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,300
I'm just washing my hands.

282
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Is that okay? My chest, too.

283
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,420
But you're standing.

284
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
What did you do? Like this.

285
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,070


286
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,700
I'll make it clean.

287
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,160
Thank you.

288
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,760
Let's wash your hair.

289
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:52,280
It's a bit erotic to wash my hair.

290
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Are you ready?

291
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,930
Am I beautiful? I'm ready.

292
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,480


293
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Let's wash your hair.

294
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
Thank you.

295
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,150
I'll wash your back hair.

296
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,330
Thank you.

297
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,990
It's clean here, too.

298
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,210
What's dirty?

299
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,530
I'm sensitive because
I didn't wash my hair.

300
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,430
It's clean.

301
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,770
Thank you.

302
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,990
It's clean.

303
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:55,870
Now that it's clean, let's
move on to the next stage.

304
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,370
What's wrong with
you? It's swollen.

305
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,950


306
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,090
This way, please.

307
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,590
Is it okay if it's
swollen? Yes, it's okay.

308
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,850


309
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,070
What's this?

310
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,590
We've been waiting for you.

311
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:15,591
Thank you very much.

312
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,410
Please make yourself comfortable.

313
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,390
I'll make myself comfortable here.

314
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,830
Thank you.

315
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,150
It's warm.

316
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:26,610
Is it warm?

317
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,850
I was surprised.

318
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,170
How do you feel?

319
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,790
I feel very good.

320
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:37,390
I'll moisturize you.

321
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:38,470
Thank you very much.

322
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:41,510
It's too moisturized,
isn't it? This is good.

323
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,830


324
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,570
Your legs are tired,
aren't they? Yes, they are.

325
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,790
It's new.

326
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,150
I'm so happy.

327
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,151


328
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,270
Let's have a cup of tea.

329
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,230
I'm taking a picture of Chinchin.

330
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,330
Chinchin is massaging you.

331
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,010
Yes, he is massaging everyone's Chinchin.

332
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,950
He is massaging everyone's Chinchin.

333
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:18,390
Massaging.

334
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,010
I'm going to massage a common one.

335
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,030
Massaging.

336
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:45,918
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

337
00:38:45,930 --> 00:39:07,380
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

338
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,610
I'm going to give you a massage.

339
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,940
Are you happy? Yes, I am.

340
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340


341
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,200
There are a lot of pimples.

342
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm going to massage your pimples.

343
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Massage my pimples?

344
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,740
There are a lot of pimples.

345
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,340
How many pimples do you have?

346
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,240
One, two, three, four, five.

347
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Five pimples.

348
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,140
This is a massage for a small baby.

349
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,380
This is a massage for a small baby.

350
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,280
This is a massage for a small baby.

351
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,580
You need a good massage.

352
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,540
You have a lot of hands.

353
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,620
You have a lot of hands.

354
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,240
Saki, you can drink a lot.

355
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
You can drink more.

356
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,800
I feel sick.

357
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
I'm sorry.

358
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,380
I'm sorry.

359
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,180
You are a good girl.

360
00:40:30,485 --> 00:40:31,960
You are a good girl.

361
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:32,961
You are not a big girl.

362
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,160
You are not a big girl.

363
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:35,161
You can open your hips.

364
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,240
You can open your hips.

365
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:42,100
You can open your hips.

366
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:43,960
You have a lot on your face.

367
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:46,500
I'll massage your face.

368
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,140
It's warm, isn't it?

369
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,440
You can give me a massage.

370
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,960
I'll massage your mouth.

371
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,160
Thank you very much.

372
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:08,670
I'll massage your mouth.

373
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,710
Do you feel sleepy?

374
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,390
I'll massage your mouth.

375
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,050
You have a lot on your face.

376
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,850
I'll touch your face.

377
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,350
It feels good.

378
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:25,290
I feel like my heart is melting.

379
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,790
Is it melting inside and outside?

380
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,890
Yes, it's melting inside and outside.

381
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,910
It feels good.

382
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,110
Please don't change your position.

383
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,220
It's about time, isn't
it? I feel so good.

384
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:20,410
I feel so good.

385
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,790
I feel so good.

386
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,810


387
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,460
I want to do something.

388
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,290
How do you feel,
Masaru? I feel good.

389
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,570


390
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,530
I'm glad to have a baby.

391
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,330
I feel good.

392
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,030
I can move my hips.

393
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,870
I'll help you.

394
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,170
I feel good.

395
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,930
I'm sorry.

396
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,550
I'll give you a massage.

397
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,250
My mouth is getting dry.

398
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,630
Your mouth is getting dry.

399
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,550
I'll put this here.

400
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,930
You're giving me a massage.

401
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,330
It's very slippery.

402
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:32,470
I'm going to sleep.

403
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:33,450
I'm going to sleep.

404
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:34,451
Please be careful.

405
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,670
I'm going to sleep.

406
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:51,290
I'm going to sleep.

407
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,840
I'll massage your back.

408
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Thank you.

409
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:33,070
Oh, it's great.

410
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,350
Is it okay?

411
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,990
It's great, isn't it?

412
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,290
Oh, it feels good.

413
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,630
Are you feeling better?

414
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:47,550
Are you okay?

415
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:47,610
Are you okay?

416
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,070
You should be more comfortable.

417
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,790
You should be more comfortable.

418
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,770
Can you do more? I will do more.

419
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,410


420
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,190
You are very patient.

421
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,150
You should be patient.

422
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,910
Are you okay?

423
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,050
You are patient, aren't you?

424
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,550
Ah!

425
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,270
Ah!

426
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:14,250
Ah!

427
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:50,060
I'm sorry I'm not good at explaining,
but the video I'm filming is all the same.

428
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,260
Oh, it hurts.

429
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,150
Oh, it hurts.

430
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,790
Oh, it hurts.

431
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,230
Oh, it hurts.

432
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,530
Do you feel pain now? Yes, I do.

433
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,530
Do you feel pain
now? Oh, it hurts.

434
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,410
I can't do it.

435
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,920


436
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,660
This is the last one.

437
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,560
I can't do it.

438
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,190
Baby is crying.

439
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:20,950
We will fill this up.

440
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:23,910
We will put a lot.

441
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:30,490
Let's fill it up.

442
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:32,010
Let's put a lot.

443
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,730
Yes, a lot.

444
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,650
Look!

445
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,270
Wow!

446
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,470
Wow!

447
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,910
Wow!

448
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,900
You can get into your stomach.

449
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Wow!

450
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,740
Wow! I'm so scared.

451
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,220


452
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,680
It's so slippery.

453
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,160
Chinchin is fine now.

454
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,320
I'm so scared.

455
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,960
I'm sorry.

456
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,530
Let me hold you.

457
00:48:46,955 --> 00:49:04,450
I'm sorry.

458
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,700
I'm so sorry.

459
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,320
I'll hold you.

460
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:33,110
I'm sorry.

461
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,600
Mmm, you are still eating.

462
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,300
Please go in the order.

463
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:56,590
Please go in the order.

464
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,110
That's amazing!

465
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:19,040
You like a fierce play, don't you?

466
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,840
I don't feel good in my
hands… Oh my goodness!

467
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,820
I'm itchy! Itchy! He's coming.

468
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,760
He's coming to you.

469
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,180
He's coming to me.

470
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,280
He's coming to you.

471
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:06,620
You like it.

472
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,140
You like it, don't
you? Yes, I do.

473
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,180
Yes, yes, yes.

474
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,170


475
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,430
Can you climb up?

476
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:20,570
I want to climb up.

477
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,130
Do you want to climb
up? Yes, I want to.

478
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,470


479
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:33,150
Oh, it feels good.

480
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:46,780
I was able to hold Shin-chan.

481
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,700
It's stable, isn't it?

482
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,820
It's comfortable.

483
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,400
I want to touch her more.

484
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,620
I'm sorry I didn't stop you.

485
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:21,960
What's wrong? I'm so sorry.

486
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,860
I'm so sorry.

487
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,380
I'm so sorry.

488
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,960
I'm so sorry.

489
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,741
I can't help it.

490
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,280
I can't help it.

491
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,820
I can't help it.

492
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,700
I can't help it.

493
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,060
I'm sorry.

494
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:55,830
I'm sorry.

495
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:56,831
Look at them.

496
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:57,930
They all fell asleep.

497
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,550
They all fell asleep.

498
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,250
I'm sorry.

499
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,670
I'm sorry.

500
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:13,520
Please come to me.

501
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,900
I'm sorry.

502
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,460
Do you want to go over
there? Yes, yes, yes.

503
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,860
Just like this.

504
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:21,120
Go straight up.

505
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,280
Yes, yes, yes.

506
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,200
Use your body.

507
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:23,620
Go straight up.

508
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,020
Yes, yes, yes.

509
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,100
Go straight up.

510
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,400
It's fun.

511
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:28,401
It's amazing.

512
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,360
Yes, yes, yes.

513
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,240
Yes, yes, yes.

514
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,140
It feels good.

515
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,380
I'll hold you.

516
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,550
I'll hold you.

517
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,050
I'll hold you.

518
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,410
It hurts.

519
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,290
It hurts.

520
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,270


521
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,950
My chest is tight.

522
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,010
Your chest is tight.

523
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,710
My chest is tight.

524
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:31,711
I like you.

525
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,190
Oh, it feels so good.

526
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,300
Good morning.

527
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:46,980
You are very energetic.

528
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,620
Yes, I am.

529
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:43,400
You are strong.

530
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,580
You can do it.

531
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Ahhhhhhh!

532
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:14,200
Put the water in.

533
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,160
Oh! It feels good!

534
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:51,070
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

535
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:52,071
Let's do it together!

536
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:53,470
Ouch!

537
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,170
Ah!

538
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,830
It's a very cold morning.

539
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:30,190
She's now on her back.

540
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,670
I feel like I'm going to puke.

541
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:42,580
What?

542
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,280
It's so uncomfortable.

543
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,321
I'll help you sit on my back.

544
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,120
I'm scared.

545
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,350
【Sleeping and streaming】
I'm going to sleep now.

546
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:16,440
My leg is wet.

547
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:17,760
My leg is wet.

548
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:19,280
I want to sleep more.

549
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,020
I want my leg to be more wet.

550
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,280
I want to sleep more.

551
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,600
I feel so comfortable.

552
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,670
I want my leg to be more wet.

553
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,600
Go, go, go!

554
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:55,880
I want you to put more.

555
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,560
I want more.

556
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,360
Really? You talk a lot.

557
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,100
I'm sleepy.

558
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,010


559
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,540
Is this a lotion?

560
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Or is it a serum? It's a serum.

561
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,580


562
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,260
If I keep putting it in, I'll get a pimple.

563
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,140
I don't know.

564
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,300
It feels good.

565
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,920
I love it.

566
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,480
It feels good.

567
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,040
It's tight.

568
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,780
It feels good.

569
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,710
Give me a massage.

570
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,250
Do you want me to give
you a massage? Yes, please.

571
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:58,690


572
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,690
Give me a massage.

573
01:04:02,691 --> 01:04:02,850
Yes, please.

574
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,470
Yes, please.

575
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:06,950
Yes, please.

576
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:08,590
Yes, please.

577
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,810
Give me a massage.

578
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,170
Yes, please.

579
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,490
Yes, please.

580
01:04:14,491 --> 01:04:15,491
Oh!

581
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,970
Oh!

582
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,050
Oh!

583
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:24,130
Oh!

584
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,131
Oh!

585
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,200
Oh!

586
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:40,560
Oh! I can't move.

587
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:46,560


588
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:01,360
Oh!

589
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Oh!

590
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,780
Are you OK?

591
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,800
Oh!

592
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:11,880
Suddenly?

593
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,120
It hurts when I open my eyes.

594
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,500
Don't use that stupid look on your face.

595
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:00,170
After all, when I eat
rice, it comes back to life.

596
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:07,510
When you eat something with a
lot of energy, you recover quickly.

597
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:09,930
I thought it was weird.

598
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:11,051
I was wondering what it was.

599
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:18,670
There were eels and tails in it.

600
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,430
There was something I don't usually eat.

601
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,880
I knew it was you.

602
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:30,690
Did you think so?

603
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,450
By the way, I prepared
dessert after dinner.

604
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,830
What?

605
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:48,250
Fresh dessert is waiting for you.

606
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,510
Fresh?

607
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,570
Yes.

608
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,530
I think I know what it is.

609
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:53,590
Here you are.

610
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:54,330
Wait! I just ate it.

611
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:55,950


612
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,350
It's waiting for you.

613
01:06:58,790 --> 01:06:59,790
Dessert is important.

614
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,530
I hope it's really a dessert.

615
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:06,670
Here you are.

616
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,050
See, I knew it.

617
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,191
There are a lot of fresh bananas.

618
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:18,850
What are you talking about?

619
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,050
That's how it is.

620
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,590
That's how it is.

621
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,620
It's a lively banana.

622
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:44,830
Can I have some?

623
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:45,831
Can I have some dessert?

624
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,070
Yes.

625
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:53,330
This is a ripe banana.

626
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,070
Does it look
delicious? Yes, it does.

627
01:07:58,590 --> 01:07:59,590


628
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,206
You like bananas,
don't you? Yes, I do.

629
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,890


630
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,670
Please eat a lot.

631
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:08,370
May I?

632
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,670
Wow, it smells so good.

633
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:14,671
It smells good.

634
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,290
Really?

635
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,890
How about this one?

636
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,670
They all smell different.

637
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:26,010
What is it? It's thin.

638
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,050
It smells good.

639
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:38,300
Thank you.

640
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,060


641
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,880
Is it okay?

642
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:50,900
Can I eat this
banana? Of course.

643
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,340


644
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,340
I'm right-handed, so
I'll eat it from the right.

645
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,240
It looks like a banana.

646
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,900
I'll eat it while you drive.

647
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:08,840
Can I eat the left banana?

648
01:09:08,841 --> 01:09:09,841
Are you ready?

649
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,120
You are a lively banana.

650
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:25,830
Let's eat.

651
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,720
It's delicious.

652
01:10:26,205 --> 01:10:27,260
I got a pimple.

653
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,000
I'm touching it all the time.

654
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,800
But it's not coming out.

655
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,510
I can't get it out.

656
01:11:08,285 --> 01:11:11,320
It's time for me to eat, too.

657
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,120
I have never seen such a cute cat before.

658
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:47,790
Mom's hand is in the way.

659
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

660
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:38,660
I'm eating three at a time.

661
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,260
I'm so happy.

662
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Come here.

663
01:12:48,775 --> 01:12:49,980
You eat so well.

664
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,600
I'm so happy.

665
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:52,601
I can't stop smiling.

666
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:05,960
It's delicious.

667
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:16,490
It's great.

668
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:23,030
It's a luxurious dessert.

669
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:33,410
Can I focus on you one
by one? Yes, you can.

670
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:36,390
I'll taste it slowly.

671
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,890
I'll just eat a banana.

672
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,690
Can I eat this
banana? Yes, you can.

673
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,010


674
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,530
Do you like eggs?

675
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:51,531
Do you like eggs? Yes, I do.

676
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,030
It's good.

677
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:55,210


678
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:15,700
You're getting bigger.

679
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,440
Look at my neck.

680
01:14:33,865 --> 01:14:34,980
It feels good.

681
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,280
Really?

682
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,190
I'm going to throw up.

683
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:04,630
Are you going to throw up?

684
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:16,480
I'm going to throw up.

685
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:26,560
Can I kiss you? Then? Next is.

686
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,540


687
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,400
..

688
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,760
Mijibata.

689
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:49,740
Yes, please.

690
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:50,540
May I?

691
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,660
Yes.

692
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,620
I'll put a stone on your back.

693
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,760
It's a bit raw.

694
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:59,410
No, it's not.

695
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,500
I'm sorry for the sound.

696
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,520
It's a weird feeling.

697
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,940
It's a weird feeling, but...

698
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,500
It's a strange feeling.

699
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,540
It's a strange feeling.

700
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,970
I'm a little excited
because I'm licking my lips.

701
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,540
This banana is a little bitter.

702
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,960
Was it bitter? It's delicious.

703
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,220


704
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,680
There is one more.

705
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,280
One more?

706
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,380
May I? This one, too.

707
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,600
Thank you.

708
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,640


709
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:06,870
It's a smooth banana.

710
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,580
It's delicious.

711
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:11,590
My mouth is getting hard.

712
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,660
You can't eat the head, either.

713
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:55,590
Wow! It's so hard.

714
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:10,900
It's so cute.

715
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,440


716
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:53,810
You look like you're going to puke.

717
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,610
Really? It's okay.

718
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,610


719
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,710
I want you to give me a hug.

720
01:21:07,005 --> 01:21:08,286
I want you to put it on my face.

721
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,680
I'm getting ticklish.

722
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:06,970
Can I take it out? Thank you.

723
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:09,830


724
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:17,900
Thank you for the meal.

725
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,100
You feel better, don't
you? Of course I do.

726
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,240


727
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:58,491
This is the end of today's party.

728
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:08,290
Isn't that too much?

729
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,740
Please enjoy yourself.

730
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,500
Wow! Please enjoy it.

731
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,180
I will enjoy it, too.

732
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,420
Wow! There are a lot of hands.

733
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,540
This is a touching bandage.

734
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,000
Your buttocks feel good, don't they?

735
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,240
Your buttocks are white.

736
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:29,240
You have beautiful buttocks.

737
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,340
I'm touching them.

738
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,360
I'm touching them.

739
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,060
I touch it when I want.

740
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:25,020
He is a cat-cat of Saga prefecture, Japan.

741
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:27,060
I'm surprised to see him so much.

742
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,440
He touches everyone.

743
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,680
His hands are full of water.

744
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:41,180
He is looking at me very much.

745
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:51,300
He is looking at me very much.

746
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,960
It hurts.

747
01:27:13,961 --> 01:27:31,730
I'm crying.

748
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:47,460
I'm crying.

749
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:48,621
I won't stop even if you cry.

750
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,940
I feel bad.

751
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,150
I'm sorry.

752
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:16,290
Do you want me to
hold you? One, two.

753
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,750
I'm so happy.

754
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:25,390


755
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:29,050
You lick it in order.

756
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:44,600
Do you feel good?

757
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,340
I feel good, but...

758
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,140
You are drooling.

759
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:14,730
Good boy.

760
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:15,731
You are a good boy.

761
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:34,270
Now, here is your new toy.

762
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:36,330
He is a good boy.

763
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,370
Here is your new toy.

764
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:37,950
Now, you can play with him.

765
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:42,390
He will come in.

766
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,220
Oh, no!

767
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:47,540
What's wrong? My butt hurts.

768
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,320
My mouth hurts.

769
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,360


770
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,040
Does your mouth hurt?

771
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,320
Yes.

772
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,980
How do you want
me to lick you? Here.

773
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:00,800


774
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,120
Here?

775
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,760
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a cute baby.

776
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:42,440
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

777
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:43,340
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a cute baby.

778
01:30:43,341 --> 01:30:44,901
I'm glad I was able to film this video.

779
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,940
You are amazing.

780
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:42,280
I can't stop crying.

781
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,540
I'm so happy.

782
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,660
Let's go to drink your favorite drink.

783
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:17,020
I'm going to take you out.

784
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,040
I'm going to surround you.

785
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,160
There are a lot of Tenko.

786
01:32:42,335 --> 01:32:59,941
This is a video of my
son and my daughter

787
01:32:59,953 --> 01:33:19,720
playing with my son's
favorite toy, a cat toy.

788
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:26,320
He is cute and gentle, but
he has a hard time sleeping.

789
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,230
Chin-chin's first time
eating Poco-chan's pizza?

790
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:12,890
Poco-chan wants to play with him.

791
01:34:12,891 --> 01:34:16,230
Toto wants to play with him.

792
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:24,910
Poco-chan is a little quick
to draw attention on him.

793
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,050
Are you sleepy? I'm sleepy.

794
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:28,090
You're sleepy.

795
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,590


796
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,450
Does it feel good? I'm sleepy.

797
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,770


798
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,110
Is it good? I'm sleepy.

799
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,720
I'm sleepy.

800
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:04,480


801
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:24,400
Haru-chan is a good boy, but
he is not good at playing with toys.

802
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,376
He is a little bit timid
and a little bit clumsy.

803
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,360
He is a little bit timid
and a little bit clumsy.

804
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,560
But he is a good boy.

805
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:47,040
He is a little bit timid
and a little bit clumsy.

806
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:13,800
Other than the fact that I had
a good time with my husband,

807
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:13,820
I was able to spend quality
time with my daughter.

808
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:15,416
I was able to spend quality
time with my daughter.

809
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,940
I don't want to eat.

810
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,300
I don't want to eat.

811
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:23,880
You don't want to eat?

812
01:36:23,881 --> 01:36:25,380
I don't want to eat.

813
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,360
I will lick you.

814
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:31,720
Will you lick me? Yes, I will.

815
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,360
No, no.

816
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,540
No? Not yet.

817
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,060
It's coming.

818
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,300


819
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,520


820
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,380
I was able to line up.

821
01:36:52,840 --> 01:37:15,480
I move this, too.

822
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,660
This is not the way.

823
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:40,760
This is the order.

824
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,080
This is the order.

825
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,040
I don't want to get up.

826
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:42,330
Please try to get up.

827
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,150
Please try to get up.

828
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:47,310
Where? I'm behind you.

829
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:49,570
Look.

830
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:51,290


831
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:44,630
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby crying like this.

832
01:39:44,631 --> 01:39:44,830
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

833
01:39:44,831 --> 01:39:44,950
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

834
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:47,650
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

835
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:49,750
I was surprised to see
a baby crying like this.

836
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:01,390
I'm sorry.

837
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,470
I'm so sorry.

838
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:11,950
I'm sorry.

839
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,250
Turn this way.

840
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:15,130
Turn this way.

841
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:53,620
Put your head on my lap.

842
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,560
Oh my gosh!

843
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Wow!

844
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:06,780
It feels great!

845
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:29,470
Come on, let's go to bed.

846
01:41:29,471 --> 01:41:30,590
Tama-chan, you can do it.

847
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:06,580
I'm scared.

848
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:15,080
I want a tampon, but I can't find it.

849
01:42:15,081 --> 01:43:10,370
She is very popular.

850
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:02,420
I'm sorry.

851
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,420
I'm sorry.

852
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,090
I'm sorry.

853
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:00,091
Did you call me? Yes, I did.

854
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:01,630
I'm sorry.

855
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:15,750
I'm sorry.

856
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,560
I'm sorry.

857
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,980


858
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:14,140
I'm going to give you a massage.

859
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,340
I'm going to give you a massage.

860
01:46:58,430 --> 01:46:59,430
Are you tired?

861
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:18,030
Are you tired?

862
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,250
Are you tired?

863
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:26,050
I'm so scared!

864
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:27,130
I'm scared!

865
01:47:27,131 --> 01:47:28,131
Where are you going?

866
01:47:38,600 --> 01:49:01,480
You can't go far if you move a lot.

867
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:06,030
I want you to do more.

868
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:08,940
I want to do more.

869
01:50:08,941 --> 01:50:09,941
I'm tired.

870
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:17,400
I'm tired.

871
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:20,560
I'm tired.

872
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:32,680
I'm tired.

873
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:45,130
This is a video of a baby
who was taken to the hospital.

874
01:53:45,131 --> 01:53:47,450
I was so happy that I
couldn't help but cry.

875
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:57,190
A baby is crying and having a hard time.

876
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:00,210
The baby is crying and having a hard time.

877
01:54:00,211 --> 01:54:01,670
Oh, it feels good.

878
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:07,470
Oh, it feels good.

879
01:55:43,650 --> 01:56:30,070
Are you OK?

880
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,040
Are you OK?

881
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:46,920
I'm very satisfied.

882
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:56,560
Are you okay?

883
01:56:58,460 --> 01:56:59,600
Do you feel better?
I just woke up.

884
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,180


885
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,380
You didn't move, did you?

886
01:57:08,675 --> 01:57:09,780
Please wake me up.

887
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,171
You must have exercised so hard.

888
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:13,860
That's right.

889
01:57:16,010 --> 01:57:17,251
You slept for about 30 minutes.

890
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,520
30 minutes? It was amazing.

891
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:19,820
It was amazing.

892
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:21,400


893
01:57:21,550 --> 01:57:27,070
It's been a while since
I've done it so hard.

894
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:31,980
I'm still a baby.

895
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:37,700
Do you still want to do it?

896
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:41,880
I can still do it.

897
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:47,720
Do you want to do it again next month?

898
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,520
Do you want to increase
the number of people?

899
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,160
OK.

900
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:55,460
How was it?

901
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:59,360
It's the best day of my life.

902
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,600
Makeup time?

903
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:07,930
You can put it on.

904
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:09,890
Are you sure?

905
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:12,210
I don't want to.
