1
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,590
What?

2
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,270
I knew it.

3
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,410
Are you Noc?

4
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,190
Yes, I am.

5
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,230
I remember you.

6
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,150
We talked about Scottish
Fold at the grass baseball game.

7
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,590
I know you.

8
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,031
I'm shopping at a convenience store.

9
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,450
I think you look like him.

10
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,180
It's a little far.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,840
I live nearby.

12
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
Is that so?

13
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,500
Are you going home today?

14
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,501
Yes, that's right.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:23,940
You don't have a job?

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,120
No, I don't.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,740
Oh, I see.

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,680
Oh, I see.

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
I see.

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,260
I see.

21
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,320
I see.

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,260
I see.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,900
I see.

24
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,180
I see.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,760
I see.

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
I see.

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,830
I see.

28
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,395
If you want, I can take a
picture of your face for your

29
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:56,030
wife if you give birth to
a child in the first priority.

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,150
But I'm really okay today.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,510
You can just look at my face.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,950
Please pet me.

33
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,090
Really?

34
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,310
I just saw you a little.

35
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,990
It's a coincidence, isn't it?

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,490
It's not easy.

37
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,250
Really?

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,890
He's here.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
Good morning.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,890
Good morning.

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,670
It's cold.

42
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,270
It's cold.

43
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:05,910
Thank you.

44
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:06,911
Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,551
I'm director Takahashi, and
I'll play your husband today.

46
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,650
I'm Takahashi.

47
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,750
I'm Chihiro.

48
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,190
You're cute.

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,150
I don't need that this time.

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,950
It's not a collaboration,
so I don't need that.

51
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,006
Is there anyone else who has
nothing to do with Mr. Karaki?

52
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,590
The person I took on a
double-Decker trip with is him.

53
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,650
He's beautiful, isn't he?

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,970
From this moment on, please don't
hold back because he's your real husband.

55
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,930
I got it. I'll do my best.

56
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,450
I don't have to hold back, do I?

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,510
I think you don't have to.

58
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,490
Don't overdo it.

59
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,110
Don't hold back.

60
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,590
Don't hold back.

61
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:55,587
Actually, I want you to
kiss me right now, but if your

62
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,830
partner finds out about
it, I think your plan will fail.

63
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,230
Anyway, it's your mission to
make me look like a real couple.

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,510
And I want you to get
along with your husband.

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,670
She is a bit weak.

66
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,350
I want her to get along with Inoue-San.

67
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,290
I want her not to be like that.

68
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,550
And I want her to make
the target's wife jealous.

69
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,410
I want her to flirt with the target's wife.

70
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,451
It's just right, isn't it?

71
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,530
I wonder if it's okay.

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,330
You're good at spoiling.

73
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,291
I'm so nervous that my
partner's wife is nervous.

74
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,750
I wonder if it's okay.

75
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,110
Are you okay?

76
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,130
I don't care about your age.

77
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,690
I don't care about your marriage history.

78
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,350
I don't know how old I am.

79
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,210
Didn't you see the e-mail I sent you?

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
What was it?

81
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,770
You didn't see it, did you?

82
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,350
I put it at the end.

83
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,670
Have you seen it?

84
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,010
I don't know.

85
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,650
Was there such a thing?

86
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,890
I think a little over 10 years is fine.

87
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,470
She is in her 30s now.

88
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,890
Isn't it about 10 years?

89
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,150
I got married when I was 22 years old.

90
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,210
I think it's about 10 years.

91
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,730
It may be better not
to give a clear answer.

92
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,210
I don't have a child.

93
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,930
Oh, like a boss?

94
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,330
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

95
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,750
You can take care of your wife naturally.

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,370
If you flirt a little too much,

97
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,790
I think you're doing your
best for your husband's job.

98
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,850
I'm totally fine.

99
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,150
Yes, I did.

100
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,230
No, but it's nice to wear glasses.

101
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,290
Really?

102
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,370
It looks good on you.

103
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,150
Really, really, really.

104
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:52,790
From the morning.

105
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,530
Please don't be in the usual tone.

106
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,530
No, because the glasses look great on you.

107
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,010
I have a great glasses face.

108
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:58,950
Oh, is that so?

109
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,951
Oh, I see.

110
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,010
It's about time.

111
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,910
This time, I'm going to take care
of the staff and one more person.

112
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,330
I see.

113
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,130
Thank you.

114
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,910
Abe-chan quit.

115
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:12,830
Oh, really?

116
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,730
Karaki-San will do that again.

117
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,430
I saw it the other day.

118
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,810
What are you doing at work?

119
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,750
I was told not to take the female staff.

120
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,890
Of course.

121
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,470
I'm the only man.

122
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:34,229
I don't know why, but I was having sex with a lady
while I was working, so I'm concentrating this

123
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:41,770
time, so I can't make a mistake because there
are only men, so I'm scared if I make a mistake.

124
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:41,830
I don't want to see it.

125
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,410
It's OK.

126
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,470
No?

127
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,430
You look sexy.

128
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,990
Are you OK?

129
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,310
Yes.

130
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,390
I can't get in touch with
you until we get in the inn.

131
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,310
Please be a couple.

132
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,910
Thank you.

133
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,530
Thank you.

134
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,531
It's about time.

135
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,770
Thank you.

136
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,370
Thank you.

137
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,371
Let's hold hands.

138
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,270
It's warm, isn't it?

139
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,070
It looks fun.

140
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
There it is.

141
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:54,000
The car is square.

142
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,120
Take a picture.

143
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,090
I can't get any closer.

144
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,770
It's coming from here.

145
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,430
Mofu-San.

146
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,610
You're smiling.

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,510
I'm looking over here, so be careful.

148
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,470
There's a smoke.

149
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,010
I got it.

150
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,410
Is the photo okay?

151
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,470
Yes, it is.

152
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,930
Start the engine.

153
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,310
Turn on the engine
and put on the seat belt.

154
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,230
The other car is coming.

155
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,870
I can't find the pin.

156
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,990
It's coming.

157
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,010
Go straight ahead and don't
let the traffic light catch you.

158
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,330
Go straight ahead.

159
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:57,890
Go straight ahead.

160
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,610
You are young.

161
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,290
We are 30 years old.

162
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,450
Really?

163
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,490
My husband's skin is very beautiful.

164
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,230
Your wife is also very
beautiful, as rumored.

165
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:21,930
Rumor?

166
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,830
It's nice to be young.

167
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,030
I don't think I'm young.

168
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,210
How is it?

169
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:39,190
You look good in glasses.

170
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,330
Really? Thank you.

171
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,630
I'm glad to hear that.

172
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,070
I'm glad to hear that.

173
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,810
Thank you.

174
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,800
How old are you?

175
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,060
How old are you?

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,300
5 years old.

177
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
5 years old!

178
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,980
That's great.

179
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
It's tough.

180
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,980
We don't have kids yet.

181
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh, I see.

182
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
That's right.

183
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm 6 years old this year.

184
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,920
So, you met when you were in your 20s?

185
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:46,480
Yes, I met her when I was in my 20s.

186
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,280
Where did you meet your wife?

187
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,420
I used to play baseball.

188
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,560
Oh, you did?

189
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,300
Yes, when I was in college.

190
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,520
It was like a club.

191
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,020
My wife came to see me play.

192
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,060
Yes, that's right.

193
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,000
You came to see her?

194
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,980
Yes.

195
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,720
Did you know each other at that time?

196
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Yes.

197
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,060
Did you talk to her?

198
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,840
I was a little curious.

199
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Because there is a cute girl.

200
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,220
Such a beautiful person.

201
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I talked to her.

202
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
How long have you been
married to Takahashi-San?

203
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,720
How many years?

204
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,300
About 10 years.

205
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:34,920
Is that so?

206
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,020
Yes.

207
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,720
I see.

208
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,920
It's been 10 years.

209
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
Time flies.

210
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Time flies.

211
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,740
So you got married as soon as
you graduated from university?

212
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,461
Well... Well... Well... 25?

213
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,260
24.

214
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,620
24?

215
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:01,880
Yes.

216
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,881
I see.

217
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,660
So, when you graduate
and get a job in a company,

218
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,620
you'll feel safe, right?

219
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,520
Yes.

220
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,721
When you get used to your job.

221
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Yes.

222
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Oh, I'm going in front.

223
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,140
So, where did you take your child today?

224
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,480
Today, I happened to take
him to my family's house.

225
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:30,481
Oh, really?

226
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,420
I was able to take care of it.

227
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,630
You've never had a date with your
wife since you were a kid, have you?

228
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,010
No, I haven't.

229
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,030
Sometimes I take care of it at home.

230
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,910
I've had a lot of dates.

231
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,310
I remember a little.

232
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,410
That's pretty much the
case when you're a kid.

233
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,010
Oh, that's right.

234
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:56,011
Yes, it is.

235
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,330
Shift the dial to the maximum.

236
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,500
I can't see you.

237
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I can't see your face.

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,980
Do you go on a trip together?

239
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,760
We don't go on a trip much.

240
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,860
Because you are still young?

241
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,460
We used to go on a trip
before we had a baby.

242
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,260
We went to the hot spring.

243
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,040
We go to the hot spring.

244
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:53,480
The hot spring is really good
The yukata is fresh I'm thrilled.

245
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,120
I often go on a trip with my wife.

246
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't have children, so I often
go to the sea or the mountains.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,820
I often show 50% of the
beauty of a woman's yukata.

248
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,140
Is that so much?

249
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:19,320
I think you look good in a yukata.

250
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Really?

251
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:28,920
I'm so happy I'm
worried What should I do?

252
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:41,380
I think you look good
too I want to see Yes, it is.

253
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,620
It's at low speed, isn't it?

254
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
What?

255
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,700
It's not a driving, it's at low speed.

256
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,020
You.

257
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,760
Really? I didn't notice.

258
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,560
I thought the engine sound
was too loud, but it's at low speed.

259
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,376
It's been running at
low speed all the time.

260
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,660
All the time?

261
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,400
The engine will burn out.

262
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,560
Are you OK?

263
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
I didn't notice.

264
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,980
Today, the upper body is naked.

265
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,760
I'm not interested in it.

266
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,161
You don't want to see it that much.

267
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,900
I'm not interested in it.

268
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm not interested in it.

269
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm not interested in it.

270
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,100
You just want to see it.

271
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,140
No, I don't.

272
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,480
I don't want to see a man's skin.

273
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
No, I don't.

274
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,080
The shoulder width is wide.

275
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,000
It's because it's baked.

276
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
It's solid.

277
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,740
It's manly.

278
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
I'm jealous.

279
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,340
I'm so happy to participate.

280
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,521
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

281
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,020
It may be close to a five-year divorce.

282
00:16:51,980 --> 00:17:02,421
No, no, no If so, I'll take care of my
wife I see Let's exchange Let's go.

283
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,180
You've been here for
10 years, so it's fine.

284
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,120
It's coming.

285
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I was surprised.

286
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,620
It's so fast.

287
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,740
Don't let it go.

288
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,741
Follow me.

289
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,680
I couldn't catch up with you if I was slow.

290
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,040
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,400
The engine was on fire and it exploded.

292
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,020
What are your hobbies?

293
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Hobbies?

294
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,440
I like to go to hot Springs.

295
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,040
I like cats.

296
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,300
Do you have a cat?

297
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,380
A cat is biting a cat.

298
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,780
A cat is biting a cat, isn't it?

299
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,520
A cat is biting a cat, isn't it?

300
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,160
I want to buy a pet.

301
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,740
I want to buy a pet.

302
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,280
I heard that many
children want to buy a pet.

303
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,940
I want to buy a pet.

304
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,536
Usually, you buy a pet instead of a child.

305
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
That's right.

306
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,580
It's good.

307
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,800
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

308
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,440
Good, good, good, good.

309
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,290
No, no.

310
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,958
I'm in front of my husband,
but when did you fall

311
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,570
in love for the first time
and become a wife?

312
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,170
I thought I'd ask you, but
I'm a high school student.

313
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,710
I'm a high school student.

314
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,830
What grade are you in high school?

315
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,450
I'm in the second year of high school.

316
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,170
How old were you in high school?

317
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,770
About 16 How old are
you? I'm 16 years old.

318
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,710
Are you in the same class? Yes.

319
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,950
What made you start dating?

320
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,810
It's not like we started
dating, but it just happened.

321
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,630
It's close Was the seat close?

322
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,450
There is also that
The same class.

323
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:07,941
Gentle feeling I was doing it I was
playing soccer Did you play soccer?

324
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,650
Where did you go on a date when
you were a high school student?

325
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:29,870
You can hear it well You can hear
it well Karaoke Karaoke in that era?

326
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:46,340
Movies Do you practice
together after club activities?

327
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
That's right.

328
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,260
Great It's been a long
time since I've seen you.

329
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,941
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

330
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,440
I feel like I'm a detective.

331
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,200
I want to see your wife's face,
but I don't think I can see it.

332
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm curious about your wife's expression.

333
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,261
I'm curious what he is doing.

334
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,600
I got a message from my
mother saying happy birthday.

335
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,300
I got a shock.

336
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,360
Put the steering wheel
on the steering wheel.

337
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,600
Put it on carefully.

338
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,770
I have no choice but to go ahead.

339
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:43,810
Oh, I think it's good.

340
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,606
Oh, it's not good right behind.

341
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,630
It's a little over there.

342
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,910
Two of them are about there.

343
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,850
Oh, one more.

344
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,170
It's okay here.

345
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,650
It's coming, it's coming,
it's coming, it's coming.

346
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,890
Aim, aim, aim.

347
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,430
I don't look at the camera much.

348
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,570
Under the window.

349
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,910
I'm looking at the situation.

350
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,170
Mr. Aoki, are you all right?

351
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,830
I can't see this way.

352
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,130
It's just a square.

353
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,030
All right, I'll go, too.

354
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:15,031
I'll leave it in the car.

355
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,710
Thank you.

356
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Are you okay?

357
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Are you drunk?

358
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
I'm fine.

359
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
My husband is used to it.

361
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,020
No, no, no.

362
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
It's no big deal.

363
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,520
My wife is happy, too.

364
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,180
She's rarely praised today.

365
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,720
Thank you.

366
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
No, no.

367
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,530
I'm a salesman, so I feel good.

368
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,560
It's a little further
from here, so if you're

369
00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:50,020
going to the bathroom,
you should go ahead.

370
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,540
It's coming, it's coming, it's
coming, it's coming, it's coming.

371
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,360
Let's take a look at the inside of the car.

372
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,761
Please turn your head to the front.

373
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,560
If you turn your head too
much, you will be suspicious.

374
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:25,830
Please turn your head to the front.

375
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,170
Please turn your head to the front.

376
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,190
Are you okay?

377
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,530
Please enter the entrance of the car.

378
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
It's amazing.

379
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,740
Mr. Inoue and Mr. Chihiro are escorting.

380
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:49,660
He is escorting by hand.

381
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Great! Great!

382
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,820
It's as planned.

383
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,240
He is coming.

384
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,040
Great! Great!

385
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
As planned.

386
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Welcome.

387
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
He is coming.

388
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,700
Let's go.

389
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
Let's go.

390
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Please.

391
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,370
Oh, come on in.

392
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Welcome.

393
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,600
Oh, I'm here to take a look around.

394
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,380
This is the kitchen.

395
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,600
This is the kitchen.

396
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:17,100
You can actually use this.

397
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
You can use it like this.

398
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I'll do it.

399
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,900
I'll do it.

400
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Why?

401
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,680
Why are you doing this?

402
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,580
Stupid.

403
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
I'll do it.

404
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,900
Where are the sweets?

405
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,740
It's open.

406
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,720
Take off your shoes.

407
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,530
Here it is.

408
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,750
Thank you for it.

409
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:17,751
Itadakimasu.

410
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,500
When it gets cold, we
don't come here often.

411
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
That's right.

412
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,820
We come here when it's warm or in summer.

413
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,460
But we don't come here often in winter.

414
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,320
It's a little cold.

415
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
That's right.

416
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,430
I'll put the heater on.

417
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
It's a little calm.

418
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:46,300
Is that so?

419
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:47,920
It's like I'm in my parents' house.

420
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,560
Today, I'm going to use this
color and put a button here.

421
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,240
Oh, I see.

422
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,241
This is a button.

423
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Everyone is cute.

424
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,840
It's a holiday.

425
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,590
Please eat a lot.

426
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,920
I'm a little hungry.

427
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,840
Haru-chan, please tie it up there.

428
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
I'm sorry.

429
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,900
Haru-chan, please tie it up there.

430
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

431
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
Why are you two there?

432
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,860
I was surprised.

433
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,620
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:30,621
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm sorry.

439
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,980
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,120
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:38,121
I want to give it to you.

443
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Thank you very much.

444
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,420
I'm glad to hear that.

445
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
Please take it easy.

446
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,810
I'm not sure.

447
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,510
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:52,960
It's tough, isn't it?

449
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
It's a little tough.

450
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,880
It's nice to do this.

451
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,720
If you live in the city on a daily basis,

452
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,220
you have to change your mood.

453
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,120
I'm sure you'll get a lot of comments.

454
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,580
I'm sure you'll be surprised.

455
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,740
Was it a mansion?

456
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
It's a mansion now.

457
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,200
It's a mansion, so there's no garden.

458
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's right.

459
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,820
You can have a barbecue over there.

460
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,780
It's a little bit.

461
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:34,900
I am going to take a bath.

462
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't like it.

463
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,440
Do you have a toilet or something?

464
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,700
That's right.

465
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,020
After taking a bath, you can drink a beer.

466
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
It's ideal.

467
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,000
From now on,

468
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,040
we will prepare a hot spring.

469
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,660
We are going to prepare a hot spring.

470
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:01,781
I'll prepare a seat for you.

471
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
Oh, really?

472
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,770
When you enter,

473
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,370
first, you can sit in the lady first.

474
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,500
Oh, that's great!

475
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,040
You can sit in the lady's seat.

476
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,220
Then, I'll follow your words.

477
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
It's a good room.

478
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
This is it.

479
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,640
It's a good room.

480
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,280
It's a room that can fit four people.

481
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
It's big.

482
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,120
Which one fits?

483
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm sorry that I couldn't see it.

484
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,760
Ahaha.

485
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Ahaha.

486
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Well then, Haruna.

487
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,240
Put it up like this and prepare a bath tub.

488
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Oh, I see.

489
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,220
Well then, the two of
you will prepare a bath.

490
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,620
Oh.

491
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,840
I'll prepare it over there.

492
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,780
Ah, I see.

493
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Please.

494
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
Oh, like this.

495
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,850
Yes, please.

496
00:30:58,851 --> 00:30:59,070
Let's go.

497
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,450
I'll get ready.

498
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,210
Thank you.

499
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,630
This way.

500
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:06,910
Please.

501
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,630
Thank you.

502
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,670
I'll get ready.

503
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,070
Please take your time.

504
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,690
Thank you.

505
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,310
It's a nice room.

506
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,910
The previous room was not good.

507
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,070
What?

508
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,491
But... He's flirting
with his wife.

509
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,710
He's flirting with her.

510
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,730
I'm sure he's in a bad mood.

511
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,530
But he looks happy.

512
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,050
No, he's not.

513
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,490
What?

514
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,290
That's not good, Takahashi-San.

515
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,770
Maybe he's in a bad mood.

516
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,810
I don't think so.

517
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,810
But he looks like he's in a bad mood.

518
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,630
He's in a daze.

519
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,830
Hey.

520
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,370
What?

521
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:02,371
It's okay.

522
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,030
You haven't gone to bed yet.

523
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,550
I can hear your voice.

524
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,450
It's okay.

525
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,070
You don't have to speak out loud.

526
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,110
You're sleepy, aren't you?

527
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,430
You're sleepy, aren't you?

528
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,370
You're sleepy, aren't you?

529
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:17,411
You're sleepy, aren't you?

530
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:36,560
You haven't slept yet.

531
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:37,561
You haven't slept yet.

532
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,600
You might want to do something.

533
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,251
Then... It's okay.

534
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,410
It's fine.

535
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,570
It's just a little bit.

536
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,830
It's okay.

537
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,750
It's fine.

538
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,590
It's okay.

539
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,950
We came here together.

540
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,870
I'm afraid my voice will be recorded.

541
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,010
It's okay.

542
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,890
I'm still preparing.

543
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,710
I see.

544
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:39,810
It's okay.

545
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:43,470
I'm going to take this off.

546
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,770
It's okay. He won't come back.

547
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,730
Come here.

548
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,050
It's wet.

549
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,730
Are you okay?

550
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:17,731
It's okay, right?

551
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,090
Since you're our nurse,

552
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,550
don't do anything unprofessional.

553
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,590
No way.

554
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,430
It's okay.

555
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,690
I don't want to.

556
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,790
I'm so happy to have you together.

557
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
No.

558
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,270
It's okay.

559
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,410
I don't want to.

560
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,650
It's okay.

561
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,710
I'll put you in.

562
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:08,100
Kizu's heading to the bedroom.

563
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,360
Ah, yes, I'm coming.

564
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:09,361
Ah, Mrs. Nakajima.

565
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,860
Are you ready?

566
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,780
No, hold on a second.

567
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,180
Oh, I'm in the bedroom.

568
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,520
Yes, I'm coming.

569
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,510
Was that the time to get ready?

570
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:28,511
It's hot.

571
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,290
Excuse me. I'm ready.

572
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,720
Let's go.

573
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
Are you OK?

574
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
I'm OK.

575
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Let's go.

576
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,070
Please put your clothes here.

577
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,170
Thank you.

578
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:28,171
Thank you very much.

579
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,630
This is a hair tie.

580
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,670
The bath is big.

581
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,200
Let's take a bath together.

582
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,520
Let's take a bath together.

583
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Great.

584
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,276
The hot spring here is very good.

585
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,651
Please change your clothes.

586
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,370
You must be tired from driving, right?

587
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,270
Yes, I am.

588
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,410
Wow, you have a nice style.

589
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,930
Your underwear is cute.

590
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,970
You look good in this color.

591
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,730
Thank you.

592
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Chihiro-San.

593
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
It's cold.

594
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,590
It's late.

595
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,170
It's embarrassing.

596
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,810
I don't think it's cold.

597
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,590
I'm getting fatter and fatter.

598
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,690
I don't think so.

599
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,450
Not at all.

600
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,130
It's cold, so let's get in quickly.

601
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,850
It's cold.

602
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:19,240
It's warm.

603
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
I'll go in first.

604
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,230
It's cold.

605
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,310
It's cold.

606
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,690
Oh, it's a river!

607
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,830
Excuse me.

608
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,130
It's cold, isn't it?

609
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,670
It's warm, isn't it?

610
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,770
It's warm.

611
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
It's getting warmer.

612
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,730
This is amazing.

613
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,170
It's wide, isn't it?

614
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,450
That's right.

615
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,830
It's quite wide.

616
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:16,210
I hope everyone will join us.

617
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,610
I agree.

618
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,790
It's wonderful.

619
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,420
It's a nice hot spring.

620
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,400
It's healing.

621
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:39,760
I wonder if it's embarrassing
to take a bath together.

622
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,420
I didn't think we would
take a bath together.

623
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,421
I don't think so.

624
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,900
Do you get along well with your husband?

625
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,760
Yes, we get along well.

626
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
That's good.

627
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,140
How about you?

628
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Well... Sometimes...
we quarrel a little, but...

629
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,280
we get along normally.

630
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:15,281
I'm glad to hear that.

631
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:19,320
My husband is young, so it's good.

632
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,380
I see.

633
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,360
He is full of energy.

634
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,480
My husband is old.

635
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,180
He is old.

636
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,820
There is a difference in age.

637
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:43,600
There are many people,
so the way of thinking is old.

638
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,980
I was worried.

639
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
I was worried.

640
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
I was worried.

641
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,660
It's a little sad, isn't it?

642
00:41:52,661 --> 00:41:53,661
Yes, it is.

643
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,280
It's a little sad, and it's fun.

644
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,620
Yes, it is.

645
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:02,920
It's not a big deal, is it?

646
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
No, it's not.

647
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,780
I feel like I'm getting bigger.

648
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,000
That's right.

649
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,380
I was wondering if it would
be okay to travel together.

650
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,340
The couple got bigger.

651
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,980
I think it's too much.

652
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,440
It's okay.

653
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,840
Are you tired?

654
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,630
Please take your time today.

655
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:34,460
I'll wash it for you.

656
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,720
Thank you.

657
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:35,900
Okay.

658
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
Okay.

659
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,911
Everyone, please come forward.

660
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Okay.

661
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,561
Teacher, please put out the paper.

662
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,990
If you don't do it right away,

663
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,890
um, bring the paper.

664
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,570
If you bring the paper out
with the paper, you can't see it.

665
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,210
Okay.

666
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,790
So, for the time being, if you
put out the paper with the paper,

667
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,570
um,

668
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,870
you can't see it.

669
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,350
This,

670
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,890
the wall behind it,

671
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,510
is the only thing that is visible.

672
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,090
Then, please confirm it.

673
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,091
What?

674
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,370
Wow, your skin is smooth.

675
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,250
I think your shoulders are stiff, too.

676
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,880
I think so, too.

677
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:33,340
Do you take care of your diet?

678
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,460
I didn't know that.

679
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,960
It's amazing that you can
wash your hair with that.

680
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
It's refreshing, isn't it?

681
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,620
It's good to be young, isn't it?

682
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,670
I'm sure you'll be told that it's messy.

683
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,970
You can put it in hot water.

684
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:26,530
It's warm.

685
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,711
It's been a while since I've had a bath.

686
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,250
I don't know why, but
Yano-San's face is a little swollen.

687
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,390
It's because of the sideburns.

688
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,090
Are you all right?

689
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,150
The sideburns are fine,
but the face is swollen.

690
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:51,151
I'll give you a massage.

691
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,070
You don't have to push yourself too hard.

692
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:59,770
I'll give you a massage from here.

693
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,130
Does it hurt?

694
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,860
It hurts a little.

695
00:47:18,390 --> 00:48:11,380
Is the view good from here?

696
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,460
I can see the mountains.

697
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,740
It's beautiful.

698
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Oh, really?

699
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:52,050
Is he an idiot?

700
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,930
Wait a minute.

701
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,950
Wait a minute.

702
00:48:58,951 --> 00:48:59,951
Wait a minute.

703
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,630
I was surprised.

704
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,230
What are you doing?

705
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,410
I was surprised.

706
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,790
I told him to go back.

707
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:14,970
I told him to go back.

708
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,170
I told him to go back.

709
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,610
I was surprised.

710
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,790
I was surprised.

711
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,650
Are you all right?

712
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,050
Are you all right?

713
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,870
I was surprised.

714
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:27,511
Chihiro-San, you look like a little girl.

715
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,951
Do you usually have a day off?

716
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,630
I see.

717
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:38,990
I hang out with my friends.

718
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,750
We drink together.

719
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:52,130
I think it's getting hot.

720
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,670
I think so, too.

721
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,750
It's getting hot.

722
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,070
I'm going to take a bath.

723
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,071
Here you are.

724
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,010
I'm going to take a bath.

725
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,850
I'm going to take a bath.

726
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,450
I'm sweating.

727
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,770
I'm going to take a bath.

728
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,750
I'm scared.

729
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,620
I can't see anything.

730
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,080
You can be quiet.

731
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,900
I can't see anything.

732
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
Did you wipe it properly?

733
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,820
Did you wipe it properly?

734
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,011
I have to increase the number of cameras.

735
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,000
I have to increase the number of cameras.

736
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:54,340
I can't hear your voice.

737
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,660
I can't hear your voice.

738
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,000
I can't hear your voice.

739
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:58,040
I can't hear your voice.

740
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,160
I can't hear your voice.

741
00:50:59,380 --> 00:50:59,500
I can't hear your voice.

742
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,740
I can't hear your voice.

743
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,660
I can't hear your voice.

744
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,620
I can't hear your voice.

745
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:08,621
I don't know what to do.

746
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,380
Please come in.

747
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,530
This is my husband's room.

748
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,140
It's a nice room.

749
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,100
It's hot and I can't go up.

750
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,130
Are you okay?

751
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
I went in too much.

752
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,740
It felt really good.

753
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,040
I was able to relax.

754
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,060
You were relaxed.

755
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Really?

756
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,170
I forgot my ring.

757
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,250
Really?

758
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,630
Where is it?

759
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:16,631
I don't think so.

760
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,781
Maybe I took it off
when I was taking a bath.

761
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,050
I might have left it there.

762
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,760
Are you okay?

763
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,920
Hey.

764
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,200
Are you okay?

765
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,040
I'm not feeling well.

766
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,820
Can I go to bed?

767
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:44,120
I have a bad feeling about this.

768
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,300
Oh, I see.

769
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,680
I think it's in the bathroom.

770
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,740
I'll go check it out.

771
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,040
Maybe it's in the bathroom.

772
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,420
I'll go check it out.

773
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:59,200
I'll go check it out.

774
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:25,350
There's no one here.

775
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:26,351
I don't know.

776
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,670
I don't know where it is.

777
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,330
Tegoshi, you haven't seen it yet, have you?

778
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,990
Let's go to the front.

779
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,590
I was surprised.

780
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,090
What?

781
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,770
I was looking for a ring,
and my husband left it there.

782
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,070
A ring?

783
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,690
What?

784
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,230
A wedding ring.

785
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,690
It's okay. I'll look for it later.

786
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:56,950
It's okay. You should look for it first.

787
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,891
But... Did you look for it?

788
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,651
I was looking for it,
but I couldn't find it.

789
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,010
If you stay here, you'll
end up in a strange place.

790
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:05,291
I'm afraid that I'll get a cold.

791
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,330
You might get a cold.

792
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,130
You might get a cold.

793
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,010
I'm afraid so.

794
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:13,870
I don't have a fever.

795
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:16,750
I don't have a fever.

796
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:17,751
No way.

797
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,250
You have a fever.

798
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:20,950
Yes.

799
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,970
Do you wash your face?

800
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,010
I haven't seen it yet.

801
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,550
You haven't seen it?

802
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,970
Okay.

803
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:32,430
When you wash your
body, It's amazing, isn't it?

804
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,430
Yes, it is.

805
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,550
Please look for it.

806
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,390
I'm looking for it, too.

807
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,560
It's amazing, isn't it?

808
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:46,900
Is there a gap or something like that?

809
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:47,960
It's amazing, isn't it?

810
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,460
I couldn't see it at all.

811
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,960
That's right.

812
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,550
Oh!

813
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,270
What is it?

814
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,830
No, it's a little different now.

815
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,550
What is it?

816
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:04,910
Oh, it's not here.

817
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,350
Yes, it's lower.

818
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:08,990
Is it lower?

819
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,370
Yes, it's lower.

820
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,470
Hello.

821
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:16,510
What?

822
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,890
Where are you?

823
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:19,830
Oh, hello.

824
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,670
Are you here?

825
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,480
Can I take a picture of you?

826
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,550
Yes, sure.

827
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,770
I don't have anything.

828
00:56:33,771 --> 00:56:34,771
Okay?

829
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,270
I'm going to sit down, too.

830
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,190
I'm in trouble.

831
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,770
Huh?

832
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,790
What should I do?

833
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,250
I'm going to sit down, too.

834
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,470
Okay.

835
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,570
What?

836
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:49,980
This.

837
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,900
The gap between the line and the line.

838
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:53,036
If you touch it, it will come off.

839
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,220
Yes.

840
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:53,940
Yes.

841
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,680
What should I do?

842
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,060
What should I do?

843
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,300
What should I do?

844
00:56:58,301 --> 00:56:59,301
Oh, wait.

845
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,440
Uh.

846
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:00,500
I don't know.

847
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,460
What?

848
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,901
What should I do if I come back now?

849
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:03,820
I don't know.

850
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:04,000
Ah, yeah.

851
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,600
It's hot.

852
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,580
The pants are a little, a little.

853
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,800
There is no panties.

854
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,860
I can not see.

855
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,650
Can not you see?

856
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,870
Do not see.

857
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Do not know.

858
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,100
I thought I was a little here.

859
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,220
I've lost my panties.

860
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,700
I was so angry.

861
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:36,760
This is the story.

862
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,640
This is a little.

863
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:38,641
I was surprised.

864
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,780
I was surprised.

865
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,140
She is standing.

866
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,650
She is attacking.

867
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:05,380
She is different.

868
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,700
She is a woman.

869
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,500
She is good.

870
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,140
I was surprised.

871
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,960
I was surprised.

872
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,640
I'm sorry.

873
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:23,641
Are you OK?

874
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm sorry.

875
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,060
I'm sorry.

876
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,220
Thank you.

877
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:36,760
Thank you very much.

878
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,780
Thank you.

879
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,180
Where did you get hurt?

880
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
On my back.

881
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,080
I was in a hurry.

882
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,900
Are you okay?

883
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,460
Yes, I'm fine.

884
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,100
Just a little.

885
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,040
You're strong.

886
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,700
Don't make such a loud noise.

887
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,480
Did you find the door?

888
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,060
No one will come back
until I give the order.

889
01:00:40,061 --> 01:00:47,050
I don't want to do it, but I have to do it.

890
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,190
Do you remember the last time we had sex?

891
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,770
Yes, I do.

892
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,370
I remember it, too.

893
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,990
Do you really remember it?

894
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:02,550
Yes, I do.

895
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,770
Really?

896
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,310
Yes, I do.

897
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,470
I want to be in your arms.

898
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:07,950
Yes.

899
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,100
I'm not in a position to do that today.

900
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,440
Oh, no.

901
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,380
I can't do that.

902
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,060
Do you have a reward for your hard work?

903
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,480
What?

904
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,420
I'm helping you, aren't I?

905
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:26,120
Yes.

906
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,640
What's your reward?

907
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,680
My reward?

908
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:39,250
Can I do it next time?

909
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:39,830
Can't you do it today?

910
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:40,970
After this?

911
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:41,270
After the meeting?

912
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:41,930
Yes.

913
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,410
But it's too late.

914
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:44,630
Oh.

915
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,606
I have no choice but to forget about it.

916
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,630
Yes.

917
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:50,370
Are you all right?

918
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,070
Yes.

919
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:53,530
Where were you?

920
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,090
I don't know.

921
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:56,910
You should go home safely.

922
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,470
Yes.

923
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,526
I'll be fine as long as I can
go home in a good mood.

924
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:00,890
Really?

925
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:01,650
Yes.

926
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:02,950
After the meeting?

927
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,620
Yes.

928
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,390
Oh, I'm sorry.

929
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,670
I was worried about you.

930
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:08,810
I'm really sorry.

931
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,230
I can't do it.

932
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,130
I can't do it.

933
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,210
I'm sorry.

934
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:23,430
I'm really sorry.

935
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,400
I can't use it.

936
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,860
I'm sorry.

937
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,860
I can't stop crying if I do this.

938
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:41,300
I'm sorry.

939
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:48,320
I'm sorry.

940
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:49,321
I'm really sorry.

941
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,700
I'll help you.

942
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:55,960
It's like your raw manko.

943
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:21,580
Wait a minute.

944
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,130
Are you still okay?

945
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,940
If you do that, I'll go.

946
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,100
Will you go?

947
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,180
I'll go.

948
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,220
No, you can't.

949
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,580
Can I really say it?

950
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,360
Yes.

951
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:51,800
Can I really say it?

952
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,060
Yes.

953
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:53,800
I'm serious.

954
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:54,500
Yes.

955
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,900
Then, slowly.

956
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,040
I just had a little bit.

957
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,800
It's itchy.

958
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,480
Be careful.

959
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,700
Please close your mouth.

960
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,140
You have half of it left.

961
01:04:38,015 --> 01:04:39,015
No. You can do it.

962
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,450
Please strain your mouth.

963
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:56,640
Strain your mouth.

964
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,440
You have the fifth one.

965
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,040
The fifth.

966
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,041
I'm sorry.

967
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:06,880
Oh, my God.

968
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,280
Wait a minute.

969
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:44,840
Please listen to me seriously.

970
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:53,700
Today's plan will be decided
by whether or not this will fail.

971
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:55,100
It's a turning point.

972
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,700
After this, the husband
and Jiro have a serious sex.

973
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,120
A serious one?

974
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,220
Yes, a serious one.

975
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:11,920
If it's not serious enough,
the whole plan will be ruined.

976
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,560
They show off how close they are.

977
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:23,740
And by doing so, by making her look at him,
she'll be able to overcome her jealousy.

978
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,120
And she'll be able to create a
state where she can't be calm.

979
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,191
I think that no matter what she does, even
if she panics, she'll be able to do it.

980
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,530
The fact that she's having
sex with her husband

981
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:42,241
and the fact that
she's stealing his wife,

982
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:47,980
The first goal was to make her
take away her husband's belongings.

983
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,620
After that, she went to her husband's room.

984
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:58,160
Then, Chihiro went to get
something from a high place.

985
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:02,896
Chihiro asked her husband to help
her get something from a high place.

986
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:05,700
Chihiro went to her husband's room.

987
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,240
Chihiro went to Irori's
room with her husband.

988
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:14,460
When you enter the room,
you will see Ichihiro's face.

989
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,920
Ichihiro will go to the room and call her.

990
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:24,960
Ichihiro will enter the
room with her husband.

991
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,451
You should start the conversation
as soon as you enter the room.

992
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,140
Ichi...

993
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,320
You should start the conversation
as soon as you enter the room.

994
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:35,321
Please start right away.

995
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:38,700
You don't have to hold back.

996
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,921
You don't have to hold back either.

997
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,360
It's like having sex with your lover.

998
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,760
When the sex begins...

999
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,000
I'll call Takahashi-San.

1000
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,940
Then I'll call Nana-San and
ask her to help with the cooking.

1001
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:03,160
I asked him to lead me to the front of
Irori's room and let me peep into his room.

1002
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,888
After I peeped into his
room, Mr. Takahashi,

1003
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,841
who was supposed to be
in charge of the meeting,

1004
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,276
brought Mr. Nanase to his room.

1005
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,380
He brought him to his room.

1006
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,780
I also prepared some sake.

1007
01:08:19,781 --> 01:08:21,301
I've already prepared a drink for her.

1008
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,080
I'll talk to her and calm her down.

1009
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,900
We'll have a drink together.

1010
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:26,901
I see.

1011
01:08:27,795 --> 01:08:32,000
I think it's best for her to
be sympathetic this time.

1012
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,131
There's no way to threaten her this time.

1013
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
I see.

1014
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:44,680
I think it's better for her to
be comforted by each other.

1015
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,500
I see.

1016
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:47,501
I see.

1017
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,260
Is it okay?

1018
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,900
If Takahashi-San's surgery goes well,

1019
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,500
you can come back to the monitor.

1020
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,280
You can observe her for a while.

1021
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,680
Really?

1022
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:04,980
If they don't do it,

1023
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,380
it's easier for her to panic.

1024
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Yes.

1025
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,260
It's easier for her to panic.

1026
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,580
If you're calm, it won't be like that.

1027
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:23,060
If you're in a normal state,
you shouldn't have time to think.

1028
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:25,930
You should be relaxed.

1029
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,920
Will I be okay?

1030
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,920
You'll be fine.

1031
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,580
What?

1032
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,600
You can do it like you did before.

1033
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,700
Like you did before.

1034
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,020
I'll do my best.

1035
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,740
I'll do my best.

1036
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,520
Are you ready?

1037
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,680
Please go back to your seat.

1038
01:09:58,590 --> 01:09:59,590
I'll do my best.

1039
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,140
I'm getting tired.

1040
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,960
She is here.

1041
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:46,070
I want to go in again.

1042
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,730
I want to sleep more.

1043
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,781
Before I go to bed, I'd
like to ask you something.

1044
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,350
Yes?

1045
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,010
May I come in?

1046
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,550
Yes, please.

1047
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,750
I can't get what I want in the
kitchen because it's too expensive.

1048
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,770
Can you help me?

1049
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:13,730
No problem.

1050
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,150
Excuse me.

1051
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,370
I'll be right back.

1052
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,710
Excuse me.

1053
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,050
I'm nervous.

1054
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:09,260
It's funny.

1055
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,480
I'm sorry.

1056
01:15:44,481 --> 01:15:45,481
It feels good.

1057
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

1058
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,860
I shouldn't have said that.

1059
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,880
You are kind.

1060
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,520
Do you lick me?

1061
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:29,220
It feels good.

1062
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,140
Oh, I feel good...

1063
01:16:37,685 --> 01:16:41,940
I feel good!

1064
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:54,890
I feel good!

1065
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1066
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:07,450
I got relieved.

1067
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,480
Please take your time.

1068
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,481
Let's go, let's go.

1069
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:26,100
Please think about it.

1070
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:44,300
It's a little scary.

1071
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:47,180
I'm sorry.

1072
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,010
I'm sorry.

1073
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,750
I'm sorry.

1074
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:44,740
I'm sorry.

1075
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,440
Is it okay?

1076
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,220
It's okay.

1077
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,561
I'm sorry Wow, she's so cool.

1078
01:21:40,280 --> 01:22:02,630
She's my wife I'm sorry.

1079
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,610
I'm sorry.

1080
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,250
My back feels really good.

1081
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,750
Ouch!

1082
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:20,130
It feels good.

1083
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:44,420
It's hard.

1084
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:08,260
I don't really feel well.

1085
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,380
I feel sick.

1086
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,140
I can't take it anymore.

1087
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:10,940
I'm sick!

1088
01:25:10,941 --> 01:25:11,941
I'm sorry.

1089
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:19,860
Did you feel good?

1090
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:21,390
Yes.

1091
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:53,110
It felt so good.

1092
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:55,410
Oh, my.

1093
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:02,610
It was great.

1094
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,610
Was it?

1095
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:06,190
Yes.

1096
01:26:06,191 --> 01:26:07,191
What should I do?

1097
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:07,870
Well.

1098
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,330
What should I do?

1099
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,570
I should hide it.

1100
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,070
I see.

1101
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:15,310
I have to change.

1102
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:16,510
Oh, I see.

1103
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:17,690
What should I do?

1104
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:18,810
I should hide it here.

1105
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,420
Are you hiding it?

1106
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:22,230
Yes.

1107
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,770
I was feeling good.

1108
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,310
I'm sorry.

1109
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,210
What should I do?

1110
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:32,790
I'm sorry.

1111
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,410
I'll go back.

1112
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:36,770
I have to change.

1113
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:51,950
I've already done this much.

1114
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,400
Let's go.

1115
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,020
Come here.

1116
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:24,690
It's okay.

1117
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:26,790
You should calm down.

1118
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,830
Thank you.

1119
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,120
Thank you.

1120
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:55,320
I don't know what to say.

1121
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:59,380
I'm sorry.

1122
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,960
My husband...

1123
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,000
My wife...

1124
01:28:06,425 --> 01:28:08,506
I think something's wrong
with you two this morning.

1125
01:28:16,895 --> 01:28:19,976
I think it's the first time you've had a
fight with my wife and your husband.

1126
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:27,170
If you don't tell my wife
about it, it won't end well.

1127
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:32,250
Don't tell her which one is wrong.

1128
01:28:32,251 --> 01:28:33,571
It's not like I'm going to do it.

1129
01:28:38,935 --> 01:28:39,976
I'm going to make a shirt.

1130
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,550
I'm going to make a shirt.

1131
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,330
I haven't had a wife like
that since I got married.

1132
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:53,750
I haven't had a wife like
that since I got married.

1133
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:57,950
I haven't.

1134
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,331
When I first came here, I
was told not to come here.

1135
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,021
And when Takashi-San came
here, I was told not to come here.

1136
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,400
Did you have any experience of coming here?

1137
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,180
No, I didn't.

1138
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,600
I see.

1139
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,640
I see.

1140
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,060
Thank you very much.

1141
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,720
Thank you.

1142
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:24,721
Thank you very much.

1143
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:32,400
We can't help but talk about it later.

1144
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,440
It's hard for both of us.

1145
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:45,060
It's hard.

1146
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,480
It's hard.

1147
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:48,720
Thank you very much.

1148
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:52,240
Thank you very much.

1149
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,960
Your wife is still young.

1150
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,900
There are many things to come.

1151
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:04,620
I think so.

1152
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,740
There are many things.

1153
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,310
To be honest, I was a little upset.

1154
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:33,970
Isn't it?

1155
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:36,110
No, I don't think so.

1156
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:38,010
Really?

1157
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,823
It's the first time you've
seen someone other

1158
01:30:42,835 --> 01:30:45,150
than you having sex
in front of you, isn't it?

1159
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,150
Yes.

1160
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:47,350
Right?

1161
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:50,090
It's a rare opportunity.

1162
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:51,730
Yes, it is.

1163
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:53,390
Right?

1164
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,961
It's the first time you've seen someone
other than you having sex in front of you.

1165
01:30:58,810 --> 01:30:59,470
It's amazing.

1166
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,830
It's a great thing, isn't it?

1167
01:31:05,025 --> 01:31:06,025
He is a person I know.

1168
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:08,370
Yes, he is.

1169
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,730
It's a great thing.

1170
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:17,551
After 5 or 6 years, a wife will lend her
husband to her husband for 10,000 years.

1171
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:21,030
It's the same as love.

1172
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:23,410
It's the same procedure.

1173
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,551
It's not like that, is it?

1174
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:32,250
If the person doing it is different,
you can say, Oh, that's how you do it.

1175
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:34,010
You can say,

1176
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:35,310
Oh, that's how you do it.

1177
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:42,450
Just now,

1178
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,870
in the bathroom,

1179
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:47,930
you saw me, didn't you?

1180
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,581
I was in a bit of a difficult situation.

1181
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:54,370
I see.

1182
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:55,830
How was it?

1183
01:31:56,690 --> 01:31:58,010
It was painful.

1184
01:31:58,090 --> 01:31:59,150
Why?

1185
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,070
I was surprised.

1186
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:19,780
It was my first time.

1187
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,640
I was surprised.

1188
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,120
I was nervous.

1189
01:32:26,121 --> 01:32:26,640
I was surprised.

1190
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,020
You were surprised?

1191
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,860
I was curious.

1192
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:34,780
You were curious?

1193
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,160
Yes.

1194
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,600
I'm glad to hear that.

1195
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,820
I was looking at you.

1196
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,400
Thank you.

1197
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,400
You look like a child.

1198
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,320
It's not fair.

1199
01:32:55,321 --> 01:32:57,620
It's a little unfair.

1200
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,300
Don't make me look away.

1201
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,040
You guys are studying, aren't you?

1202
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,980
He's gone to love.

1203
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,420
He's gone to love.

1204
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,900
He's gone to love.

1205
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:15,660
He's gone to love.

1206
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,520
He's gone to love.

1207
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:19,240
He's gone to love.

1208
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,500
He's gone to love.

1209
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:21,501
I understand.

1210
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,900
Wait a minute.

1211
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,160
Calm down.

1212
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,840
Wait a minute.

1213
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It's okay.

1214
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,920
I'm glad.

1215
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:45,160
My wife is doing more amazing things.

1216
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:46,161
I'm watching over you.

1217
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,920
I'm watching over you.

1218
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:50,960
I'm watching over you.

1219
01:33:52,915 --> 01:33:54,400
I'm watching over you.

1220
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:55,640
I'm watching over you.

1221
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:56,641
I'm watching over you.

1222
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:58,480
I'm watching over you.

1223
01:33:59,030 --> 01:34:02,700
I'm watching over you.

1224
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,400
I'm watching over you.

1225
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:12,460
If you don't do something, I'll be upset.

1226
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,280
I'm sorry.

1227
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,980
Really?

1228
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:24,430
You touched my wife today.

1229
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:25,910
My wife?

1230
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,470
I didn't mean to.

1231
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:31,110
I know.

1232
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:32,530
I didn't mean to.

1233
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,330
Don't touch her.

1234
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,190
I didn't mean to.

1235
01:34:37,191 --> 01:34:38,191
I'm looking for it.

1236
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:39,790
It's just a little bit.

1237
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:41,150
I see.

1238
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:53,620
She's moving it.

1239
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,420
She's looking for it.

1240
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:00,460
She's moving it on her own will.

1241
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,740
I see.

1242
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:18,720
It's no good.

1243
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,920
I've been listening to the sound.

1244
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,080
It's too quiet.

1245
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,960
I see.

1246
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:40,710
This time, she is accepting it.

1247
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:45,170
Look.

1248
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:46,530
She doesn't hate it.

1249
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:49,090
What do you think of this
from a woman's point of view?

1250
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,470
She is completely accepting it.

1251
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,270
She is touching her stomach.

1252
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:58,490
She is touching her chest.

1253
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:19,980
She is touching her chest.

1254
01:36:19,981 --> 01:36:20,981
Amazing.

1255
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,240
It's beautiful.

1256
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:01,420
If I can hug you like this...

1257
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:12,900
You won't let go of my hand.

1258
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,640
You know women.

1259
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:17,980
I know.

1260
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,880
I know.

1261
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:21,980
You remember me.

1262
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,221
You remember me even when you're married.

1263
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,461
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1264
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:35,020
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1265
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,840
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1266
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:39,711
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1267
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,640
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1268
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,360
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1269
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,376
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1270
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:53,740
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1271
01:37:53,741 --> 01:37:53,900
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1272
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,140
I'm going to take a picture of you.

1273
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:59,600
I don't know if it's going
to be conquered or not.

1274
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:13,780
This is...

1275
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:26,700
There's only one piece left.

1276
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,780
That's true.

1277
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,900
Can you do it?

1278
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,200
Probably.

1279
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:35,575
If you can't do it,

1280
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:41,510
Can you do it?

1281
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:42,830
You can do it with your hands.

1282
01:38:44,755 --> 01:38:45,590
Let's try it again.

1283
01:38:45,591 --> 01:38:46,591
Let's try it.

1284
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:48,330
Here?

1285
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:48,830
Yes.

1286
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:50,610
Just stay still.

1287
01:38:51,845 --> 01:38:53,366
You should go as far as you can touch.

1288
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:56,690
When your wife's
consciousness is somewhere else.

1289
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,046
If you go in this state, you can
hear the sound of something.

1290
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,510
I see.

1291
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,141
It's already being manipulated.

1292
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:07,831
I think the gravity will be 30,000.

1293
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,050
What is that?

1294
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:14,150
What?

1295
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:15,470
That.

1296
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:16,970
This?

1297
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:33,120
I'm not going to use it. It's just
something I personally want to see.

1298
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:49,290
I'm going to hide it.

1299
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:51,490
I'm going to hide it.

1300
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:54,370
I'm going to hide it.

1301
01:39:54,371 --> 01:40:14,240
I was thinking,

1302
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,300
It's fine.

1303
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:28,510
There it is.

1304
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:30,130
It fell.

1305
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:32,190
Yes.

1306
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:33,750
It fell.

1307
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:46,260
It looks so good.

1308
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,500
It's a dress I want to make.

1309
01:40:54,501 --> 01:40:55,501
No, it's not.

1310
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,110
It's completely down.

1311
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:19,800
For the time being, you can put it away.

1312
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,040
Really?

1313
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:32,810
I'll put it in front of you.

1314
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:41,690
I'll open the gap a little.

1315
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,810
The door is open.

1316
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,530
When you stop moving, you can breathe once.

1317
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:50,851
When you are doing something.

1318
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,390
When you are talking to someone.

1319
01:41:57,150 --> 01:41:58,490
When you are taking a picture.

1320
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:00,470
When you are active.

1321
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:02,710
When you are in a good mood.

1322
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:10,560
I miss you so much.

1323
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:35,180
I'm sorry to say this in front of
you, but I'm excited just to kiss you.

1324
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:36,700
I agree.

1325
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:41,240
It's so nice to have a partner
who forgives your body.

1326
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:45,100
I felt the same way at first.

1327
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,680
It's easy to feel.

1328
01:42:47,681 --> 01:42:49,040
I was surprised.

1329
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,540
The moment you were ready.

1330
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,100
The moment you betrayed.

1331
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,211
The moment you waited at home.

1332
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:55,800
The moment you did it.

1333
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:57,560
I still remember.

1334
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,510
I still remember.

1335
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:05,970
I still remember.

1336
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:06,971
It's beautiful.

1337
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:12,170
I said I was embarrassed.

1338
01:43:12,171 --> 01:43:13,171
I said I was embarrassed.

1339
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:14,690
You are beautiful.

1340
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:16,310
I'm sorry.

1341
01:43:16,410 --> 01:43:16,870
I'm sorry.

1342
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:17,871
I'm sorry.

1343
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:21,050
At that moment,

1344
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:28,300
my heart was taken away.

1345
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,120
I'm sorry.

1346
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,360
I resisted with my hands at the end.

1347
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,740
I resisted with my hands at the end.

1348
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:40,160
I'm accepting it, but.

1349
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,160
the last pose.

1350
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:45,180
I'm sorry.

1351
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,340
I'm sorry.

1352
01:43:47,341 --> 01:43:49,200
I'm sorry.

1353
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,560
I'm sorry.

1354
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:51,940
I'm sorry.

1355
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,340
I'm sorry.

1356
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:57,340
I'm sorry.

1357
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:21,700
What's wrong with your face?

1358
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:25,220
I can't feel my face.

1359
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:42,040
I can't feel my face.

1360
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:43,120
I can't feel my face.

1361
01:44:44,880 --> 01:46:09,470
Your face is a little swollen.

1362
01:46:12,095 --> 01:46:22,180
You have round eyes.

1363
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:41,800
You have beautiful eyes.

1364
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,600
What's wrong?

1365
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,120
Take off your clothes.

1366
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:53,820
Show me your beautiful eyes.

1367
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,900
I want to see your beautiful eyes.

1368
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:33,551
Even if I drop my upper
body, I have to be careful.

1369
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:39,940
It's beautiful.

1370
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:51,440
When I was looking for a ring in the
bathroom, I saw my wife posing like this.

1371
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:53,880
From behind.

1372
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:34,180
Do you see?

1373
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:36,240
It's coming in from behind.

1374
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:43,680
It's so deep.

1375
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,100
It's amazing.

1376
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:51,370
It's so tight.

1377
01:49:53,260 --> 01:50:27,130
Do you want to see it?

1378
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,350
Don't you want to see it?

1379
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:30,310
It's closer.

1380
01:50:30,311 --> 01:50:31,311
Are you okay?

1381
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:35,190
I'm sorry

1382
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:44,740
Did you wash it with your wife's hands?

1383
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,580
What should I do?

1384
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:54,160
Don't look away.

1385
01:50:55,810 --> 01:51:01,800
Look for it while stepping on it.

1386
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,420
I can't see anything.

1387
01:51:09,421 --> 01:51:10,100
I'm so happy.

1388
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:11,101
This is really big.

1389
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,280
I'm so happy.

1390
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,240
I'm so happy.

1391
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,540
I have to take off my panties.

1392
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:23,900
I have to take off my panties.

1393
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:25,420
I'm embarrassed.

1394
01:51:25,421 --> 01:51:28,620
I'm embarrassed.

1395
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:38,330
I could only see a little while ago.

1396
01:51:38,331 --> 01:51:40,530
But, look at me closely.

1397
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:43,270
I'm not your husband.

1398
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:56,640
Do you look down on me?

1399
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,641
I want you to look down on me, too.

1400
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:29,000
I've always wanted to look down on you.

1401
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:30,740
Really?

1402
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,040
Yes.

1403
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:31,860
Really?

1404
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:33,440
Yes.

1405
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:36,340
That hand is cruel.

1406
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,680
That hand is slow.

1407
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:54,970
You look like you're really sleeping.

1408
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:02,230
Do you remember?

1409
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:03,450
I want to surprise you.

1410
01:53:03,970 --> 01:53:04,970
I remember.

1411
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:05,450
Really?

1412
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:07,110
Yes.

1413
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:10,430
You were having a lot of sex.

1414
01:53:10,431 --> 01:53:12,270
You were enjoying it, weren't you?

1415
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,660
Wow, look at the other side.

1416
01:53:22,850 --> 01:53:24,340
You look like you're enjoying it.

1417
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:32,440
Your lips are delicious, too.

1418
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:37,000
Your lips are really...

1419
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,900
I can't keep this posture for a while.

1420
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,020
A little more.

1421
01:53:55,590 --> 01:54:07,810
Oh, my God.

1422
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,390
Your head is still there.

1423
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:37,830
What?

1424
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,610
Your head is still there.

1425
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:46,130
Just a little bit.

1426
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:50,131
I don't want you to put it in yet
I don't want you to put it in yet.

1427
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:51,830
Just a little more.

1428
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:54,711
Just a little more No?

1429
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:55,850
You'll be found out.

1430
01:54:57,130 --> 01:54:59,130
I want to put it in.

1431
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:02,150
You'll be found out
You'll be found out

1432
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:05,390
It's frustrating.

1433
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:13,510
I want to put it in.

1434
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:22,330
I want to put it in.

1435
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:28,890
I'm so tired.

1436
01:55:28,891 --> 01:55:29,891
Oh, my God.

1437
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:33,330
Oh, my God.

1438
01:55:37,705 --> 01:55:39,310
Oh, my God.

1439
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:44,530
I can't stand it.

1440
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:46,640
I can't stand it.

1441
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:53,100
Takashi, please look at the monitor.

1442
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,900
Rufina, what are you doing?

1443
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,440
Are you trying to put it in?

1444
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:59,440
I'm trying to put it in.

1445
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:00,500
Really?

1446
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:10,290
I forgot. I want to put it in as it is.

1447
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:13,790
I want to put it in, but...

1448
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:22,971
I want to put it in, but if I put it
in, it will be a burden to work.

1449
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,920
Don't rub it.

1450
01:56:26,555 --> 01:56:27,760
Wait a minute.

1451
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:33,560
I can't stand it anymore.

1452
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,280
I'm sorry.

1453
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:42,200
I'm sorry.

1454
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,660
It's painful.

1455
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:51,900
It's gone.

1456
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:53,940
It's gone.

1457
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:04,750
It's gone.

1458
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:05,751
You look sleepy.

1459
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:10,110
I'm sleepy.

1460
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:11,730
She's tired.

1461
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:20,860
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

1462
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:22,140
I want to lift your hip.

1463
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,500
Wait, stop, stop.

1464
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:27,320
I don't want to stop.

1465
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:28,140
What?

1466
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,440
I don't want to stop.

1467
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,961
You can't. Your hip will go up.

1468
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,040
Seriously?

1469
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:33,560
You're fighting against your instincts.

1470
01:57:33,561 --> 01:57:35,121
I'm in trouble with a fight with a cat.

1471
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:39,040
I can't help it because my back is up.

1472
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:48,080
I'm in trouble with a fight with a cat.

1473
01:57:48,081 --> 01:57:49,081
I can't help it.

1474
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:54,560
I'm in trouble.

1475
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,960
I'm in trouble.

1476
01:57:56,961 --> 01:57:57,961
I'm in trouble.

1477
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:05,700
It's hot.

1478
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,080
It's hot.

1479
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,420
Let's go over there.

1480
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:12,960
No, not now.

1481
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:14,620
Let's go to your husband.

1482
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,300
No, not now.

1483
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:28,640
Hey, you are sleeping.

1484
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:31,800
You are so small.

1485
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:02,430
I'm going to sleep for a while.

1486
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:06,050
I'm going to sleep for a while.

1487
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:25,910
I'm going to sleep for a while.

1488
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:46,720
I'm going to sleep for a while.

1489
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:52,103
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1490
02:00:52,115 --> 02:00:56,170
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1491
02:00:56,171 --> 02:00:56,250
Huh?

1492
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:57,450
Are you alright?

1493
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:05,790
Hey, listen to me, Hey.

1494
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:10,510
You always said that you
don't want to be taken by others.

1495
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:13,590
You said that.

1496
02:01:13,655 --> 02:01:21,150
I was talking to you before,
and I asked you to do this today.

1497
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,610
I wanted you to do something like this.

1498
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:31,490
So I asked you this time.

1499
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:37,370
You're surprised, aren't you?

1500
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:44,046
So my wife may be a little
shocked, but when I saw my

1501
02:01:44,058 --> 02:01:50,230
husband treating my wife
like that, I was a little moved.

1502
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:55,410
I thought I could understand that a little.

1503
02:01:58,650 --> 02:02:00,690
I thought I could accept it a little.

1504
02:02:00,691 --> 02:02:06,890
But I don't think he does it
because he doesn't like his wife.

1505
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:11,890
He loves his wife so much.

1506
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:19,010
But he doesn't spend
much time with his wife.

1507
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,450
I don't want him to change.

1508
02:02:23,451 --> 02:02:24,931
I don't know if I should do it again.

1509
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:28,070
In order to be with
your wife for a long time,

1510
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:30,911
you want to enjoy various
things, such as stimulation,

1511
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:34,610
and more and more with your wife.

1512
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:42,790
You don't want to enjoy this every time.

1513
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,100
It's different.

1514
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:47,170
Sometimes I feel like this is bad.

1515
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,070
I think so, too.

1516
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:51,851
She may be a little out of her mind.

1517
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:56,321
For example, while being
looked at by other people.

1518
02:02:59,690 --> 02:03:00,690
Look.

1519
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:24,580
Let me take it off.

1520
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:28,380
Let me take it off in front of your wife.

1521
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:29,800
Like this?

1522
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:31,060
Yes.

1523
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:36,970
Look at me.

1524
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:40,090
I'm a little shy.

1525
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:42,690
You are really shy.

1526
02:03:52,165 --> 02:03:53,246
You have a beautiful voice.

1527
02:03:54,255 --> 02:03:55,255
I'm a little shy.

1528
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:09,610
Did you peep at me?

1529
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:13,050
I peeped a little.

1530
02:04:13,051 --> 02:04:14,051
You are so naughty.

1531
02:04:26,570 --> 02:04:28,860
You were doing like this to me.

1532
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:38,200
You were doing like this to me.

1533
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,920
Do you remember?

1534
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:50,400
You were doing like this to me.

1535
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,780
Do you want to come here?

1536
02:05:18,781 --> 02:05:20,800
I want you to do it with me.

1537
02:05:22,675 --> 02:05:23,675
I'll give you a bath.

1538
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:49,351
Is it your first time in love?

1539
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,520
Please relax.

1540
02:06:25,645 --> 02:06:26,686
My wife doesn't get angry.

1541
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:29,090
Don't you get angry?

1542
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:34,880
I want to see you doing that.

1543
02:06:34,881 --> 02:06:37,680
If you do that, I'll do it for you.

1544
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:53,460
Does it feel good?

1545
02:06:57,110 --> 02:06:58,991
It feels better than when
you were in the bath.

1546
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:00,940
Your eyes are also very good.

1547
02:07:07,630 --> 02:07:09,360
Do you want to put up with it a little?

1548
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:12,380
Give me a kiss.

1549
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:08,650
How do you feel?

1550
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:22,630
Wow!

1551
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:23,230
How do you feel?

1552
02:08:23,231 --> 02:08:24,231
It's harder than before.

1553
02:08:25,135 --> 02:08:26,650
Wow! It's hard.

1554
02:08:29,030 --> 02:08:30,030
It's mixed up.

1555
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:39,000
Put it in your mouth.

1556
02:08:39,001 --> 02:08:40,001
Let me see.

1557
02:08:41,455 --> 02:08:44,900
Does it feel good?

1558
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:46,380
It feels so good.

1559
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:50,860
It feels so good

1560
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:53,260
It feels so good.

1561
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:55,720
Let me see your wife's boobs.

1562
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:58,740
You have a nice face.

1563
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:03,200
Show me your gentle face.

1564
02:09:16,825 --> 02:09:20,100
Do you feel good?

1565
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:28,620
Good boy.

1566
02:09:28,621 --> 02:09:29,800
You are good at it.

1567
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:55,680
You are the best.

1568
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:02,840
Nana, do your best.

1569
02:10:02,841 --> 02:10:03,841
Do you want me to do it?

1570
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:20,430
Does it feel good?

1571
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:22,230
Yes, it feels good.

1572
02:10:40,530 --> 02:10:42,450
Do you want to do the same as before?

1573
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,741
Because it was in the middle.

1574
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:49,290
Do you want to do the same?

1575
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:52,490
Do you want to put something in?

1576
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:58,170
It's a little dangerous.

1577
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:02,550
Do you feel good?

1578
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:13,460
You are so soft.

1579
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:19,470
I'm sorry.

1580
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,720
I'm sorry.

1581
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:38,460
I can't hold your tail.

1582
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:57,800
Show me your beautiful face.

1583
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:08,230
Come in again.

1584
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,530
Does it feel good?

1585
02:12:21,790 --> 02:12:25,910
Move it more comfortably.

1586
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:30,030
Good.

1587
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:44,240
Which one do you feel better?

1588
02:12:44,241 --> 02:12:47,920
How do you feel?

1589
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:49,220
Do you feel good?

1590
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:54,700
Do you feel good?

1591
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:56,300
Do you feel good?

1592
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,720
Good boy.

1593
02:13:19,710 --> 02:13:21,380
You have a good face.

1594
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,480
Is it in your belly?

1595
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:41,630
Let's see from the back.

1596
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:43,540
Nana-San.

1597
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:45,850
Is it in your belly?

1598
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:47,530
Look.

1599
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,110
He is looking at you.

1600
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:50,650
No.

1601
02:13:50,651 --> 02:13:52,370
I can't see anything.

1602
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:55,890
Do you feel good?

1603
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:05,420
Don't look at me.

1604
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:08,680
Do you feel good?

1605
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:24,100
Don't look at me.

1606
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:09,380
I'm going to put it in from behind.

1607
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,520
Lower your head like before.

1608
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:32,340
It's disgusting.

1609
02:15:48,820 --> 02:16:20,480
Does it feel good?

1610
02:16:21,900 --> 02:17:01,630
You're doing a great job.

1611
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:13,150
What's wrong?

1612
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:03,950
Your nose is bleeding.

1613
02:18:05,430 --> 02:18:06,870
Let's have a doctor check your nose.

1614
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:09,330
I'll check your nose.

1615
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:17,360
I'll check your nose.

1616
02:18:58,780 --> 02:18:59,780
Wow.

1617
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,340
What's this?

1618
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:03,600
It's messed up.

1619
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:06,600
I've been looking at it, so it's messed up.

1620
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:08,340
Your nose is bleeding.

1621
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:09,940
It's a big deal.

1622
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:10,941
Good girl.

1623
02:19:55,650 --> 02:19:56,750
Let me see your mouth.

1624
02:19:56,751 --> 02:19:57,751
Good boy.

1625
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:54,940
How do you feel, Oku-San?

1626
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:56,600
Are you happy?

1627
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:00,840
How do you feel?

1628
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:02,780
Do you feel good?

1629
02:21:16,440 --> 02:22:14,960
Lie down.

1630
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:41,870
Listen to the story of Takai-San and Jinbo.

1631
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:49,150
Which is better, Takai-San or Jinbo?

1632
02:22:51,430 --> 02:22:52,770
Which is better?

1633
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:54,810
Tell me.

1634
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:57,670
Which is better?

1635
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:01,130
Which one do you like?

1636
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:02,570
Which one do you like?

1637
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:09,920
This one.

1638
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:22,930
It feels good.

1639
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:29,020
It feels good.

1640
02:23:30,855 --> 02:23:35,670
It's amazing.

1641
02:23:48,370 --> 02:23:50,210
I feel good, too.

1642
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:53,980
I'm so sorry...

1643
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:57,771
I feel so bad... You're crying?

1644
02:23:58,510 --> 02:24:01,850
I feel so bad...

1645
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:23,080
How about this?

1646
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:45,400
I feel so bad...

1647
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,600
Wow! Look at this!

1648
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:03,270
It's amazing!

1649
02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:06,340
Honey!

1650
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:12,460
It's round, isn't it?

1651
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:17,140
It's the one I put in earlier, isn't it?

1652
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,440
It's the one I put in earlier, isn't it?

1653
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,490
How did you do it?

1654
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:10,690
You put it in from the side, didn't you?

1655
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:11,150
Just a moment ago.

1656
02:26:11,275 --> 02:26:12,690
What are you doing there?

1657
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:23,400
Look at me.

1658
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:25,760
You should look at me with your big eyes.

1659
02:26:27,990 --> 02:26:28,990
Does it feel good?

1660
02:26:30,225 --> 02:26:31,720
Does it feel good?

1661
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,820
You don't want to look at
me with that look any more.

1662
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:40,800
You don't want to look at
me with that look any more?

1663
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:43,620
Look at me.

1664
02:26:43,621 --> 02:26:44,621
I'm really sorry.

1665
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:51,800
She's crying more than earlier.

1666
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:55,520
I have a stomachache.

1667
02:26:58,200 --> 02:26:59,580
I'm the husband's only baby.

1668
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:45,530
I did it.

1669
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:46,230
More?

1670
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:47,730
You were greedy.

1671
02:27:48,390 --> 02:27:49,390
You did.

1672
02:27:49,850 --> 02:27:50,930
I'm really sorry.

1673
02:27:53,355 --> 02:27:54,530
You put toys in your stomach and cried.

1674
02:27:54,531 --> 02:28:49,180
I'm going to sleep.

1675
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:06,560
I'm going to sleep.

1676
02:29:08,205 --> 02:29:10,400
You were sleeping.

1677
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:12,780
I don't want to.

1678
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:14,500
I'm going to sleep.

1679
02:29:14,501 --> 02:29:15,501
Oh, it's hot.

1680
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:29,210
It's hot.

1681
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:35,040
Oh, it's great.

1682
02:29:35,350 --> 02:29:36,350
It's great.

1683
02:29:36,830 --> 02:29:44,260
It's hot.

1684
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:58,120
It's great.

1685
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:09,760
It's so hot.

1686
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,300
It's so hot.

1687
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:15,200
I'll make you hard.

1688
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:51,800
It's so hot.

1689
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:53,860
It's so hot.

1690
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:55,080
It's so hot.

1691
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:56,240
It's so hot.

1692
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:22,820
Can I put your hair in the big hair comb?

1693
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:25,780
Yes.

1694
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:26,960
You're so kind.

1695
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:28,300
Please put it in.

1696
02:31:39,415 --> 02:31:40,895
You two are wearing the same clothes.

1697
02:31:41,770 --> 02:31:43,150
Which butt is better?

1698
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:47,510
I want to see both of you.

1699
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:49,950
Oh, she is shaking.

1700
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:53,050
You are four-legged.

1701
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:09,770
Which butt is better?

1702
02:32:12,290 --> 02:32:13,370
Both buttocks are good.

1703
02:32:15,390 --> 02:32:16,450
I'll put it in.

1704
02:32:54,710 --> 02:32:55,710
Again?

1705
02:32:56,110 --> 02:32:57,110
You're fast.

1706
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,300
Oh, my God!

1707
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:28,420
Wow!

1708
02:36:28,421 --> 02:36:29,240
You've shed a lot of hair.

1709
02:36:29,241 --> 02:36:32,140
Yes, I have.

1710
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:33,440
You've shed a lot of hair.

1711
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:36,040
Look.

1712
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:37,360
You've shed a lot of hair.

1713
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:46,680
You've shed a lot of hair.

1714
02:36:46,681 --> 02:36:46,780
You've shed a lot of hair.

1715
02:36:46,781 --> 02:37:05,120
It's nice to see you.

1716
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:14,080
You look like a meat.

1717
02:38:10,755 --> 02:38:12,960
You look like a meat.

1718
02:38:12,961 --> 02:38:13,961
How was it?

1719
02:38:16,660 --> 02:38:30,260
In front of your husband.

1720
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:34,120
Me and your husband.

1721
02:38:39,850 --> 02:38:42,490
It was so sudden that
I couldn't say anything.

1722
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:48,080
Were you surprised?

1723
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:53,300
This is not bad.

1724
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:56,920
Did you feel good?

1725
02:38:56,921 --> 02:38:57,921
It was good, wasn't it?

1726
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:01,930
You had a very good face.

1727
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:07,690
I was about to melt in your eyes.

1728
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:13,010
You had a very good face.

1729
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:15,870
It hurts.

1730
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:27,180
I love you.

1731
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:30,190
Is this it?

1732
02:40:31,630 --> 02:40:32,630
This may be it.

1733
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:36,400
How is it?

1734
02:40:36,401 --> 02:40:42,200
I can't catch up with it.

1735
02:40:43,400 --> 02:40:45,320
This is it.

1736
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:55,750
It's dark.

1737
02:40:58,415 --> 02:41:11,870
I can see it.

1738
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:13,130
Oh, I can see it.

1739
02:41:26,500 --> 02:41:27,500
Oh, they are smiling.

1740
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:32,140
What a couple.

1741
02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:35,220
They may get along well.

1742
02:41:52,710 --> 02:41:53,830
They are getting along well.

1743
02:41:55,650 --> 02:41:56,650
That's good.

1744
02:41:58,400 --> 02:41:59,590
They are getting along well.

1745
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:01,990
They are getting along
better than in the morning.

1746
02:42:01,991 --> 02:42:04,030
Wait a minute.

1747
02:42:04,810 --> 02:42:06,210
Where is it?

1748
02:42:06,970 --> 02:42:07,970
It's no good.

1749
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:10,930
Is this it?

1750
02:42:12,290 --> 02:42:13,290
OK.

1751
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:17,070
I can't see it anymore,
so let's go over there.

1752
02:42:18,970 --> 02:42:20,590
Yeah, I'd like to talk to him.

1753
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:29,790
Thank you for your hard work.

1754
02:42:29,791 --> 02:42:30,230
Thank you for your hard work.

1755
02:42:30,790 --> 02:42:31,950
Thank you for your hard work.

1756
02:42:33,110 --> 02:42:34,230
I walked home with my hands.

1757
02:42:34,910 --> 02:42:36,950
You were in love.

1758
02:42:37,490 --> 02:42:38,910
I came back home with a smile.

1759
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:41,610
You may have been disappointed.

1760
02:42:44,710 --> 02:42:45,710
But it was good.

1761
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:48,270
It was a success.

1762
02:42:48,470 --> 02:42:50,150
I was wondering what would happen.

1763
02:42:51,370 --> 02:42:52,870
I was very nervous.

1764
02:42:54,110 --> 02:42:56,310
You were not nervous at all.

1765
02:42:56,311 --> 02:42:57,311
That's right.

1766
02:42:58,670 --> 02:43:00,090
You were having fun by yourself.

1767
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:01,550
No, I wasn't.

1768
02:43:02,530 --> 02:43:04,330
You were having more fun than me.

1769
02:43:05,070 --> 02:43:08,610
You looked like you were
going to cry at the end.

1770
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:11,750
Did I?

1771
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:13,150
That's amazing.

1772
02:43:13,250 --> 02:43:13,750
When we were hugging?

1773
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:15,430
I was wondering if you were okay.

1774
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:18,330
I was worried that you
would cry at the end.

1775
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:21,830
But it seems to be like that.

1776
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:23,270
Is that so?

1777
02:43:23,271 --> 02:43:24,991
I was told that I was going to get married.

1778
02:43:25,430 --> 02:43:26,770
I was relieved.

1779
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:30,350
But you didn't look like you
were going to get married.

1780
02:43:31,490 --> 02:43:32,590
I was relieved.

1781
02:43:34,170 --> 02:43:37,770
Thank you very much for your success.

1782
02:43:37,771 --> 02:43:38,190
Thank you.

1783
02:43:38,790 --> 02:43:39,790
Aren't you tired?

1784
02:43:39,930 --> 02:43:40,090
What?

1785
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:41,810
Aren't you tired today?

1786
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:43,230
I'm always tired.

1787
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:45,510
I'm tired because I have to work hard.

1788
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:46,650
Because you have to work hard?

1789
02:43:46,910 --> 02:43:48,010
What if I fail?

1790
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:50,290
That's right.

1791
02:43:50,291 --> 02:43:52,970
It's not easy for a young person.

1792
02:43:54,710 --> 02:43:56,510
Thank you very much.

1793
02:43:57,410 --> 02:43:58,990
Thank you very much.

1794
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:03,630
I'm going to send my girlfriend.

1795
02:44:04,970 --> 02:44:08,090
Thank you very much.

1796
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:09,326
Let's go on a trip next time.

1797
02:44:09,350 --> 02:44:10,350
Yes, let's go.

1798
02:44:11,070 --> 02:44:12,070
Is it okay?

1799
02:44:13,290 --> 02:44:14,650
Let's send this.

1800
02:44:16,050 --> 02:44:17,130
Please put your luggage over there.

1801
02:44:17,131 --> 02:44:18,131
I got it.

1802
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:19,230
I'll send it to you.

1803
02:44:19,650 --> 02:44:20,810
Thank you for your hard work.

1804
02:44:20,890 --> 02:44:22,050
Thank you for your hard work.

1805
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:23,310
Can you sign this?

1806
02:44:23,370 --> 02:44:23,690
Yes.

1807
02:44:24,390 --> 02:44:25,970
Please sit down.

1808
02:44:26,510 --> 02:44:27,510
Yes.

1809
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:47,890
I was going to say the same thing.

1810
02:44:48,385 --> 02:44:49,385
Oh, really?

1811
02:44:49,430 --> 02:44:50,430
I was a little late.

1812
02:44:51,470 --> 02:44:52,730
I'm still looking at it.

1813
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:56,370
As it is.

1814
02:44:57,850 --> 02:45:01,450
If you go back to the
professor, you'll be fine, right?

1815
02:45:01,550 --> 02:45:01,730
Yes.

1816
02:45:02,210 --> 02:45:03,570
The professor will be here soon.

1817
02:45:04,850 --> 02:45:06,790
Can I take you to the hotel?

1818
02:45:07,110 --> 02:45:07,310
Yes.

1819
02:45:08,050 --> 02:45:09,050
Can I?

1820
02:45:10,910 --> 02:45:12,630
I might not be able to take you back today.

1821
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:13,990
Really?

1822
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:16,210
Then...

1823
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:18,580
It's okay.
