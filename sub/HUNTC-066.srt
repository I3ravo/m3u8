1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,280
Good morning, Shin.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
Good morning.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm sleepy.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,420
What are you doing?

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,060
I'm reading a book.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,020
What kind of book? It's a novel.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,620


8
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:28,800
Is it interesting? Yes, it is.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,460


10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,880
Can I have a look? Sure.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,420


12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,300
Why are you studying?

13
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,120
I don't know why.

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,420
Why? You don't have to say no.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
You are cute.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,580
You are cute.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,450
Let's watch it together.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Let me see.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,440
Together?

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,860
Yes.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,080
It doesn't look difficult,
does it? No, it's not.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520


23
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,360
You like this kind of thing.

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,990
Yes.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
What's wrong?

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,920
What? Are you shy?

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,825
It's a little close.

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,180
Is it close?

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,440
Do you want me to go away?

30
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,940
No, that's not what I mean.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,320
Can I go closer to you?

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
I'm a little shy.

33
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,340
Are you shy?

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,220
What?

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
You're not running away.

36
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm not running away.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,140
You're not, are
you? Come closer.

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Good morning.

39
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,640
Good morning.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,800
What are you two doing?

41
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm reading a difficult book.

42
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,380
What is this? It's difficult.

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:42,920


44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
It looks boring.

45
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,650
Shuu-kun, are you reading this?

46
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,096
It's interesting, isn't it?

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
It's interesting.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,540
It's boring.

49
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
What is this?

50
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
Are you off today?

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Yes.

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,720
Do you read this on your day off?

53
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,440
I don't have anything to do.

54
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,620
Let's do something more fun.

55
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:04,621
Let's do something fun.

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,900
Let's do something fun together.

57
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,640
We are now brothers and sisters.

58
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,641
Right? Right.

59
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,060
Let's do something fun.

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
We have such a cute sister.

61
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,180
What's wrong? Nothing.

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240


63
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:27,866
You are watching too much.

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,040
No, I'm not.

65
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,041
You were watching.

66
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,780
She was looking at you.

67
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
She was looking at you.

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,380
No, she wasn't.

69
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,640
Do you like boobs?

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
No, I didn't mean that.

71
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,700
I just happened to look at you.

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
She was looking at you a lot.

73
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,100
She was looking at you a lot.

74
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,940
How about this side?

75
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,940
Shu-kun, look at me.

76
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,840
Look at me.

77
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,100
You like my boobs,
don't you? Look at me.

78
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,320


79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,320
Shu-kun, look at me.

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,500
You like this, don't
you? No, I don't.

81
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,720
What? I'm in trouble.

82
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,280


83
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Why are you in trouble?

84
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,500
Why are you staring at me?

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,060
You like my butt,
don't you? No, I don't.

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200


87
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
You're happy, aren't you?

88
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,900
What do you think?

89
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,680
Which one do you
like? I can't say.

90
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,940
Come here.

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,760


92
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,220
I have to study.

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Study?

94
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,000
Where are you going?

95
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,100
Hey, where are you
going? Oh, I see.

96
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,960


97
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,331
You did too much in the daytime.

98
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,940
You were too dry.

99
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
I had too much boobs.

100
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
No, you didn't.

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
But it was cute.

102
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Yes, it was.

103
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,731
I don't want to tease you.

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,760
I know.

105
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,980
I want to tease you so much.

106
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,280
You had a lot of boobs.

107
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Maybe I did too much.

108
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
Did you?

109
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,800
Didn't you look at my legs?

110
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,801
Didn't you see my butt?

111
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Isn't it me?

112
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,600
It's definitely me.

113
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
I think it's me.

114
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
What?

115
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
You saw my butt?

116
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Really?

117
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
I think I saw it.

118
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,120
I think it's me.

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Really? It's me.

120
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,820
No way.

121
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,180


122
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,525
What's up? I'm studying.

123
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,910
I'm studying.

124
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:54,210


125
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,570
Oh, you're studying.

126
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,231
Do you want me to teach you?

127
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,990
No, no, I can do it.

128
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,330
You can do it?

129
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:01,630
Yes.

130
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,410
Really?

131
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,010
Didn't you make a mistake here?

132
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,530
What?

133
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,811
Oh, yes, I made a mistake.

134
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,510
Let's see.

135
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,521
This is different,
isn't it? Let's see.

136
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,550


137
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,870
It's been a while since I
saw this, so it's difficult.

138
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,270
This is difficult. How can I do it?

139
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,510
It's difficult to do it as it is.

140
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,430
How can I do it? I don't remember.

141
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,150
It's difficult. How can I do it?

142
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,431
It's a little hot in this room, isn't it?

143
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,690
It's a little hot.

144
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,350
Let's turn on the air conditioner.

145
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,270
I feel like it's really hot.

146
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,050
I feel like I'm going to get sticky.

147
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,590
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

148
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,370
No, that's not it.

149
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,990
You were watching.

150
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,350
I haven't seen it.

151
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,090
You haven't seen
it? No, I haven't.

152
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,210
Is that so? You have to study.

153
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,070
I have to study.

154
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,510
It's difficult.

155
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,970
What was it?

156
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,390
Yes, that's right.

157
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,530
I think it's right.

158
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,210
It's difficult.

159
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,371
Can you solve the next question?

160
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,390
Yes, the next one.

161
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,270
Yes, yes, yes.

162
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,030
That's right, that's right.

163
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,690
Hm? What's wrong?

164
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,500
No, it's just a little...

165
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,850
Do you have a
stomachache? No, not really.

166
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,930


167
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,920
Hey, are you really okay?

168
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,930
Are you not feeling well?

169
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,391
Do you want me to check on you?

170
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
What's wrong?

171
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,340
What's wrong? Do you have a stomachache?

172
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,640
Do you want me to give you a massage?

173
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Are you okay?

174
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,311
Does your stomach hurt
so much? I'll help you.

175
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,120
I'm going.

176
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820


177
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,620
Are you going?

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Are you going?

179
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
Your stomach hurts.

180
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
What?

181
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
What? Wait a minute.

182
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,590


183
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,830
What's wrong? Wait a minute.

184
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,170


185
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,800
Did you take it out by any chance?

186
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
What are you doing? Nothing.

187
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920


188
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,460
Did you wash your
pants? No, I didn't.

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
It's dirty.

190
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500


191
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Why is it dirty? Nothing.

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
My sleeves.

193
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,580
..

194
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:11,581
What?

195
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,230
What is this?

196
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,150
Did you take a
picture? Let me see.

197
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,530
Let me see.

198
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,470


199
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,910
Why? Did Pekka do something to you?

200
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,570
No, he didn't do anything to me.

201
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,290
That's suspicious.

202
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,910
What did he do to you? Nothing.

203
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,490


204
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,430
Really?

205
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,950
Yes.

206
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,250
You have a hard brain.

207
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,230
No, I don't have a hard brain.

208
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,630
You have a hard brain.

209
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,150
No, I don't have a hard brain.

210
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,485
You have a hard brain.

211
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,570
Why do you have a hard brain?

212
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,880
I have to clean your brain.

213
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,410
No, I'm fine. I can do it myself.

214
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,950
But it's dirty, isn't it?

215
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,370
I'll clean it for you.

216
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,190
How is it?

217
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,090
Does it feel good?

218
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,350
Your reaction is cute.

219
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,950
I'll give you more foam.

220
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,290
How is it?

221
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,460
Do you like this?
It's very hard.

222
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,580


223
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I wonder if it's clean.

224
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
What?

225
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,460
What's wrong?

226
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
What?

227
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,358
This is the first time I've
ever seen a cat like this,

228
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,900
and it's been a while since
I've seen a cat like this.

229
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,101
I'm glad I was able to see
this cat for the first time.

230
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,940
I'm going to clean your ears.

231
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,960
You have a big earwax again.

232
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,380
Do you want me to
clean it? No, it's okay.

233
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,060


234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,760
You have a big earwax here.

235
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
Can I? Yes, you can.

236
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,100


237
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Why?

238
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,560
Why?

239
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,960
Why?

240
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,020
You gave birth to Rika, but
you don't give birth to me?

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,520
Why?

242
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,860
Why?

243
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,730
Why?

244
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:15,330
Why?

245
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:15,370
Why?

246
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,371
Why?

247
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,890
Why?

248
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:48,150
Ah, wait a minute.

249
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:49,151
I'm hungry.

250
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,110
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,830
Hey!

252
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,700
Shuu-kun gave me a lot.

253
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Did he?

254
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
What?

255
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,720
What do you mean?

256
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,340
I licked him a little, and he came out.

257
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Did you lick him?

258
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
Really?

259
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,760
I didn't lick him.

260
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,120
But you were washing your underwear.

261
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,860
I just touched it and took it off.

262
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,420
What? You just touched it and took it off?

263
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,040
Yes, and I licked it.

264
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
What?

265
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I just licked it.

266
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,800
But my technique is superior.

267
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,720
But you took it off as soon as I licked it.

268
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,560
It was really hard.

269
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I see.

270
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,920
I didn't look at it.

271
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,690
I guess my technique was great.

272
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,840
No, no, no. I just touched it.

273
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Let's ask Shu-kun.

274
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
Shall we?

275
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,300
Which one did you feel
better? Let's ask me.

276
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
OK, let's ask.

277
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Hey, Shu-kun.

278
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,980
Shu-kun, listen to me.

279
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,620
Listen to me.

280
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:15,580
You're up.

281
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,360
Can I sit here?

282
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, which one do you
like more, me or Rika?

283
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
Which one?

284
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,020
You just said it, didn't you?

285
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,540
But you said it to me, too.

286
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
I just touched you.

287
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,500
But my Ferra felt good,
didn't it? I can't choose.

288
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,060
No, you can't.

289
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,320


290
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,800
But you've been looking
at my boobs all the time.

291
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,500
You want to touch them,
don't you? No, I don't.

292
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,840


293
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,980
What about my boobs?

294
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,780
You were looking at my boobs.

295
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,480
What about this one?
Don't you want to touch it?

296
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:11,860
Don't you want to
see more? No, I don't.

297
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,160


298
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,870
Do you want to see
more? Look at this.

299
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380


300
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,100
It's so transparent.

301
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Which one do you
want? Look at this.

302
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
I can't choose.

303
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880


304
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,820
Why not? It's boring.

305
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,380


306
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Do you want to see
more? No, I don't.

307
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,620


308
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,300
Do you want to see more?

309
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:40,461
Which one do you want to see?

310
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,740
How about this one?

311
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,760
Which one do you like more?

312
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,820
Mine is bigger, isn't it?

313
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,120
You like the one that is not
big, don't you? I can't choose.

314
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,810


315
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,300
What? You can't choose?

316
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,500
Let me touch it and make sure.

317
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,920
Which one do you
like? Both are soft.

318
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,060


319
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Which one do you
like? I like both.

320
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,540


321
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Which one?

322
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Which one? Choose one.

323
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I can't choose.

324
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,160


325
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,540
Which one do you
want? That's right.

326
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140


327
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,500
Which one do you want?

328
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,610
It's getting bigger.

329
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Why?

330
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,110
You just took it out.

331
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,040
Let me see.

333
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,960
Wait, wait, wait.

334
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,820
Let me see, let me see.

335
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,780
No, no, no.

336
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:51,781
Ah!

337
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,580
It's getting bigger.

338
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
It's getting bigger.

339
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,850
Oh, no.

340
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Let me see.

341
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
It's embarrassing.

342
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,780
Which one do you
like more? I don't know.

343
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,320


344
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
You don't know?

345
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,620
Then, choose one.

346
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,780
That's too fast.

347
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
I feel good when I wear it.

348
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,060
Which one do you like more?

349
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,020
You can decide this time.

350
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Which one?

351
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Which one feels better?

352
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Which one?

353
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
Both?

354
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,750
The one in my mouth is soft
and feels good, right? No, it's me.

355
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,210
No, it's not.

356
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,650
Hey, you.

357
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:08,651


358
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,350
You did it again.

359
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,370
You did it so hard and went to the back.

360
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,010
What are you doing?

361
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,870
I want to do it, too.

362
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,230
Hey, you.

363
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,210
Hey, which one do
you like better? I like.

364
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,410
..

365
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,411
Oh, come on!

366
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:53,830
Oh, come on! I want more.

367
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,970
I want it.

368
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:59,050


369
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,030
I don't want it.

370
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,490
Give it to me.

371
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,670
Which one do you
like? Choose one.

372
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,970


373
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
Which one? Choose one.

374
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:18,550
Choose one.

375
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,225


376
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:24,090
You know which one, right?

377
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,950
Which one do you want to
have sex with? I can't decide.

378
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,410


379
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,290
Come on, decide.

380
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,710
Which one do I want to have sex with?

381
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,530
Then, put your life on the line for
the one you want to have sex with.

382
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,110
That's right.

383
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,430
Put your life on the line?

384
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,650
What do you mean?

385
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,030
So, which one do you want to have sex with?

386
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,606
Put your life on the line for the
one you want to have sex with.

387
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,350
Yes.

388
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:56,351
Here you are.

389
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,110
Thank you.

390
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,560
Can I have a cup of coffee?

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes.

392
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,580
You can have a cup of
coffee, can't you? Yes, I can.

393
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,480


394
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,765
Which one do you want?

395
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,080
What should I do? Tell me.

396
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580


397
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
What should I do?

398
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,960
She wants a snack.

399
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,420
I want you to be excited.

400
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,640
It looks good, doesn't it?

401
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,560
You can put a lot here.

402
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,760
Choose.

403
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,280
Which one? Tell me.

404
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,260
Which one do you like?

405
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,680
Come on, pick one.

406
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,420
Can't you decide?
I can't decide.

407
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,940
It's boring.

408
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,740


409
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,940
You want to pin it here, don't you?

410
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,240
Don't you have to pin it here?

411
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:17,315
Do you like it?

412
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
You have such a big boob.

413
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,540
You want to touch it, don't you?

414
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,180
It must feel good.

415
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,300
If you don't do anything, I'll lick you.

416
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Do you like it?

417
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,660
I want you to lick me.

418
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,920
Look, your nipples are very long.

419
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,560
Aren't you excited to see this?

420
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,080
Do you want to see more?

421
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,081
Do you want more?

422
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
More?

423
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,400
Wow, your nipples are so long.

424
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,100
Are you excited?

425
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,040
Hey, look closer.

426
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,970
Then, I'll lick you.

427
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:04,340
It feels good.

428
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,120
It feels so good.

429
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,121
Ahhhhh!

430
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,850
Huh?

431
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,920
Ahhh!

432
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Ahhh!

433
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,520
Ahhhhh!

434
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,820
Ahhhhh!

435
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Ahhhhh!

436
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,940
Ahhhhh!

437
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,940
Ahhhhh!

438
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:38,280
Ahhhhh!

439
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,220
Wow…

440
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,120
Which side of your
neck do you want to lick?

441
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:42,401
Which one do you want
to choose? This one.

442
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720


443
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,540
It's my nipple, isn't
it? I can't choose.

444
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,560


445
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
You can't?

446
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,230
Why?

447
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,340
Why can't you choose?

448
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
How about a kiss? A kiss.

449
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800


450
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,180
Which one do you want?

451
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:09,780
Do you want me to show you my phone?

452
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:10,941
Do you want to see your face?

453
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,580
You want to do like this,
don't you? Look at me.

454
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860


455

Shouko, put a lot of sushi on my coat.

00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:41,010


515
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,250
Mine is definitely bigger.

516
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,790
Mine is bigger.

517
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,030
Really?

518
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,350
Which one is yours?

519
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,351
Two people? Two people.

520
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,350


521
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,770
Two people?

522
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,810
Two people?

523
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,690
So, three people?

524
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Let's do it like that.

525
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,790
It can't be helped.

526
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,830
Let's do it with three people.

527
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,170
Let's do it with three people.

528
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,660
No, no.

529
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,100
I'm going to give Chikubi a treat.

530
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,260
Chikubi is very good at it.

531
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,320
Do you feel good?

532
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
You are so cute.

533
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
Do you feel good?

534
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,860
Do you feel good?

535
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,780
I want to lick your nipples, too.

536
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,280
Which nipple do
you like? I like both.

537
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,510


538
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,040
You are so cute.

539
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
You are really sensitive.

540
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,720
You are very nervous.

541
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,100
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

542
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360


543
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,640
Let me do it, too.

544
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Oh, it's big.

545
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,160
Do you feel it, too?

546
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,760
Which one do you feel good?

547
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,700
Which one?

548
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,340
Which one do you feel good?

549
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:40,760
I feel good on this side, too.

550
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,060
This side, too?

551
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,160
Then, this side.

552
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,060
How do you feel?

553
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,280
Which one do you feel good?

554
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,300
Which one do you
feel good? I can't see it.

555
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,180
I can't see it.

556
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560


557
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,210
How about this side?

558
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
Where is it?

559
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
This side?

560
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,870
Which one do you like? This one.

561
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,170


562
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:43,181
Today, I'm going to show you
how to make kimchi fried rice that

563
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:47,210
my mother-in-law made for me
when I was in elementary school.

564
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,310
First, cut the kimchi into small pieces.

565
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:52,770
I can't even make a sound.

566
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,250
I can't even make a sound.

567
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,120
I can't even make a sound.

568
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It was
hard, wasn't it? Like this.

569
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,260


570
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm a little bit nervous.

571
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,260
I'm nervous.

572
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,480
Can I put it in? A little bit.

573
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,160


574
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
A little bit?

575
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,400
You should put it in first.

576
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,140
No, Rika will do it.

577
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
No, Rika will do it.

578
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,580
No, Rika will do it.

579
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,060
No, Rika will do it.

580
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,720
You like it, don't
you? It's going in.

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You put it in.

582
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,500


583
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,660
Why do you put it
in first? It feels good.

584
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,480


585
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Wow, your neck is up.

586
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,240
It feels good.

587
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,520
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

588
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,640


589
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
Oh, that's good.

590
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,220
It feels so good.

591
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Wow.

592
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,580
Do you feel good?

593
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,080
Do you feel good?

594
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,520
It's better to sleep together.

595
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:51,600
It's better to sleep here.

596
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,300
I want to sleep here.

597
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,230
No, you don't.

598
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,570
You have to sleep here.

599
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,730
It's not comfortable.

600
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,350
Hey, go away.

601
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,730
No, I don't want to.

602
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,270
I feel good, so I'll go away.

603
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,830
I feel good.

604
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,310
No, don't go there.

605
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,250
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,350
Let's switch.

607
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,670
No, no, no.

608
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,070
Let's switch.

609
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,010
You are wrong.

610
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,350
Why?

611
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,190
You want to put it in my
belly, don't you? No, I don't.

612
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,290


613
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,670
You are cheating.

614
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,650
I'm so sorry.

615
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,330
I'm sorry.

616
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,080
You shouldn't do that, Chikurin-chan.

617
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Why?

618
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
You'll get cold.

619
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,240
I'm not cold at all.

620
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,640
That's not fair.

621
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:53,520
Put it in for me too.

622
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,130
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

623
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:37,570


624
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,190
I'm going to sleep.

625
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,730
Hey, next it's my turn.

626
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,990
Get out of my way.

627
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
Get out of my way.

628
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,550
I don't want to get up.

629
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,590
Why? It's my turn.

630
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,590


631
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,510
It's finally my turn.

632
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,310
I'm going to put it in.

633
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:26,830
I want to put it in.

634
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:33,600
It's hard.

635
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:35,520
It's hard.

636
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,260
It's hard.

637
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Does it feel good?

638
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,700
Does it feel good?
My neck hurts.

639
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:14,070
I'm so tired.

640
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:15,071
I feel so good.

641
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,570
I feel so good.

642
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,850


643
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,750
I'm going to sleep.

644
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:02,820
I'm going to sleep.

645
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,260
I can't sleep.

646
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,900
Go to sleep.

647
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,300
Go to sleep.

648
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,940
Oh, it's so good.

649
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,560
Come here.

650
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,780
It's a bit painful, isn't it?

651
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,480
No, it's painful from behind.

652
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,360
It's okay, isn't it?

653
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,260
Oh, it's so good.

654
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,270
Oh, no!

655
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,950
Oh, no!

656
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,410
Oh, no! More!

657
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,250
I want more! No, no, no.

658
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,580
No, put it in.

659
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,500
Hey, put it in.

660
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,920


661
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,640
Why?

662
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,380
Why?

663
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:05,660
I told you twice.

664
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,040
Hey, you're not a child anymore.

665
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,540
Hey, you're always like that.

666
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
Why?

667
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,560
You're always like that.

668
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:23,561
That's right, isn't
it? That's right.

669
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,300


670
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,940
That's not fair.

671
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It feels good.

672
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,140
Does it feel good?

673
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,980
It feels good, doesn't it?

674
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,041
You have such a small ear.

675
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Do you feel good?
I feel so good.

676
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,330
I feel so good.

677
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,530
I feel so good.

678
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:29,670
You like this one,
don't you? Yes, I do.

679
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,850


680
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,980
Here you are, Harami-chan.

681
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Wow!

682
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,720
You just said it, didn't you?

683
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,120
Why?

684
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,440
I said it, but it's not over yet.

685
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,100
You just said it, didn't you?

686
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,760
It's not over yet.

687
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,780
That's not fair.

688
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,720
I like it better.

689
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:27,480
How do you feel?

690
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:28,481
How do you feel?

691
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,600
Isn't it painful? I'm sorry.

692
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,520
You like my neck,
don't you? I'm sorry.

693
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,440
I'm going to take it off.

694
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,500
It feels good.

695
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,160
I feel sick.

696
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:31,080
Even if I let Rika go, she
won't change, so I'll let Shuu go.

697
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,740
No, you can't do that.

698
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,500
Because she won't change.

699
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,540
I feel sick.

700
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,380
I can't stand it.

701
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,620
I can't stand it.

702
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:54,621
Ouch!

703
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,100
Hey, isn't it too much?

704
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,740
Wow, it's a lot.

705
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,740
Hey, it's too much.
Is there any left for me?

706
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:22,320
Hey, give me some, too.

707
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,800
You can still stand up?

708
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,660
Yes, I can stand up.

709
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,500
Then, let me help you.

710
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,520
Does it feel good?

711
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,360
Does it feel good?

712
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,990
Oh, it feels good.

713
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,670
Ah, it feels good.

714
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,010
But it's soft.

715
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,190
Ah, it's soft.

716
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:11,030
Ah.

717
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,031
Ah, it's soft.

718
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,170
Ah.

719
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,090
Ah.

720
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,940
Ah, it feels good.

721
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,100
Oh, it's soft, isn't it?

722
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,180
Give me your hands.

723
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,160
Give me your hands.

724
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:28,300
You do it.

725
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:29,800
Help me.

726
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,640
What's wrong? Let's go.

727
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:37,461
Ouch!

728
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,680
Ouch!

729
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,020
Ouch!

730
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:43,021
You are doing great.

731
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,450
It's so exciting.

732
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:46,880
You are doing great.

733
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
You have a lot of them.

734
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,880
Wow!

735
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,380
You are doing great.

736
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,181
I'm glad you bought it for me.

737
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,240
It's a little too much.

738
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,060
Let's do it again. You can do
more, can't you? Let's drop it.

739
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,560
No, this way.

740
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,680
Why? No, this way.

741
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,580


742
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,140
I don't want to.

743
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,680
I don't want to.

744
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:16,160
I don't want to.

745
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:17,640
Hurry up.

746
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,680
Why? It's too much.

747
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,121
How do you feel? I feel good.

748
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:22,895


749
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,260
Wow, your tailbone is so hard.

750
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,840
I feel good.

751
00:53:03,195 --> 00:53:05,330
I feel good.

752
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:06,331
It feels so good.

753
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,190
Put it in my bag.

754
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,550
Put it in my bag.

755
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:22,970
Why?

756
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,570
It's a good bag, isn't it?

757
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,250
You put a lot of things in it.

758
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,530
It's not fair.

759
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,430
It feels so good.

760
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,650
I feel like I'm going to fail.

761
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,870
It feels good.

762
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,010
It feels good.

763
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,350
It feels good.

764
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,920
I want to see my mom and dad.

765
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,320
I want to see my mom and dad.

766
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:27,650
Help me!

767
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,830
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

768
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,350
I'm so tired.

769
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,650
I'm so tired.

770
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,070
I'm so tired.

771
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:01,071
I'm so tired.

772
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:02,490
You're so tired.

773
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:07,690
I didn't feel good.

774
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,550
That's great.

775
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:16,750
You two made up.

776
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,030
Which one do you
like more? Choose one.

777
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,790
I can't choose.

778
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,170


779
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Why not?

780
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,390
Let's do it with three of us next time.

781
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,890
At that time, you decide which one.

782
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:36,891
Make up your mind.

783
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:37,370
Yes.

784
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:38,850
Absolutely.

785
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:39,910
It's a promise.

786
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,070
What?

787
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,010
I want to kiss you.

788
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:47,630
Why? Good morning.

789
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,210
Good morning.

790
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm sleepy.

791
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,180


792
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,160
Dad and Mom left in the morning.

793
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Really?

794
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,611
They said they wouldn't come back today.

795
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,661
Where did you go? Are you
listening to something? I'm sleepy.

796
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,140


797
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,960
Did you have breakfast?

798
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,840
No, I'm still sleepy.

799
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,420
I'm sleepy.

800
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,180
The weather is nice.

801
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,420
What's wrong?

802
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,440
It's better to sit down normally.

803
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,940
No, I'm fine.

804
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,920
I feel good.

805
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,980
It's comfortable.

806
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,950
What should I do
today? Good morning.

807
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,700


808
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,960
Good morning, Kana-chan.

809
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,020
What are you doing? I'm sleepy.

810
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:03,840
It's just right.

811
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,720
It's not fair.

812
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,140
Masa-san, you try it too.

813
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,480
It's comfortable.

814
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
It's good.

815
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,340
I'm sleepy.

816
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,760
It's good.

817
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,500
I can do it twice.

818
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,780
I want to sit there, too.

819
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
No.

820
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,920
My special seat.

821
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,501
What are you going to do today, Tomo-kun?

822
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,100
I'm going to put on my seat belt.

823
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,000
It's dangerous, so I'm
going to put on my seat belt.

824
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,460
Can you put it on for me?

825
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,540
It's heavy, isn't it?

826
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,460
Is it heavy? No, it's not.

827
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,860
It's not heavy.

828
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,160


829
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,640
Let's hang out tomorrow.

830
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,800
You can hang out with me.

831
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,680
What do you want to do?

832
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:08,976
What do you want to do with me?

833
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,700
A drive-in date.

834
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,840
What's that?

835
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,880
My parents are not home today.

836
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,660
Really?

837
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,380
They're not home.

838
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,381
Don't cry.

839
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Let's do it.

840
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,840
What do you want to do today?

841
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,180
What do you want to do?

842
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,410
Oh, no, I'm going back to my room.

843
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:01,930
What? Oh, he's gone.

844
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:03,490


845
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,880
Maybe because he was a little erotic.

846
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,680
Could it be that he's a virgin?

847
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,140
What? With that face?

848
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,170
Isn't it too stimulating?

849
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,740
Really?

850
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
Because I touched you.

851
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,960
I touched you, too.

852
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:20,760
Really?

853
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,760
You couldn't stand my
sexiness, so you ran away.

854
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,160
Because you held my futon.

855
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:27,580
That's it.

856
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,820
No, no. Because I was
rustling like this, you felt good.

857
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,140
I was rustling, too.

858
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
No, it's me.

859
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,560
No, Ayaka is still no good.

860
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,020
Why do you say that?

861
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,080
It's definitely me.

862
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,040
No, no.

863
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,240
Let's do this.

864
00:59:45,055 --> 00:59:46,500
I want to do this, too.

865
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,700
I want to do this, too.

866
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,660
Let me ask you something.

867
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,260
What?

868
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:53,680
Which one do you prefer?

869
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:56,940
I'll never tell you.

870
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,120
I don't know.

871
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,800
I'll ask you.

872
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,060
What?

873
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,000
Kana, wait there.

874
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:04,700
What? Don't get up.

875
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,820


876
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,560
OK.

877
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,940
Wait there.

878
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,340
What are you doing?

879
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,240
What?

880
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:19,810
Are you studying? What? Show me.

881
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:22,580
Show me.

882
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:23,850


883
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,380
Mathematics!

884
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,820
Do you understand it? Show me.

885
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:31,630


886
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,160
Where did you
do it? Here? I see.

887
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:39,920
Oh my god.

888
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640


889
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,480
You may not understand it.

890
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:46,500
How do you do it? Tell me.

891
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,160
I don't know how to do it.

892
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:55,300
Put this on here and grab it.

893
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,200
Am I wrong?

894
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,240
What's wrong?

895
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,500
Are you nervous?

896
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:09,966
You don't have to be nervous.

897
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,220
It's okay. We are brothers.

898
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,480
I'm older than you.

899
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,920
Why are you so nervous?

900
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,580
Your shoulders are so stiff.

901
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,060
I'll loosen your shoulders.

902
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:31,660
Is this part stiff, too?

903
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,800
Is it stiff?

904
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,740
Are you nervous?

905
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,480
You are very stiff.

906
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,660
What's wrong?

907
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:55,160
Are you OK?

908
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,980
We are brothers, so let's get along.

909
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,020
You've grown up so much.

910
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,000
I have to loosen you up.

911
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,640
What? Are you okay?

912
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,560
I'll do my best.

913
01:02:19,765 --> 01:02:20,880
I'm fine.

914
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,820
Really? I don't think so.

915
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,460
Do you do this
for me? No, I don't.

916
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,780
You don't? Thank you.

917
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,020


918
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,300
How do you feel?

919
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,560
You seem to feel good.

920
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,880
Here, here.

921
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,640
Shiko-shiko.

922
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,840
It's getting harder and harder.

923
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,860
Great.

924
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,311
Does it feel good here, too?

925
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,680
Yes.

926
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,700
I'll give you a lot more.

927
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,860
No? I'm sorry.

928
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:28,760
It's OK.

929
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,140
You'll get it out.
I'll make it clean.

930
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,190
I'll wash it for you.

931
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,880
I'm sorry.

932
01:03:53,190 --> 01:04:01,990
It's delicious.

933
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,230
What should I do next?

934
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:12,490
I wonder if I can do it.

935
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,580
What are you doing?

936
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Oh, wait a minute.

937
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,360
Pants.

938
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,070
Pants are wet.

939
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Did you wash your pants?

940
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,700
Yes.

941
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:01,900
Why? What? Nothing.

942
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:02,020
Go on.

943
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320


944
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,420


945
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
What?

946
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,080
What?

947
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,110
Were you washing there?

948
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,460
Yes.

949
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,340
I see.

950
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,680
I'll do it for you.

951
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,960
No, I'm fine.

952
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,000
What?

953
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,180
I'll clean it for you.

954
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,680
My cheek...

955
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:33,190
It's dirty.

956
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:34,191
Did you sleep well?

957
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,201
I'm going to clean your ears.

958
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,710
Does it feel good?

959
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:57,830
Tama-Tama

960
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,320
Why are you laughing? Well.

961
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,640
..

962
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,980
Do you have a runny nose?

963
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,141
You're getting bigger and bigger.

964
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,620
It feels good.

965
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,940
What's wrong with you?

966
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:03,820
Did Aya do something bad to you?

967
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,560
Bad? That's right.

968
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,320
I see.

969
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,370


970
01:07:20,155 --> 01:07:21,460
I wonder if I can do it.

971
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,440
What did Ayaka
do to you? Nothing.

972
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,920


973
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:37,930
What?

974
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,600
Something you can't tell me?

975
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,720
Are you clean now? You are big.

976
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:37,100


977
01:08:38,985 --> 01:08:40,386
Does that mean you are still dirty?

978
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:50,600
I'm going to clean your mouth.

979
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:53,800
Don't do that.

980
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,320
Don't you need a
towel? No, I don't.

981
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,900


982
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:30,220
You're getting used to it.

983
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,400
You're so cute.

984
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:45,170
〈 Chinese 〉

985
01:09:53,970 --> 01:10:18,370
〈 French 〉

986
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,650
Ah!

987
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:20,510
Ah…

988
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,450
Oh no, no, no, no.

989
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:25,451
Hehe

990
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:27,105
Ah!

991
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,120
Ah! No!

992
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:31,620
Yeah!

993
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,900
Hehehehe

994
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,340
Wow! You got it out.

995
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,420


996
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:40,490
Yeah! You're good.

997
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,240


998
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:44,800
Ah!

999
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,380
Hehehe Oh!

1000
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:48,080
Sorry! I'm sorry.

1001
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:49,081
I let him go.

1002
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,570
I see.

1003
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,310


1004
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,750
He was very fast.

1005
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:17,951
I let him go very quickly.

1006
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,970
I was also full of spirit.

1007
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:25,770
I was full of spirit.

1008
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:27,430
I see.

1009
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,051
But when I touched his
neck, he seemed to be

1010
01:11:32,063 --> 01:11:36,310
in a good mood, so I
think I was more excited.

1011
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,310
I took a nap and went to the bathroom.

1012
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,386
That's why I went there right away.

1013
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:46,610
I was so excited.

1014
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:50,690
But I think I was definitely faster.

1015
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,150
It was really fast.

1016
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:55,490
I went there right away.

1017
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:00,541
That's because it's in the
morning, but I'm going to sleep right

1018
01:12:00,553 --> 01:12:04,010
away on the second one, so I'm
more excited about the second one.

1019
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,570
No, no, no.

1020
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,781
I'm sure you want to be
in a relationship with me.

1021
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,990
No, I definitely want to be
in a relationship with me.

1022
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,910
I have no choice but to ask.

1023
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,390
Let's go to bed.

1024
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,820
Please sit down.

1025
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:32,560
Are you ready?

1026
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,920
Which one do you want to have sex with?

1027
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:40,700
What?

1028
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,840
Which one do you want to
have sex with? I have one.

1029
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,900
Choose one.

1030
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,380


1031
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,940
I was better, wasn't I?

1032
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,450
It's me, isn't it? No, no, no.

1033
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,360
It's me, isn't it?

1034
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,111
Which one do you like better?

1035
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:03,731
You were so excited, weren't you?

1036
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:12,890
Which one? Answer me.

1037
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,130
Do you remember my hair?

1038
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:21,670
I can do it, too.

1039
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:22,671
What? Oh, I see.

1040
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:28,540


1041
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:38,960
Do you remember the room in the bathroom?

1042
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,181
This room is more comfortable.

1043
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,490
Look.

1044
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,260
Are you comparing?

1045
01:13:54,655 --> 01:13:58,360
I'll put it to your neck.

1046
01:13:58,361 --> 01:13:59,500
I'll put it on your chest.

1047
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,660
I'll put it on your chest, too.

1048
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,350
Look at me.

1049
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,640
You were looking at me, weren't you?

1050
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,160
You were looking at me
and standing up, weren't you?

1051
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,160
You can touch it.

1052
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:55,080
Did you take it off?

1053
01:14:57,395 --> 01:14:58,760
You have a good reaction.

1054
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,400
It's not good.

1055
01:15:06,065 --> 01:15:08,000
It's OK.

1056
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:09,001
You look very good.

1057
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,560
You are a dear.

1058
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,800
Pinpon-! Hehehe.

1059
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,600


1060
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,020
Little boy?

1061
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:18,450
Your wrist is so cute.

1062
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,950
He's not a pinpon yet.

1063
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,620
He's a purring.

1064
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,860
Are you happy?

1065
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,720
You look so good.

1066
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:34,721
You look sleepy.

1067
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,520
You are getting sleepy.

1068
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,780
I'm sleepy, too.

1069
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,520
I'm sleepy, too.

1070
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,900
Do you like being sleepy?

1071
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,680
Do you like it? Good night.

1072
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,840


1073
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,560
Which one do you feel better?

1074
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,020
This one, right?

1075
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,720
You're twitching.

1076
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,740
I'll pinch you.

1077
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:33,530
It feels better to lick directly.

1078
01:16:33,531 --> 01:16:34,531
I'm sorry.

1079
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:46,780
If you lick it, it will be more sticky.

1080
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,210
No, I really don't want to lick it.

1081
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,170
I can't see it.

1082
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:17,190
Hey, look at me.

1083
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,730
Can you hear me?

1084
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,850
It's good, isn't it?

1085
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:45,270
Don't laugh so much.

1086
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,240
You look like you're in pain.

1087
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,350
You're bothering me.

1088
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,310
You're so cute.

1089
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,210
Are you excited again?

1090
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:08,310
I'll show you something good.

1091
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,350
Look at me.

1092
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,630
Look at me carefully.

1093
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,660
1,2,3,4

1094
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:37,300
Do you like this one?

1095
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,160
Which one do you
want to touch? This one.

1096
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:41,780
It's so soft.

1097
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,980


1098
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,100
You can stand up.

1099
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:52,951
You can touch it a lot and lick it.

1100
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,080
You like it, don't you?

1101
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,140
Do you want me to rub
your butt? No, I don't.

1102
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:05,520
I see.

1103
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,620
It's a luxury.

1104
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,140


1105
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,200
Do you want me to rub your butt?

1106
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,440
Then, I'll show you my front face.

1107
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:50,790
You can rub my butt.

1108
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,950
I can see the hole in your butt.

1109
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:02,670
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

1110
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,590
Which butt do you like?

1111
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,970
Let me touch it.

1112
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,590
How is it? It's soft.

1113
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,690


1114
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:17,910
It's soft, isn't it?

1115
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,050
It's a good butt.

1116
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,150
It's good, isn't it? It's soft.

1117
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,190


1118
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,690
It's a little ticklish.

1119
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,190
Really?

1120
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:25,790
Yes.

1121
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:27,350
It's ticklish.

1122
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,640
It's soft.

1123
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,960
Do you want to touch it?

1124
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,720
How is it?

1125
01:20:45,995 --> 01:20:47,036
It's like a yellow tickle.

1126
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,220
It's good, isn't
it? This tickle.

1127
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240


1128
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,380
How is it? It's the same.

1129
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:52,230


1130
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,040
Which one do you like more?

1131
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,700
I like the left one.

1132
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:00,980
This one.

1133
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,320
Oh, this one.

1134
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It's stuck.

1135
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,520
It's stuck.

1136
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,600
Look at this, Tomo-kun.

1137
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,720
My nipples are stuck.

1138
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,981
Your nipples and nipples are stuck.

1139
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,760
Is it erotic? It feels good.

1140
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,320


1141
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,640
Right?

1142
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,540
Is it okay? I like you.

1143
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,840
It's soft.

1144
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,420
It feels good.

1145
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,900


1146
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,320
My voice is coming out.

1147
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:38,390
It feels good.

1148
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,180
What are you doing?

1149
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,040
Do you like this? You like it.

1150
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,090
Look at me.

1151
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,290


1152
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:45,710
I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.

1153
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:45,990
You look more comfortable than I do.

1154
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,210
Really? It feels good.

1155
01:23:02,695 --> 01:23:04,360


1156
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:06,330
I want you to stop.

1157
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:07,880
I'm sleepy.

1158
01:23:07,881 --> 01:23:16,450
You are beautiful.

1159
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,060
You are amazing.

1160
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,300
You are cute.

1161
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:54,840
Let's kiss.

1162
01:23:54,890 --> 01:24:06,440
I'm going to sleep.

1163
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,800
I'm embarrassed.

1164
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,600
I'm going to sleep.

1165
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,840
Do you want to watch it?

1166
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,340
Yes, let's watch it together.

1167
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,640
Let's watch it together.

1168
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:30,030
She is very serious.

1169
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,031
What are you doing?

1170
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,910
It's embarrassing.

1171
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:46,780
How do I look? Beautiful.

1172
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,060


1173
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,260
Beautiful?

1174
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:53,850
What do you want to see?

1175
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:59,120
Do you want me to
lick you? Let's do it.

1176
01:24:59,121 --> 01:25:00,121
Watch me.

1177
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,220


1178
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:18,260
Wow!

1179
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,540
Why are you so good
at it? It feels good.

1180
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,860


1181
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,641
Because you are older than me.

1182
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,920
It feels so good.

1183
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,780
It feels so good there.

1184
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,950
Wait a minute.

1185
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:53,970
Did you say it? I'll change.

1186
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,250


1187
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:57,950
Change?

1188
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:00,350
I'll pet you, too.

1189
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:07,130
Look.

1190
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,290
It's a python.

1191
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,650
Look, look.

1192
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:13,330
Great.

1193
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:17,450
Here.

1194
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:18,910
Yes, there.

1195
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,630
You look like you feel good.

1196
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,400
Wow, your tongue is warm.

1197
01:26:41,365 --> 01:26:45,320
Wow, my stomach hurts.

1198
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:46,080
It's soft.

1199
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:47,740
It's deep, isn't it?

1200
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:50,960
Here? Yes, here.

1201
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,460
It feels good.

1202
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,440


1203
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:02,840
It feels good, doesn't it?

1204
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,960
You are twitching.

1205
01:27:20,555 --> 01:27:23,880
It feels good.

1206
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:26,960
You look like you're in a good mood.

1207
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,580
Oh, there.

1208
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,480
Wow.

1209
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,280
It's getting sunny, isn't it?

1210
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:38,520
Yes.

1211
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,460
Your cheeks, too.

1212
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,320
Oh, it feels good.

1213
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,460
There.

1214
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:49,680
Oh, the tip of my tongue feels good.

1215
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,080
I'm sorry.

1216
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,560
I don't know if I can do
it, but I'm going to do it.

1217
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,960
I can't do it.

1218
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,920
I'm going to cry.

1219
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,530
Your voice is cracking.

1220
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,730
It's gone.

1221
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,210
Tomo-kun.

1222
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,750
Yes.

1223
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:49,000
You can see both of them
well, can't you? You're all wet.

1224
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:54,290


1225
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,071
Tama-kun, which one
do you want to put it in?

1226
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,840
Can I put it in?

1227
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,640
Both of you are so wet.

1228
01:29:04,641 --> 01:29:05,641
It's in there.

1229
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:12,190
You can touch it.

1230
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,380
Put your finger in it.

1231
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,340
Where does it come
from? It's in there.

1232
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,470
It feels good.

1233
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:41,460
I'm surprised.

1234
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,420
It feels good.

1235
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,480


1236
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,690
Both of them feel good.

1237
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:01,790
Tomo-kun's eyes are open.

1238
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:04,210
It feels good.

1239
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:09,090
Oh, no.

1240
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,330
Tomo-kun's eyes are open.

1241
01:30:17,185 --> 01:30:19,750
Oh, it hurts.

1242
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:23,470
Tomoko, doesn't your
finger feel good? It feels good.

1243
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:24,990
It hurts a lot.

1244
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:30,290
It feels good.

1245
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:35,030
Don't do that.

1246
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,510


1247
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:56,660
Itch! Oh, it's heavy.

1248
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,270
I feel sick.

1249
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:24,850


1250
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:26,590
I feel a little sick.

1251
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,720
Oh, it's heavy.

1252
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:43,920
Oh, you are trembling.

1253
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,220
I feel sick.

1254
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,840
It's heavy.

1255
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,630
Itch, do you feel sick?

1256
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:15,930
You are licking me.

1257
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,690
Do you feel good? Touch here.

1258
01:32:23,965 --> 01:32:26,070


1259
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,880
Do you feel good?

1260
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,020
Do you feel good? Let's go.

1261
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,600
You are brave.

1262
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,050


1263
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:06,590
No!

1264
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:26,330
I'll open it for you.

1265
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:37,770
No, no, no.

1266
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,320
You are too strong.

1267
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,320
Don't lose.

1268
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,720
Let's go.

1269
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,480
Let's go.

1270
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,720
Tana-chan, please lick me.

1271
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:17,260
Does it feel so good?

1272
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,840
It feels so good.

1273
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,440
I can't do it.

1274
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:30,980
You can put on some weight.

1275
01:35:41,305 --> 01:35:43,740
I can't stand up.

1276
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,300
You can't stand up.

1277
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:01,140
Oh, no!

1278
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:07,020
Oh, no!

1279
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,740
You lick me well.

1280
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:48,030
Do you want to go?

1281
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:20,710
You went away while licking me.

1282
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:33,170
I'm going to lick you from this side.

1283
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,571
I'm going to lick you from this side.

1284
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:52,451
I'm going to lick you from this side.

1285
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:58,870
It feels good, doesn't it?

1286
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:07,190
You want to be licked, don't you?

1287
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:14,130
It feels good, doesn't
it? I'm so sleepy.

1288
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:42,570
I can't do it.

1289
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:44,290
I can't do it.

1290
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:45,650
I can't do it.

1291
01:38:45,651 --> 01:38:45,710
I can't do it.

1292
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:46,711
I can't do it.

1293
01:38:46,875 --> 01:39:05,330
Let's do it.

1294
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:10,670


1295
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:16,010
I'll do it, too.

1296
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:29,810
I want you to touch me, too.

1297
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:33,980
Where is it? It feels good.

1298
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:51,660


1299
01:40:28,865 --> 01:40:30,180
I'm not going to run away.

1300
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:32,260
I don't want to.

1301
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,180
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

1302
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,000
You want to put it in
next, don't you? Well.

1303
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:00,240
..

1304
01:41:00,241 --> 01:41:01,241
Which one?

1305
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:18,220
You want to put it in, don't you?

1306
01:41:18,835 --> 01:41:20,676
Have you decided which
one you want to put in? Well.

1307
01:41:21,365 --> 01:41:22,780
..

1308
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,760
Well... What?
Which one? It's OK.

1309
01:41:24,761 --> 01:41:25,761


1310
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:28,690
You can't choose? I'm sorry.

1311
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,090


1312
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:37,280
I have to make sure it's your sister.

1313
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,620
It's unfair.

1314
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,160
It's really me.

1315
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:44,791
Look at the place to put it.

1316
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:52,640
I'm going to put it in.

1317
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,240
Wow.

1318
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,760
I'm going to put it in.

1319
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,280
Wow, it's so thick.

1320
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,120
Does it feel good?

1321
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:05,380
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

1322
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,820
It's nice.

1323
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:07,900


1324
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:10,580
I can see that it's so much in there.

1325
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,620
Wow.

1326
01:42:12,621 --> 01:42:13,860
It's amazing.

1327
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,080
It's good, isn't
it? It feels good.

1328
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:19,100


1329
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,840
Do you want to go
home? It feels good.

1330
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:25,180
This side, too.

1331
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:30,480


1332
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,760
It feels good, doesn't it?

1333
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,960
Your nipples, too.

1334
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,520
Get up.

1335
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,460
I can't stop you.

1336
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,140
I can't stop you.

1337
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:07,040
I can't stop you.

1338
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:09,780
Mei-chan.

1339
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:24,950
Mei-chan.

1340
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:26,790
Good.

1341
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,830
This part is dangerous,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

1342
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:36,200


1343
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:39,310
You look like you feel good.

1344
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:43,230
I feel good, too.

1345
01:43:43,231 --> 01:43:43,930
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

1346
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:45,651
Do you feel good
inside? Yes, I do.

1347
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,810
I feel good, too.

1348
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:53,930
Do you feel good, too?

1349
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:55,620
How do you feel, Tomo-kun?

1350
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:10,560
You shouldn't move, Tomoki-chan.

1351
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,620
Oh, no!

1352
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,880
Wow, you're twitching.

1353
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,680
Don't pull it out.

1354
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:35,760
Oh!

1355
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,680
Can you do it? Yes, I can.

1356
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:39,960
Here we go.

1357
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:40,800


1358
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,420
Oh!

1359
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:44,410
It's flipped over.

1360
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,780
Oh, it's out of the way.

1361
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:46,700
Oh, it's out of the way.

1362
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:47,700
Do you want to try?

1363
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,760
OK.

1364
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:51,190
Where is it?

1365
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Here? Oh, it's there.

1366
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,320
Oh, it's in.

1367
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,580


1368
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,980
Oh, it feels good.

1369
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,420
Look, look.

1370
01:45:01,421 --> 01:45:03,560
You can see the inside of the stomach.

1371
01:45:04,525 --> 01:45:05,880
You are eating a lot.

1372
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:13,770
You look comfortable.

1373
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:20,960
I want you to touch me, too.

1374
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:52,750
You have a lot of hair.

1375
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,820
I want to go home soon.

1376
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,140
No.

1377
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:13,740
Why? You should go home soon.

1378
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,420
You have a lot of hair.

1379
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:20,700
It feels good.

1380
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,000
Touch me more.

1381
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,180
OK.

1382
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:28,000
I'm sorry.

1383
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,700
I can't.

1384
01:46:31,701 --> 01:47:00,490
I'm sorry.

1385
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:21,040
Your legs are shaking.

1386
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,700
It's unfair that you have a lot of hair.

1387
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:38,380
Are you going to do it?

1388
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:41,160
I'm going to do it!

1389
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:42,850
Wow!

1390
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:45,360
You're amazing!

1391
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,960
I can't do it anymore.

1392
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:50,940
It feels so good.

1393
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:54,300
I want to go to bed early.

1394
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:57,491
I want to go to bed early.

1395
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,800
Here.

1396
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:05,700
Are you going to
ride it? It's amazing.

1397
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,540
It's amazing.

1398
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:18,780


1399
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:21,400
It's coming in from above.

1400
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,080
It looks like it's going
to make a lot of noise.

1401
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:33,940
Don't do that.

1402
01:48:35,255 --> 01:48:36,360
It feels good.

1403
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:44,140
It feels good.

1404
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:54,370
Oh, no.

1405
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:56,210
I feel like I'm going to puke.

1406
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:02,050
I feel like I'm going to puke.

1407
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:05,230
Go, go, go.

1408
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:14,520
It feels good.

1409
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:18,180
Go, go, go!

1410
01:49:25,645 --> 01:49:29,930
It feels so good.

1411
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:32,250
I want more.

1412
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,040
Oh, it feels good.

1413
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,120
What were you doing just now?

1414
01:50:20,121 --> 01:50:20,960
Did you find out? Yes, I did.

1415
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,660
It feels good.

1416
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:34,200


1417
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,320
Please lick me a lot.

1418
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:45,060
Oh, it feels good.

1419
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:50,760
Oh, you feel good, too.

1420
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:05,000
Did you want to be touched, Tama-kun?

1421
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:10,640
Oh, your waist is moving.

1422
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,900
I'm sorry.

1423
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:20,190
I'm sorry.

1424
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I can't do it.

1425
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:25,150
I feel so good.

1426
01:51:25,710 --> 01:52:06,380
I want to do it.

1427
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:27,930
I'm sorry.

1428
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:37,510
Wow! It's white!

1429
01:52:39,110 --> 01:52:40,590
Something came out.

1430
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:42,350
Wow!

1431
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:45,190
Sushi?

1432
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,490
Wow!

1433
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:51,050
It came out!

1434
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:52,350
Did it come out?

1435
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:53,450
It came out!

1436
01:52:53,610 --> 01:52:54,610
Wow!

1437
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:56,390
It came out a
lot! It feels good.

1438
01:52:57,870 --> 01:53:00,210


1439
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:02,810
Do you lick it?

1440
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:04,170
Yes.

1441
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:06,170
Yes.

1442
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:07,910
You're a gentleman.

1443
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:09,150
I'm scared.

1444
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:10,250
You're scary.

1445
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:12,990
Tama-kun, did you take
out your stomach? I'm sorry.

1446
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:14,630
It felt good.

1447
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:17,290
It's painful.

1448
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:18,670


1449
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:21,261
Kana-chan, why don't
you take out your stomach?

1450
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:22,990
Can you still do it?

1451
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:23,830
Can you?

1452
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:25,470
You can, right?

1453
01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:27,390
You can, right?

1454
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:28,730
You can still do it, right?

1455
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:30,710
You can do it at all.

1456
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,510
Because you have a big belly.

1457
01:53:32,511 --> 01:53:34,350
I'm going to put it in.

1458
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:37,650
Hana.

1459
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:39,830
Yes.

1460
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:42,090
Wow.

1461
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:48,710
Wow, it's in.

1462
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:50,970
Wow.

1463
01:53:52,805 --> 01:53:56,010
Move a lot.

1464
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,420
It feels good.

1465
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,020
It feels good.

1466
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,680
It feels good for me, too.

1467
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,220
Oh, it's hard.

1468
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,860
Does it feel good?

1469
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,040
It's getting hard.

1470
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:37,041
It's hard.

1471
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,500
It's only tomorrow.

1472
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,880
It feels good.

1473
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:48,060
No, it feels good.

1474
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:49,980
It's cut.

1475
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,240
It's cut.

1476
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,120
It's amazing.

1477
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,700
It's amazing.

1478
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,680
It's growing.

1479
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,680
It feels good.

1480
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,600
Does it feel good?

1481
01:55:03,601 --> 01:55:04,601
Can you see it?

1482
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,340
Can you see it? I can see it.

1483
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,400


1484
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:09,501
I can see the part where
you have a lot of sweat.

1485
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:14,100
Wow.

1486
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,120
Wow.

1487
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,500
I feel so good.

1488
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:20,590
You have a lot of sweat.

1489
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:27,800
You have a lot of sweat.

1490
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:30,480
I'll go.

1491
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:31,380
You'll go?

1492
01:55:31,381 --> 01:55:32,381
I'm going to die!

1493
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:44,000
Your butt is twitching.

1494
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,620
I can't do it anymore.

1495
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Wow! Do it again.

1496
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,160
Do it again.

1497
01:55:55,925 --> 01:55:57,800
It feels good.

1498
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,600
Do it again.

1499
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:03,400


1500
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:12,470
Oh, no!

1501
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,870
Oh, no!

1502
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:28,750
Tomoko is moving more and more.

1503
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:31,870
Oh, no!

1504
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,660
Your face is so cute.

1505
01:56:46,445 --> 01:56:47,740
Oh, no!

1506
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:49,460
What should I do?

1507
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:50,760
Is it over? No, not yet.

1508
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:52,380
Stand up.

1509
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:52,980


1510
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,280
OK.

1511
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,660
Does it feel good?

1512
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,420
It feels good! Look at me.

1513
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:17,840


1514
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:55,010
Wow! You are trembling.

1515
01:57:58,550 --> 01:58:00,170
Let me hold you.

1516
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:24,900
Wow!

1517
01:58:24,901 --> 01:58:25,901
It's so soft!

1518
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Wow!

1519
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:31,560
Wow!

1520
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,400
It's amazing,
isn't it? Yes, it is.

1521
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:33,540


1522
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:56,920
I can see your hands.

1523
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,520
Wow!

1524
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:01,900
Really?

1525
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:05,620
It feels so good!

1526
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:15,310
Oh, no! You dropped it.

1527
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:18,430


1528
01:59:24,515 --> 01:59:26,120
Can I take it out? Yes, you can.

1529
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:29,400


1530
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:30,900
I took it out, didn't
I? Yes, you did.

1531
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,780


1532
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:36,540
You look very comfortable.

1533
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:38,500
Yes, I do.

1534
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:39,820
That's good.

1535
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:45,530
Great.

1536
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:00,120
Wow!

1537
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:07,720
Let me touch your nose.

1538
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:11,700
※She's not crying.

1539
02:00:11,701 --> 02:00:12,701
It's ticklish.

1540
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:34,050
It's ticklish.

1541
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,080
It's ticklish.

1542
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:58,740
It's ticklish.

1543
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:10,520
It's coming out.

1544
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:14,920
It's very dark. It's pure white.

1545
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,240
It's coming out a lot.

1546
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,240
It's coming out a lot.

1547
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:21,740
It's amazing.

1548
02:01:21,741 --> 02:01:23,421
The white one is coming out more and more.

1549
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:26,430
Tomo-kun.

1550
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:27,960
Yes.

1551
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,320
Which one is next?

1552
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:38,791
Today, I'm going to do it only for a day
because my mom and dad are not here.

1553
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,080
Let's do it once.

1554
02:01:43,705 --> 02:01:45,080
Which one do you like next?

1555
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:47,830
I like this one.

1556
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:49,480
Me again?

1557
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:51,120
No.

1558
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:52,540
That's not fair.

1559
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:54,380
I like this one.
