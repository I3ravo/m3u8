1
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,790
I remember a little while ago.

2
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:04,325
I remember when I was with my
childhood friend whom I loved so much.

3
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,110
He was a joker, a
playboy, but a kind person.

4
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,320
At that time, I couldn't
say I loved him honestly.

5
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,890
He seemed close, but he was far away.

6
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,340
As time went by, another hot season came.

7
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm home!

8
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,500
You're so cute!

9
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,900
It was the last summer vacation of my
college life, so I came back to my hometown.

10
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,100
After graduating from high
school, I studied abroad.

11
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
I still have a bit of
self-deprecation left in me.

12
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,961
While I was studying, I
couldn't go back to my

13
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:34,800
hometown because I was
too busy with my research.

14
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,490
But there are other reasons
why I couldn't go back.

15
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,982
It's because I have
a younger childhood

16
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,856
friend, Mai, who is two
years younger than me.

17
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,730
So, what's the story?

18
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,650
Well...

19
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,410
I haven't told you yet, but... What? I
said I wouldn't hang out with Masumi.

20
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,630
Oh, I see.

21
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,970
What do you mean, I see?

22
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,910
Oh...

23
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,510
Well...

24
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,450
Do you like me?

25
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,450
What?

26
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,810
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:36,940
What? What's wrong?

28
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,550
That's enough. I don't like you.

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,370
You don't understand how I feel at all.

30
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,850
Hey.

31
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,711
I wanted to tell Mai how I felt
before I went to study abroad.

32
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,310
I was embarrassed, so I
wrote only my feelings in a letter.

33
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,456
I hesitated to give her the letter.

34
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,270
I couldn't chase Mai.

35
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:15,430
I couldn't say anything to Mai, and I
left Japan without saying anything to Mai.

36
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,110
Because of the light, Mai
looked a little more mature.

37
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,290
Here you are.

38
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Thank you.

39
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,730
Why are you in my house?

40
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,820
I came to deliver vegetables to Mr. Ikumi.

41
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,271
Then he told me that Sakuni was there.

42
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
I see.

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,601
Saku-nii, you're still as sleepy as ever.

44
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,851
You've been calling girls by their names.

45
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Like Michiko.

46
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,440
Huh? Who's Michiko?

47
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm just kidding.

48
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,360
You don't change when you get serious.

49
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,040
Don't come here again.

50
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,091
By the way, you're going
to get a job in Tokyo.

51
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,360
Oh, I knew that.

52
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,920
Of course you did.

53
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,340
I know. The only thing that
matters is that you're smart.

54
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
What's that?

55
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,660
What are you doing now? What about school?

56
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,180
I can't go to school. You know I'm poor.

57
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,770
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,210
I wanted you to tell me that
you're going to study abroad.

59
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,571
It was a long time ago, wasn't it?

60
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,690
Yeah, I guess so.

61
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:00,010
But it's all right. It's all in the past.

62
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,420
You know, the atmosphere
has changed, hasn't it?

63
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
How should I put it?

64
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
I don't know.

65
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,260
I've grown up, too.

66
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,980
In a place where I don't know Sakuni.

67
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,820
No, it's nothing.

68
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,821
No, I haven't.

69
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,110
What did you put away?

70
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Nothing.

71
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,630
I've always loved you.

72
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,550
I put away the letter I wanted to give you.

73
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,170
I wanted to tell you that I love you.

74
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:31,710
Sakuni, what's wrong?

75
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:32,711
Why all of a sudden?

76
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,370
Mai.

77
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,610
I like you.

78
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
I couldn't tell you.

79
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,550
Never mind.

80
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:53,210
Let me do it.

81
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,940
Let me see your ear.

82
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,750
Does it look good?

83
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:48,680
I wanted to do this.

84
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
I'm sorry.

85
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Show me more.

86
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm embarrassed to see you like that.

87
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Does it hurt?

88
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,520
It feels good.

89
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,320
Ah, it's so hot.

90
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,890
Ah, it's so hot.

91
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,730
Ah, I can't. I'm going to go again.

92
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
I can't go there.

93
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
You're sweating a lot.

94
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,510
Does it feel good?

95
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:40,740
Does it feel good?

96
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:29,450
I'm sorry.

97
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,550
It feels good.

98
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,410
It feels good.

99
00:34:54,690 --> 00:36:25,360
Are you okay?

100
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,750
I want to do it again.

101
00:37:27,910 --> 00:41:10,840
I want to do it again.

102
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:49,850
I want to do it again.

103
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,870
I want to do it again.

104
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,800
I'm sorry.

105
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,890
You don't have to apologize.

106
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,220
I like you.

107
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:13,910
Thank you.

108
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,520
I'll be here until the 5th of August.

109
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,671
Can I see you during that time?

110
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
The 5th?

111
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,260
Yeah.

112
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,690
Do you have anything planned for the 5th?

113
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,130
No, nothing.

114
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,050
What do you think?

115
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,691
Well, if it's just a little...

116
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

117
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:12,665
Time stopped.

118
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,470
But Mayu didn't know if she liked me.

119
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,240
Let's eat.

120
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,640
It's good.

121
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Is it cold?

122
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,300
It's good.

123
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,900
It's been a while.

124
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,490
How many years has it been
since I ate watermelon with Saku-nii?

125
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,530
It's been a long time.

126
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,790
It's delicious.

127
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,170
Hey, Saku-nii.

128
00:50:02,930 --> 00:51:09,750
Does it feel good?

129
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,170
It feels good.

130
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,620
It's slimy.

131
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,611
Which part is the most pleasant?

132
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,330
I don't know.

133
00:55:58,805 --> 00:56:01,900
Next, Asakura-kun,
please sleep on this bed.

134
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,650
I'm nervous.

135
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:13,910
I'll pour it for you.

136
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,110
What's wrong?

137
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,610
No, no, no.

138
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,950
It's going to spill.

139
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,470
Can you open your eyes?

140
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,330
Not yet.

141
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,730
I can't stand it.

142
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,220
I'm nervous.

143
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,960
Not yet?

144
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
Not yet.

145
00:58:31,825 --> 00:58:33,190
Hang in there.

146
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,470
It was heavy.

147
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,330
Are you ready?

148
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:14,740
Can I take it out?

149
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,540
No, not yet.

150
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,020
Why?

151
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,060
It's going to burst.

152
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Can I?

153
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,400
It's going to burst.

154
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:30,401
I'm going to throw up.

155
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,300
Not yet.

156
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,500
Hang in there.

157
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:51,580
Does it feel good?

158
01:00:56,835 --> 01:00:57,530
Hang in there.

159
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:58,531
What about this time?

160
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,410
I want to take it out.

161
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,270
I can't.

162
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:02,810
Do you want to take it out?

163
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,170
I want to take it out.

164
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,450
It can't be helped.

165
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,150
It's okay.

166
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,210
Is it okay?

167
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,430
Yes.

168
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,726
I want you to do it with your mouth.

169
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,750
With my mouth?

170
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,510
I'm about to throw up.

171
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,680
I'm really going to throw up.

172
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,550
I'm going to throw up.

173
01:02:37,630 --> 01:03:08,620
I feel like I'm going back
to the old days a little bit.

174
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,040
I wonder if that's the case.

175
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,290
What kind of place is it?

176
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,540
I don't know.

177
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,760
Oh, you smile a lot.

178
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,610
What's that?

179
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,980
I know. You don't have an umbrella today.

180
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,260
What should I do?

181
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
It's fine.

182
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,760
Aren't you going out?

183
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
No, I'm fine.

184
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,200
I'll go home today.

185
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,040
I'll text you later.

186
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,920
Oh, okay. I'll text you later.

187
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:59,600
No, it's okay. I'll text you later.

188
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:38,820
What were you doing so late at night?

189
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,360
I'm sorry.

190
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:47,280
You didn't answer my question.

191
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:52,180
No, I didn't.
I asked you what you were doing.

192
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:55,991
I was making tea at my friend's house.

193
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,300
You're so bad at lying that it's funny.

194
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:11,340
Hey, do you think it's okay to be silent?

195
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:13,820
I'm sorry.

196
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:15,640
No, I'm not.

197
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,280
I'm so sick of you.

198
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,440
To be honest,

199
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:25,840
if I told you that I had
sex with my ex-girlfriend,

200
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:29,875
I would forgive you.

201
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,160
Right?

202
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,160
Why do you say that?

203
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:44,170
You know, You know, the
countryside is a narrow world.

204
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:50,370
That's why I hate animals
that act without thinking.

205
01:05:54,790 --> 01:06:00,290
Hey, there's a wedding coming
up the day after tomorrow.

206
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:07,090
From now on, you're going to
be the rightful heir to the throne.

207
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:16,010
Think about what you
lack and act accordingly.

208
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,970
You're trying to be my wife.

209
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:26,730
That's unresistive.

210
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,270
You're a fool.

211
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:37,470
If I get serious,

212
01:06:41,715 --> 01:06:43,440
I can crush you easily.

213
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:52,390
I'm sorry.

214
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,020
I won't do that again.

215
01:06:56,021 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm sorry.
So please don't do anything to Sakurini.

216
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,540
Don't hurt the one you love.

217
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,380
Please. I'll do anything.

218
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,220
Are you sure?

219
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
Yes.

220
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,300
I'm looking forward to it.

221
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,840
Follow me.

222
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,680
Hey, what are you doing?

223
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,700
Hurry up and get up.

224
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,880
Hey.

225
01:07:38,881 --> 01:08:07,610
I'll show you exactly how to do it.

226
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,591
I'll show you exactly how to do it.

227
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,520
Mai.

228
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:30,180
I'll show you how to do it.

229
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,620
One is what your face likes.

230
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,371
What do you think the other one is?

231
01:08:48,635 --> 01:08:50,950
That's...

232
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
Erosion.

233
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,650
You know...

234
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:05,990
You've been screaming in your
heart that you want to have sex.

235
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,250
That's right.

236
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,330
She's a woman who sleeps
with another man right away.

237
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:26,080
Hey, do something.

238
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:39,080
You said you didn't
want to be in love with me.

239
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:48,900
You keep saying you don't want to do it,
but you're making Maoko mad, aren't you?

240
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,440
That's the proof.

241
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,300
Let's do it.

242
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,320
The sex you like.

243
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,840
Show me your tongue.

244
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,780
Show me more.

245
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:05,160
Look at me.

246
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,620
If you don't feel good,

247
01:11:08,245 --> 01:11:09,446
You have to say it feels good.

248
01:11:12,705 --> 01:11:14,706
I don't care what happens
to your beloved brother.

249
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:39,130
You really want to make a sound, don't you?

250
01:12:43,230 --> 01:13:15,680
Have you ever done such
a nasty look in front of him?

251
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,540
How is it?

252
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:30,100
No, I don't.

253
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,220
I see.

254
01:13:34,615 --> 01:13:35,780
You don't have it.

255
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:43,140
Then I'll make you feel
good until you scream.

256
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,130
No, you can't.

257
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,470
You're trying to sleep
on your own, aren't you?

258
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,000
No, you can't.

259
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:19,400
Hey, you want me to
let you live, don't you?

260
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,180
Please.

261
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:27,070
Let me live.

262
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,250
More.

263
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,190
Let me live.

264
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:33,630
Please let me go.

265
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,850
More!

266
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,530
Please let me go.

267
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,440
You're the one who said that.

268
01:17:18,060 --> 01:18:19,010
I'm fine.

269
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,380
Go.

270
01:19:02,381 --> 01:19:04,640
You are crazy.

271
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,080
It hurts.

272
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,520
You don't have to cry anymore.

273
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,200
What's wrong with you?

274
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,140
What's wrong with you?

275
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:49,610
No, no.

276
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:23,590
Do you like being licked?

277
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,260
She likes being licked.

278
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,060
I'm sorry.

279
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,780
I'm sorry.

280
01:22:33,450 --> 01:23:03,960
I'll take care of it.

281
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:55,290
I'm going to give it to you.

282
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,590
You like this, don't you?

283
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,640
Don't let go of it.

284
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:03,400
I'll lick yours, so lick mine.

285
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,860
Can you do it?

286
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,620
Open your eyes.

287
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,940
Open your eyes.

288
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:42,101
I'm going to put you in here.

289
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,060
I'm going to put you in here.

290
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,750
I want you to put me in here.

291
01:27:51,775 --> 01:27:53,590
Don't do it, please.

292
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,100
I love you so much.

293
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:29,450
If you can't say it, beg me more.

294
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,950
Don't do it, please.

295
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:47,070
You don't want to have sex, do you?

296
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:49,470
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.

297
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:58,300
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

298
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:00,440
You're so big.

299
01:29:01,895 --> 01:29:03,780
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

300
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,240
I'll show you.

301
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:59,740
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

302
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:28,561
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

303
01:30:48,290 --> 01:31:24,700
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh Ahhhhhhhhh
Come on, pull yourself up.

304
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:47,900
Next, the other side.

305
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,360
Does it feel good?

306
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:24,850
Yes, it feels good.

307
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:26,020
Shout more.

308
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:28,290
It feels good.

309
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:29,540
Shout more.

310
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:44,840
You like to be hit like this, don't you?

311
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:52,980
It's an animal, so walk like an animal.

312
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:47,420
Who the hell are you?

313
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,640
Who the hell are you?

314
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:02,040
Akira-San.

315
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:06,230
Who?

316
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:09,130
Akira-San.

317
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:10,710
That's right.

318
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:19,050
Akira-San.

319
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,850
Ah...

320
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:48,680
Come on, scream more.

321
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,321
I can't... I can't.

322
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,340
Ah...

323
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,240
Is Sakuni here?

324
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,000
Oh, what are you doing in my room?

325
01:47:11,001 --> 01:47:12,001
What are you doing there?

326
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:15,620
Come on, get up.

327
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:24,150
Stay where you are. Don't look this way.

328
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:29,580
What's wrong?

329
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:36,800
I can't see Saku-nii anymore.

330
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,040
From now on.

331
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,880
What's wrong?

332
01:47:42,881 --> 01:47:43,881
Why all of a sudden?

333
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:47,900
I've been keeping it from you.

334
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:51,410
What?

335
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:56,060
I'm going to marry Akira Saionji.

336
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,370
What?

337
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:04,490
What?

338
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:07,740
I'm sorry, Sakuni.

339
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:11,340
I was happy to see you after a long time.

340
01:48:12,715 --> 01:48:14,240
I wish I could see you earlier.

341
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:16,420
I'm sorry.

342
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,321
I couldn't keep up with her.

343
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:26,220
I couldn't help it.

344
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:30,620
I hadn't grown up since then.

345
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:02,730
Why are you getting ready to go home?

346
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:03,811
What are you talking about?

347
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:06,750
It's Mai's wedding, isn't it?

348
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,310
Yes, it seems so.

349
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:11,650
What are you talking about?

350
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:15,290
I have nothing to do with it.

351
01:49:16,395 --> 01:49:18,030
I'm glad I got married to a rich man.

352
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:21,810
What are you talking about?

353
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:24,610
Look at this.

354
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,970
What's this?

355
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:28,690
Go.

356
01:49:28,691 --> 01:49:32,710
Look at you. You like Mai-chan, don't you?

357
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:35,050
Why do I have to listen to my mom?

358
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:39,210
You left her behind when she was a student.

359
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,081
Why are you looking at me like that?

360
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:46,910
It doesn't matter. It's over.

361
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:48,831
How long are you going to be a kid?

362
01:49:51,305 --> 01:49:52,305
What do you want to do?

363
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:58,210
Why don't you try to be hot
for someone else like a fool?

364
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:03,550
Come on, go ahead.

365
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:28,177
Well, it's just a rumor,
but Mai-chan's house

366
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:32,510
is in trouble with a
lot of money, isn't it?

367
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:38,830
There is a rumor that Mai tries to make her
parents happy and refuses to get married.

368
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:16,710
Come with me Come with me.

369
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:24,260
Come with me.

370
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:36,740
Remaining snow is shimmering.

371
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,151
This is the first time I've
heard of it, so I'm not sure if

372
01:52:03,163 --> 01:52:05,140
it's a good thing or a bad
thing, but I think it's a good thing.

373
01:52:05,141 --> 01:52:08,341
I don't know if it's a good thing or a
bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

374
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:16,280
I don't know if it's a good thing or a
bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

375
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,880
I don't know if it's a good thing or a
bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

376
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,920
I don't know what to do with my life.

377
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:12,350
Mai!

378
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:19,740
Oh, this is Saku from Hirajima.

379
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:25,720
What happened to your club? Go home.

380
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,000
Hey, you guys!

381
01:53:30,730 --> 01:53:32,120
I'm here to save Mai.

382
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:34,640
From this stupid wedding.

383
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:35,641
I love you.

384
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:37,050
Cut it out!

385
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:38,820
Who the hell are you?

386
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,500
Come here, Mai.

387
01:53:41,335 --> 01:53:42,335
I won't run away anymore.

388
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:43,780
I love you.

389
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:46,600
I want to be with you.

390
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,300
You're really beautiful.

391
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,480
Congratulations.

392
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,260
Thank you.

393
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:25,830
Mai, wait.

394
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:29,650
You don't have to get married.

395
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:33,180
Don't worry about us.

396
01:54:37,810 --> 01:54:44,130
Mai, marriage is not for someone.
It's for yourself. For your own happiness.

397
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:47,351
What are you talking about?

398
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:51,730
Mai, tell me the truth.

399
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:24,810
I've always loved you. I still love you.
You're the best in the world.

400
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:29,270
I won't lie anymore.
I'll be honest with myself.

401
01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:36,090
Me too.
I love you from the bottom of my heart.

402
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:50,130
That's funny.

403
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:55,890
That's a good one, Mai.

404
01:55:56,290 --> 01:56:02,160
Don't make it easy for me to listen to you.

405
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,940
Are you against me?

406
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,780
Don't you have a human mind?

407
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,280
You're like an animal.

408
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:18,280
I won't listen to your orders anymore.

409
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:19,860
Let go of this dirty hand.

410
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,360
You!

411
01:56:23,361 --> 01:56:24,361
Shut up!

412
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,480
I'll decide my own life.

413
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:28,980
I've already decided.

414
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,500
Mai, come here. Hurry up.

415
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,320
What are you waiting for?

416
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,160
Hurry up and get the ice cream.

417
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:39,660
Yes, sir.

418
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:02,420
I...

419
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:10,230
Hurry up and put it in.

420
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:31,120
I don't want to use a cup.

421
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:37,420
What do you want me to do?

422
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:39,880
I want you to give me a kiss.

423
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,760
Is it delicious?

424
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:00,700
Yes, it's delicious.

425
02:18:00,701 --> 02:18:05,700
I want that one, too.

426
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,120
It's good.

427
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:27,380
I'll give it to you.

428
02:18:30,570 --> 02:18:31,750
Put it in your mouth.

429
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:52,860
Can you eat it?

430
02:18:56,990 --> 02:19:18,350
I want you to eat it.

431
02:19:18,351 --> 02:19:19,351
I want you to sleep.

432
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:22,430
Please give me a warm hug.

433
02:24:21,290 --> 02:26:14,340
I want to do it more.

434
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:44,440
I can't do it anymore.

435
02:34:17,230 --> 02:37:05,660
I can't do it anymore.

436
02:37:05,661 --> 02:37:06,661
I want to go home.

437
02:40:19,450 --> 02:40:21,510
What is your favorite food?

438
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:25,970
I like Sushi.

439
02:40:26,990 --> 02:40:37,040
Thank you for your hard work.

440
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:39,420
What is this?

441
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:40,760
Thank you for your hard work.

442
02:40:40,761 --> 02:40:41,921
Thank you for your hard work.

443
02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:43,380
I also have alcohol.

444
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:48,260
You can eat and drink whatever you like.

445
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Yes.

446
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:51,200
What is your favorite food?

447
02:40:52,930 --> 02:40:56,520
My favorite food is... I like
tomatoes the most in the world.

448
02:40:57,100 --> 02:40:58,240
But I ate too much.

449
02:40:58,770 --> 02:40:59,800
If I ate like every day,

450
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:01,440
I would have a heart attack.

451
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:04,520
Yes.

452
02:41:05,770 --> 02:41:07,060
I thought you liked it, so I bought a lot.

453
02:41:07,061 --> 02:41:08,141
I've been waiting for this.

454
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:09,600
Almond.

455
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:14,360
I'll have this.

456
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:19,580
Can I really drink this?

457
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:20,880
Of course.

458
02:41:24,510 --> 02:41:26,150
I'm sorry. I'm drinking alone.

459
02:41:26,970 --> 02:41:27,970
Cheers.

460
02:41:28,570 --> 02:41:29,730
Thank you for your hard work.

461
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:38,280
It's delicious.

462
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:40,180
It's been a while since I drank this.

463
02:41:44,430 --> 02:41:47,350
If you don't mind, I'd like you to eat
your favorite sweets and desserts.

464
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:50,540
Cororo.

465
02:41:51,140 --> 02:41:52,140
Cororo.

466
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:54,100
What is this?

467
02:41:56,010 --> 02:42:00,560
I'm sorry, I forgot to explain.

468
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:12,080
There is an instruction on the back, and if
you do it, you can eat anything you like.

469
02:42:13,415 --> 02:42:14,415
I see.

470
02:42:15,455 --> 02:42:16,600
Can I eat this?

471
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:18,940
It's safe, so please.

472
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:20,200
I'll eat it.

473
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:22,740
I like corn the most in Gumi.

474
02:42:22,741 --> 02:42:23,741
It's like this.

475
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:28,900
It's good.

476
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:33,220
What should I do with this?

477
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:37,740
I can't decide because there are too many.

478
02:42:39,380 --> 02:42:40,380
What should I do?

479
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:43,440
This?

480
02:42:50,820 --> 02:42:51,820
What are you writing?

481
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:53,180
It's a phone call.

482
02:42:53,380 --> 02:43:02,220
If you do that, you can eat it.

483
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:03,900
Excuse me.

484
02:44:12,415 --> 02:44:14,960
You can eat what you like.

485
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:17,520
This crab?

486
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:19,680
Of course.

487
02:44:22,345 --> 02:44:29,090
I prepared a lot of rewards for you.

488
02:44:29,290 --> 02:44:35,100
I want to eat it, so I want to choose it.

489
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:51,140
I'm nervous.

490
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:57,370
What should I do?

491
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:01,740
This is it.

492
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:05,440
It's a toy.

493
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:08,330
Isn't it strong?

494
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:25,370
Ah, wait.

495
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:36,650
The back is dangerous.

496
02:47:37,890 --> 02:47:45,540
I was hit for the first time.

497
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:50,740
Which one should I choose?

498
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:52,380
This one.

499
02:47:53,880 --> 02:47:55,980
I'm going to paint one piece of clothing.

500
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:16,600
I have a sore neck.

501
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:31,200
I'm embarrassed.

502
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:35,010
I'm embarrassed.

503
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:41,740
Do you like sweets?

504
02:48:44,020 --> 02:48:50,280
I eat a lot, but I don't
have any new sweets.

505
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:54,200
I eat everything.

506
02:49:30,890 --> 02:49:31,930
Is it delicious?

507
02:49:33,850 --> 02:49:35,110
Yes, it's delicious.

508
02:50:07,700 --> 02:50:08,730
The cream is delicious.

509
02:50:20,970 --> 02:50:31,750
I'm sorry, I can't say it.

510
02:51:11,370 --> 02:51:13,360
It's still moving.

511
02:51:18,130 --> 02:51:19,130
Dango.

512
02:51:20,550 --> 02:51:21,550
It's cool.

513
02:51:23,320 --> 02:51:24,320
It's a rotor!

514
02:51:24,810 --> 02:51:26,050
It was a rotor.

515
02:51:26,051 --> 02:51:27,051
Thank you very much.

516
02:51:29,050 --> 02:51:30,050
Double?

517
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:07,190
You can eat it.

518
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:34,600
Mai-San, there are still a lot.

519
02:57:36,705 --> 02:57:37,705
I couldn't eat at all.

520
02:57:38,980 --> 02:57:40,020
Are you done?

521
02:57:43,940 --> 02:57:45,960
What should I do?

522
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:52,040
It's all right.
