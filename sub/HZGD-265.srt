1
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,240
May, what time is it now?

2
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,280
Oh, it's a little past 10 o'clock.

3
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,060
Oh, I see.

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,840
Well, I wonder if it's okay to close
my eyes a little until Kiyoshi comes.

5
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,720
I got home early this morning.

6
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,200
Yeah, it's okay.
I'll wake you up before the promised time.

7
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,801
I'll wake you up before you get married.

8
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,480
Oh, thank you.

9
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,130
I've been married to my
husband for three years.

10
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,650
Since I got married, my
life has been really peaceful.

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,770
My husband is kind and gives me everything.

12
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,410
I have no complaints.

13
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,250
Except for one thing.

14
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,530
Hey.

15
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,130
Hey.

16
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,550
Did you fall asleep? Hey, hey.

17
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,330
Hey, hey.

18
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,390


19
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,790
Hey.

20
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,510
How do you feel today?

21
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:15,910
It's been a long time.

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,470
You mean that?

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,360
It's been less than five months.

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,880
I'm very tired from work.

26
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,880
So, good night.

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Hey.

28
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,700
I tried to be brave.

29
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,960
If you don't hug me, I'll go away.

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Hey.

31
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,660
Did you sleep? I'm sorry.

32
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,700


34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,861
I've been waiting for a long time.

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,900
I don't know at all recently.

36
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:39,901
I don't know what to do.

37
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,900
I don't know what to do
when I wake up in the morning.

38
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,420
I don't know what to
do when I watch a video.

39
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,940
Of course, I don't know what
to do when I'm touched by Mei.

40
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:08,480
But I'm not surprised at all.

41
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,900
I was worried, so I went to the hospital.

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,160
Then I got ED.

43
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,580
And the cause is unknown.

44
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,860
I'm getting old, aren't I?

45
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,120
I was told that my role was dangerous.

46
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,720
So, I'm sorry for being silent.

47
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,060
You are still at that age, aren't you?

48
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
It's hard for me, too.

49
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,500
If you think so, you can break up with me.

50
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,260
I don't care if you break
up with another man.

51
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,740
I'm really sorry.

52
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,640
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,380
I can't break up with you.

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
I like you.

55
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:21,881
I can't do it.

56
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,180
No one can do it.

57
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,670
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,950
I can't break up with you.

59
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,680
You can't break up because
you can't do it, can you? I'm sorry.

60
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,680
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,510
Since that day, I haven't had
any success with my husband.

62
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,530
I'm always alone, so I don't
have a liver to betray my husband.

63
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,740
My husband suddenly woke up and said,

64
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,340
Mei, you're so erotic. Look, I'm standing.
Would you like to do it with me?

65
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,028
I think he might be
excited like that, but I've

66
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,640
been secretly next to
my husband for two years.

67
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,650
It's been a long time, brother.
It's been a long time, sister.

68
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,190
I got a souvenir because I'm lazy.

69
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,790
I don't need that.

70
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,750
Oh, that's right.

71
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,970
Anyway, let's go inside.

72
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,950
Let's drink together.

73
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,670
Hey, Mei, get ready.

74
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
Let's have a snack.

75
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,390
It must have been hard for you to move.

76
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,430
No, it wasn't.

77
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,050
Everything was furnished.

78
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,070
Furnished?

79
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,210
I didn't know there was such a thing.

80
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:33,670
I only have clothes for
short-sleeved clothes.

81
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,150
I see.

82
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,910
It's not so hard to
clean up, is it? Not at all.

83
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,210


84
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,490
Then I can drink a lot.

85
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,650
Here you are.

86
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,730
Thank you.

87
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
It's helpful.

88
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,850
By the way, is it your
first time to live alone?

89
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,410
Yes.

90
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,530
What are you going to do with the rice?

91
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,510
I'm going to eat out.

92
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,110
And I'm going to stay
over at my brother's house.

93
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,330
Hey, hey, hey.

94
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,030
You can stay over at my brother's house.

95
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,210
The handmade rice is very delicious.

96
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,210
Oh, stop it.

97
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,290
You're not even standing up.

98
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,130
Let's have a drink together.

99
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,950
Cheers!

100
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,190
Cheers!

101
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,330
I'm so happy to drink this.

102
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,870
By the way, how is your work going?

103
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,230
It's going well.

104
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,470
Really?

105
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:50,490
Are you alright? I'm fine.

106
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,970


107
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,950
It wasn't that dangerous.

108
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,110
I thought so.

109
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,530
How is your company?

110
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,670
How is your private
life? I don't know.

111
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160


112
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,650
I think you should get used to it.

113
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,610
Isn't it too soon?

114
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,570
I don't think so.

115
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,910
You've been married for a long time.

116
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,350
Yes, I have.

117
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:17,850
But you have a good family.

118
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:18,851
It's good, isn't
it? I'm jealous.

119
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,890


120
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:30,985
Here you are, Aiki.

121
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:32,990
It's hot.

122
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,690
It's heavy.

123
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,330
Are you all right?

124
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,390
I think I drank too much.

125
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,090
You drank too much.

126
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,490
I'm sorry.

127
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:49,050
It's okay.

128
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,750
Wake me up in an hour.

129
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,330
I'm sorry.

130
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,970
I'll take a break for an hour.

131
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,490
Are you going to sleep?

132
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,050
I'll take a little break.

133
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:01,770
Really?

134
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm not going to sleep.

135
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,230
I'm counting on you.

136
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,470
I understand.

137
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,010
I fell asleep.

138
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Can I still stay here? It's OK.

139
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,320
You can think this is your home.

140
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm sorry.

141
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
Weren't you worried when you came to
Tokyo all of a sudden from your hometown?

142
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,270
I was very worried.

143
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,930
But my brother and his wife
were there, so I was worried.

144
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,730
You were so eager to be spoiled.

145
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,270
I'm sorry.

146
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,890
If it bothers you, I'll
do it at a good distance.

147
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,770
No, it's okay.

148
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,850
You left a girlfriend in
your hometown, didn't you?

149
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,890
Are you okay with that?

150
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,550
What? No, I don't have a girlfriend.

151
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,870
What? Did my brother say that?

152
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,210
What? You don't have a girlfriend?

153
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,230
Kouji says he has a girlfriend.

154
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,780
Nice, nice, nice.

155
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,310
I'm sorry.

156
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,250
No, it's okay.

157
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,020
How is your life as a couple?

158
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,240
You're living far away from
your parents, aren't you? It's fun.

159
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,140


160
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,180
Koji-san is cute like a child.

161
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,440
And he is very kind. I'm spoiled.

162
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I see.

163
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,910
I'm relieved.

164
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,100
Don't you have any
children? Oh, I'm sorry.

165
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,580
Well.

166
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,340
..

167
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,920
Should I say it?

168
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,120
Kiyoshi-kun, are you
sure you won't tell anyone?

169
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Yes.

170
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,180
Kouji-san, since 2 years ago,

171
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,120
you suddenly became ED.

172
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,810
Somehow,

173
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,110
at that time, you gave
up, didn't you? I'm sorry.

174
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600


175
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,040
But why did you ask me that?

176
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,320
Well, I was wondering what it was like.

177
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,890
I didn't expect it to be like that.

178
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,200
You don't have to ask me.

179
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,900
You still want to enjoy
the night, don't you?

180
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,060
I'm still young, but it's bad to betray.

181
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm scared.

182
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,560
So I haven't done it for two years.

183
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,480
It's terrible, isn't it?

184
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,180
Kiyoshi-kun, do you do it alone?

185
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,261
Do you want to do it alone?

186
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,740
Well, I don't mind.

187
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,680
I've been doing it alone all the time.

188
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
At that time, it feels so good, doesn't it?

189
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,740
But after it's over, I'm more dizzy.

190
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,630
Can I sit next to you?

191
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,070
What?

192
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,100
You're drunk, aren't you?

193
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,250
Am I not that attractive?

194
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:17,110
I'm trying to be brave and ask you out.

195
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:33,600
I'm not sure if I can
do it with Kiyoshi-kun,

196
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:48,510
but I think Kouji-san
feels the same way.

197
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,510
I'm going to touch you.

198
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:32,030
Touch me.

199
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:33,031
Are you okay?

200
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,400
Do you feel good?

201
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,960
But... Big brother is there.

202
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Are you sure?

203
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Yes.

204
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
This is not good.

205
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
I can't get up.

206
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,560
Touch me more.

207
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:10,840
It feels good.

208
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,050
Look.

209
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:42,470
Look, Hanpe-chan.

210
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,110
It feels good.

211
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:35,450
I forgot to touch it.

212
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,990
It's okay. Touch this side, too.

213
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,340
It's not good.

214
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,870
Why? Please.

215
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,120
..

216
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,080
It's not good.

217
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,460
Please...

218
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,040
I won't get up.

219
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
I'm fine.

220
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,190
Wow, it's tight.

221
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:15,180
It feels good.

222
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,540
I want you to look at me.

223
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,640
Touch me.

224
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,260
He is sleeping.

225
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,880
It feels good.

226
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
More.

227
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
More, please.

228
00:30:39,960 --> 00:31:28,110
Let me see.

229
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:51,950
Can I lick you?

230
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,450
No.

231
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:35,180
Oh, dear.

232
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,540
Oh, my.

233
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,010
Oh, my.

234
00:32:50,260 --> 00:33:02,150
I can't believe my face
is covered with the curry.

235
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,210
Hi guys!! Uncle Sam is back

236
00:33:48,630 --> 00:34:30,870
I'm going to apply it to your face.

237
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,650
Does it feel good? It's too hot.

238
00:35:54,810 --> 00:36:16,230


239
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:46,380
I can't take it anymore.

240
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,120
Can I do it?

241
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,080
No, you have to do it.

242
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,900
No, I can't do it.

243
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,150
I haven't done it for a long time.

244
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,440
But...

245
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,360
If you want, I can do it.

246
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,821
But... Ah...

247
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,651
Ah... Ah... Ah...

248
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,550
Ah...

249
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,750
Ah...

250
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,350
Ah...

251
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,810
Ah...

252
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,430
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah...

253
00:37:39,050 --> 00:38:18,720
Ah... Ah...

254
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:36,080
I want you to kiss me from behind.

255
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,980
I'll do it.

256
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,120
Do it.

257
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:26,840
It feels so good.

258
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,710
Oh, my God!

259
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,090
Oh, my God! It's too big!

260
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:34,840
Oh, my God! It's too tight!

261
00:42:34,841 --> 00:42:35,841
It tickles!

262
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Wow!

263
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,430
It tickles!

264
00:42:43,020 --> 00:43:32,260
It tickles!

265
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Wow!

266
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Do it again! Give it to me.

267
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,190
Give it to me.

268
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,390


269
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,220
Oh, my legs are cold.

270
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:43,445
I slept a lot.

271
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:55,780
Let's do it again.

272
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,640
Let's do it again.

273
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,020
I'm sorry. I'm going home.
Thank you very much.

274
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
Hey!

275
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,590
Koji-san, are you
okay? I'm fine.

276
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,310


277
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,130
I'll bring you some water.

278
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:38,850
Thank you.

279
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,070
You drank too much.

280
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,780
Kiyoshi, you seem to have
gone home before you knew it.

281
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,611
Did you have something to do?

282
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,900
I had a job that I had to do in a hurry.

283
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:13,820
Oh, I see.

284
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:21,120
I was going to give you the movement
ticket, but I drank too much and slipped.

285
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,020
Let's go tomorrow.

286
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,580
Yeah.

287
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,460
Good night.

288
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,980
Good night.

289
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:14,710
I'm sorry.

290
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,540
Kiyoshi, this is for you.

291
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,300
Thank you.

292
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,820
It's not much, but it's for you.

293
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,220
I'm coming.

294
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,580
Hello.

295
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,620
What are you doing?

296
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,680
Haven't you eaten
yet? No, I haven't.

297
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,740
Then go ahead and eat.

298
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,920
No, I have to get up early tomorrow.

299
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,060
What are you doing? Wait.

300
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,840


301
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,560
Hey, if there's anything left,
I can take it out right away.

302
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
Eat it.

303
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,700
Hey.

304
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,820
Yes.

305
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,980
I'll get ready.

306
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Yes, please.

307
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,060
Let's have a light party.

308
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,860
It's a moving party.

309
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,000
Yes, it is.

310
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,080
It's a big day for a moving party.

311
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:48,670
It's about yesterday.

312
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,570
What?

313
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,630
Yesterday?

314
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,730
What was it?

315
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,370
You don't remember?

316
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,300
Of course I remember.

317
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,060
I look like this, and I drink a lot.

318
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,520
Please stop joking.

319
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,020
Please don't tell my brother.

320
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,310
Of course.

321
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,321
You don't have to say that.

322
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,990
I'm sorry.

323
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,070
I'm going home.

324
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,630
I'll walk you home.

325
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,510
Thank you.

326
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,350
You forgot this.

327
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,390
Here you are.

328
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,170
Thank you.

329
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:04,171
I'm sorry.

330
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,150
You're so shy.

331
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,330
People will notice you.

332
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:15,770
I'm sorry.

333
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,130
Let's be normal.

334
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,610
Okay.

335
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:25,850
You're cute.

336
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:41,360
After all, I don't want
to let you go home yet.

337
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:55,960
Let's do it for a while.

338
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:20,220
It's not good for
you, is it? No, it's not.

339
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,780


340
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,380
My hips are moving.

341
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,400
Oh, no.

342
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,110
I can't forget what happened yesterday.

343
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,190
Ah!

344
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,460
Ah!

345
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Ah!

346
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,360
Ah!

347
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,270
Ah!

348
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:04,730
Ah!

349
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,130
Ah!

350
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,820
Give me a deep breath.

351
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Ah!

352
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,420
Ah!

353
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,000
Oh!

354
01:03:36,285 --> 01:03:37,320
Ah!

355
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,540
Ah!

356
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:34,470
・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・・・

357
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,471
...

358
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,740
What happened?

359
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,280
I want to do it again.

360
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,060
What?

361
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,480
Just for 10 minutes.

362
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,160
Is it OK?

363
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,680
10 minutes? Come here.

364
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,300


365
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,800
I'm going to change my clothes.

366
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,760
No.

367
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,520
You made me feel good.

368
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,180
Make me feel good, too.

369
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,240
Really?

370
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:04,520
How are you feeling? I'm fine.

371
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,260


372
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,661
You didn't sleep,
did you? I'm fine.

373
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,860
I understand.

374
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,600


375
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,900
I won't let you go.

376
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,430
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a scene.

377
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:00,431
Don't tease me.

378
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:03,450
Let me sleep.

379
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,520
It's hot.

380
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,320
It's hot.

381
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,790
You are very wet.

382
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,130
Because it feels good.

383
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,290
Hurry up.

384
01:09:39,585 --> 01:09:52,940
This is a video I took earlier this year.

385
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,460
This is a video I took earlier this year.

386
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,620
I'm so sorry.

387
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,000
I'm so sorry.

388
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,150
I'm so sorry.

389
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:46,151
I feel so bad.

390
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
I'm so sorry.

391
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,780
I'm so sorry.

392
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:10,220
Do you want to take
a nap? Yes, I do.

393
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920


394
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,770
Yuki is the only one who
is comfortable in the room.

395
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,700
Yuki is the only one who
is comfortable in the room.

396
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,766
She is comfortable in the room
because she can move her leg.

397
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:27,200
Are you OK? It's dangerous.

398
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,580
I can't.

399
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,630


400
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,220
It looks delicious.

401
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:43,710
Give it to me.

402
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:21,920
Not here?

403
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
It's not good here.

404
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,100
I don't like it here.

405
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:26,101
I don't want to be alone.

406
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:39,260
From that day on, I stole my
husband's eyes and called Kiyoshi.

407
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,700
Really? More.

408
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:43,780
Eat it.

409
01:18:55,450 --> 01:19:01,860


410
01:19:55,815 --> 01:20:19,960
It's almost over.

411
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:52,850
※This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

412
01:24:52,851 --> 01:24:53,851
What is it?

413
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,650
I feel like we see each
other every day recently.

414
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:00,650
That's right.

415
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:05,810
Are you having fun?

416
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:11,450
Well, I'm having a lot of fun.

417
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,610
But, is it a little dangerous?

418
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:25,630
It's dangerous, isn't it?

419
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:31,210
It's dangerous, but it's not dangerous.

420
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:33,730
What do you mean?

421
01:25:58,900 --> 01:25:59,900
You know,

422
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:04,260
when we touch like
this, we feel calm.

423
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,920


424
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,680
If we keep touching for two years,

425
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:12,860
we may become like this.

426
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,300
Hey,

427
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:21,060
Kyoshi-kun,

428
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:23,480
do you want to stop this relationship?

429
01:26:23,481 --> 01:26:24,761
Do you want to break up with me?

430
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,940
To be honest, I don't
want to break up with you.

431
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:36,200
Then let's continue until we break up.

432
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:15,030
Kiyoshi hasn't contacted me at all lately.

433
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:19,910
Mei!

434
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:26,210
Kiyoshi hasn't come recently.
Have you heard anything from him?

435
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:33,350
I haven't heard anything from him.

436
01:27:52,440 --> 01:28:00,580
It's been a while. What are you doing? You
have a day off today, don't you? Oh, I see.

437
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,220


438
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,060
Do you have any plans? I see.

439
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,800


440
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,801
Then, come to my house once in a while.

441
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:15,420
Let's have a meal at my
house and have a drink again.

442
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,680
Oh,

443
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:19,980
OK.

444
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,320
I'll be waiting for you.

445
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,220
OK. See you.

446
01:28:26,825 --> 01:28:27,825
Oh, Mei.

447
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:31,460
Kiyoshi is coming to my house from now on.

448
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,720
So, I'm sorry for the
extra meal for one person.

449
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,620
I got it. It's OK.

450
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,440
Mei, why do you only have
Kiyoshi's croquette? It's OK.

451
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,360
Kiyoshi says he eats a lot.

452
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:06,260
Besides, he is young.

453
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,720
I wanted to eat it, too.

454
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,980
It's OK, isn't it?

455
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,480
Well, it can't be helped.

456
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,400
Then, let's eat.

457
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:14,920
Yes, let's eat.

458
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,180
Itadakimasu.

459
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,600
Chiyoshi, let's make a toast.

460
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:24,510
Cheers!

461
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:36,790
By the way, Chiyoshi, you haven't shown
your face recently. Are you okay? I'm fine.

462
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:38,830
I'm not a kid.

463
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:40,730


464
01:30:08,511 --> 01:30:12,050
I don't want to eat it,
so I'm going to eat it.

465
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,310
Then I'll eat it.

466
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:17,970
It's delicious.

467
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,770
Kiyoshi-kun, you're hungry, aren't you?

468
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:25,170
Yes.

469
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:28,630
Kiyoshi-kun.

470
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:32,890
You can come to eat every
day like your own house.

471
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:35,350
Yes.

472
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,530
I'm going to sleep.

473
01:31:27,531 --> 01:31:29,690
I'm going to sleep.

474
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:46,130
Aren't you sleepy? I'm sleepy.

475
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:49,470


476
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:53,250
I want to go to bed early.

477
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,890
I'm going to sleep.

478
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:14,060
I'm going to kiss you.

479
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:32,120
Are you not scared
anymore? I'm fine.

480
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,460


481
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,060
What are you going to do when you wake up?

482
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:38,260
What should I do?

483
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:40,820
Are you OK? It's not good.

484
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,740


485
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:00,970
Ah, it feels good.

486
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:09,840
Ah, I'm going to cry.

487
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,790
Ah, it feels good.

488
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,110
It's too loud.

489
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,720
It's okay.

490
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,860
Don't wake up if you drink alcohol.

491
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:15,500
I'm going to sleep.

492
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,920
He is sleeping.

493
01:34:18,921 --> 01:34:19,921
But he is not awake.

494
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,500
I feel good.

495
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,980
I'm sleepy.

496
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:09,510
It feels good, doesn't it?

497
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:41,160
Let's go to bed.

498
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:31,490
Your muscles are tight.

499
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,470
This is very good.

500
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,590
I want you to rub me more.

501
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,930
I want you to rub me more.

502
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:01,570
I'm sleepy.

503
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,730
I want you to rub me more.

504
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,980
Mom is crying because I am
not good at speaking Japanese.

505
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:42,560
I have been used to speaking
Japanese since I was a child.

506
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:46,020
I was good at speaking Japanese, but I was
not good at speaking Japanese at that time.

507
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,760
I'm sorry.

508
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:13,230
I'm sorry.

509
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:26,150
I'm sorry.

510
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:37,260
I love you.

511
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:51,420
I love you.

512
01:38:52,870 --> 01:39:06,340
I love you.

513
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,600
I'm sorry.

514
01:39:20,601 --> 01:39:21,601
Are you awake? No, I'm not.

515
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:22,980
Then, do more.

516
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,240
I'll do more.

517
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:28,700


518
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:30,960
Do you want more?

519
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:36,240
Is it wet?

520
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,660
Yes.

521
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:53,170
Ah, it feels good.

522
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,540
You slept too much.

523
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,900
I'm sorry.

524
01:40:40,915 --> 01:40:41,915
I'm sorry.

525
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:43,740
I'm sorry.

526
01:40:43,741 --> 01:40:44,741
It's okay.

527
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,760
I'm sorry.

528
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:58,460
It's so good.

529
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,600
Please eat more chestnuts.

530
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:20,140
I'm sorry.

531
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:33,700
I'm going to sleep.

532
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,380
Are you going to sleep?

533
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:36,880
I'm going to sleep.

534
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,780
I'm going to sleep.

535
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:01,380
You are a good girl.

536
01:42:08,695 --> 01:42:17,740
Give it to me.

537
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:24,300
I want it.

538
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:28,020
Don't bully me.

539
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:32,540
I'm going to play with a cat.

540
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,760
I'm going to play with a cat.

541
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:42,570
I'm going to hit a cat.

542
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,720
I'm going to hit a cat.

543
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,640
Yuki is a cat that is
very sensitive to sounds.

544
01:43:16,641 --> 01:43:17,200
The cat is very sensitive to
the sound of human voice.

545
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:20,580
I was a little scared when I
heard the sound of the cat's voice.

546
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:31,240
I was worried about the cat's
health, but the cat was doing fine.

547
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:55,200
I'm sorry for you, I'm sorry for you.

548
01:44:56,700 --> 01:46:28,370
You want to lick me, don't you?

549
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:30,950
You want to lick me, don't you?

550
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,290
I'm going to the bathroom.

551
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:00,330
The other day, I met a man who
ate a lot of chocolate and said,

552
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:02,771
I don't know what's the matter
with me, but I'm feeling good.

553
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:21,170
I don't know what's the matter
with me, but I'm feeling good.

554
01:47:26,930 --> 01:49:04,230
Please give me a kiss.

555
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:22,640
Please give me a kiss.

556
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,280
Do you want to sleep?

557
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:31,320
Is it okay to be so close?

558
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,140
It's okay, isn't
it? No? It's okay.

559
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:34,840


560
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,520


561
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,360
Do you want to sleep?

562
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,620
I want to sleep soon.

563
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:00,310
How do you feel? It feels good.

564
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:01,810


565
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:18,410
It's dangerous, it's dangerous.

566
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:23,680
Can you do it
with this? Help me.

567
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,790


568
01:50:36,255 --> 01:51:07,780
I can't get in there.

569
01:51:08,725 --> 01:51:09,840
Do you feel good?

570
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,120
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

571
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:13,650
I'm scared.

572
01:51:15,165 --> 01:51:16,260


573
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:21,380
I don't feel good.

574
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:02,210
I have no idea what
I'm saying at this point.

575
01:52:02,211 --> 01:52:20,860
I'll continue to read the comments.

576
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,401
It's like a daily routine.

577
01:52:36,785 --> 01:53:21,710
I'm not sure if I should be here or not.

578
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:23,350
I don't know if I should be here or not.

579
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:03,170
※This is not a sound effect.

580
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:09,750
※This is not a sound effect.

581
01:54:09,751 --> 01:54:13,970
I'm going to cry.

582
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:22,510
I'm going to cry.

583
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:26,130
Ouch!

584
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:28,670
Ouch! It feels good.

585
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:04,650


586
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:24,530
※This is not a sound effect.

587
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:27,210
※This is not a sound effect.

588
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:10,530
※This is not a sound effect.

589
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:23,280
I feel good.

590
01:56:23,281 --> 01:56:24,281
I'm going to sleep.

591
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,960
I feel good.

592
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:34,500
I'm hungry.

593
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:38,300
I'm hungry.

594
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:39,800
I'm hungry.

595
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:10,410
I feel the taste of holy water.

596
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,350
Is it good? Yes, it is.

597
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:16,830


598
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:44,450
Do you want more? Yes, please.

599
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:58,240


600
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:20,280
She is 5 years old.

601
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,120
She is a mom who has
been a mother for 16 years.

602
01:58:31,121 --> 01:58:31,160
She is a mom who has
been a father for 16 years.

603
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:35,600
She is a mom who has
been a father for 16 years.

604
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:33,650
Oh my god! It's dangerous.

605
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:41,550


606
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:43,460
But it feels good.

607
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,280
I'm not going to throw up.

608
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:25,720
It feels good.

609
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:48,000
This video is a derivative
work of Touhou Project.

610
02:03:48,001 --> 02:03:48,020
In the end, it's a video of a little
girl who is having a difficult time.

611
02:03:48,021 --> 02:03:50,101
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
caused by the video.

612
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:51,360
I'll do my best to make it better.

613
02:03:51,361 --> 02:03:52,441
Thank you for your viewing.

614
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:27,034
It's been a long time since
I've had a baby, but I'm

615
02:04:27,046 --> 02:04:30,620
so happy to have a baby
that I can't help but cry.

616
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:37,271
I'm so happy to have a
baby that I can't help but cry.

617
02:04:38,085 --> 02:04:46,080
I'm so happy to have a
baby that I can't help but cry.

618
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:04,840
I broke my back.

619
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,520
My nose is runny.

620
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:35,110
I have a runny nose.

621
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,830
I feel so good.

622
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:22,930
I feel so good.

623
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:25,250
I feel so good, too.

624
02:07:34,560 --> 02:08:04,420
It's all right.
