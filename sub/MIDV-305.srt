1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:59,650
Listen carefully.

2
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,160
Good morning.

3
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,510
How long are you going to sleep?

4
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,890
I told you I would wake you up.

5
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Why are you grinning?

6
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,190
Is it a dream?

7
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,810
Anyway, look at the clock.

8
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:13,620
Look at the clock.

9
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,990
It's crazy, isn't it?

10
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,960
Don't make it in time for school.

11
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,560
It's crazy, isn't it?

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,860
Do you want to give up?

13
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,460
Well, that's true.

14
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,000
Then you can sleep for another 30 minutes.

15
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm going to sleep.

16
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,960
Good night.

17
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,270
What?

18
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,210
I can't sleep.

19
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,750
What?

20
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,360
What's wrong?

21
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:49,370
Did you wake up?

22
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,371
Did you wake up?

23
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
What?

24
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:42,450
I'm sorry.

25
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,670
I'm sorry.

26
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,110
I'm sorry.

27
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,630
Because I disturbed your sleep.

28
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,990
What?

29
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,490
What do you want to do?

30
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,490
Okay.

31
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:31,770
But...

32
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,730
I'm a little embarrassed.

33
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,050
I'll start.

34
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,730
I'm not playing with you.

35
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,450
What?

36
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,230
Do you want me to lick you?

37
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,220
Well, then...

38
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,540
Do you want me to lick your face?

39
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,940
I'll do it in a funny way.

40
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,500
I'll do it in a funny way.

41
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Thank you.

42
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,960
I can't do it.

43
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm kidding.

44
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:45,090
Do you feel good?

45
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,650
I'm not laughing.

46
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:35,651
I'm not laughing.

47
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
What's wrong?

48
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,500
Do you want me to touch you?

49
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,910
Can I touch you?

50
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,370
Then I won't touch you.

51
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,010
I won't touch you at all.

52
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:29,560
What's wrong?

53
00:09:45,890 --> 00:10:18,960
What do you want me to do?

54
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,530
Do you feel good?

55
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,230
What?

56
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,930
That's not true.

57
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,330
That's not true.

58
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,940
I'm not playing with you.

59
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,460
What?

60
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,080
Okay.

61
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,910
I think you were sleeping.

62
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,190
You're cheating on me.

63
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,040
Then I'll do it next time.

64
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,570
Do you feel good?

65
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:44,090
I'm not playing with you.

66
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,510
I'm not playing with you.

67
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Let's lick each other.

68
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
What?

69
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,190
Do you want me to put it in your mouth?

70
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,190
Do you want me to put it in your mouth?

71
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:04,600
Do you want me to put it in your mouth?

72
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,810
I'll put it in your mouth.

73
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:05,760
I can't do it.

74
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:37,040
Do you feel good?

75
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,170
Do you feel good?

76
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,840
I can't do it.

77
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
I can't do it.

78
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
It's the first time to
do it in the morning.

79
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,140
It's a little embarrassing.

80
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:29,980
It feels good.

81
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:47,070
It hurts.

82
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:29,550
It hurts.

83
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,800
It feels good.

84
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,320
Can I touch you?

85
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,330
It hurts.

86
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,950
It feels good.

87
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,780
Do you feel good?

88
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,760
I'm not playing with you.

89
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I woke up.

90
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,210
What are you going to do?

91
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,030
Are you going to school?

92
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Let's get ready.

93
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,930
I'm not playing with you.

94
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,590
I'm not playing with you.

95
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,770
I'm not playing with you.

96
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:05,771
I was teasing you a lot.

97
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,070
Are you brushing your teeth properly?

98
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,590
Are you brushing your teeth properly?

99
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,310
I'll check it.

100
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Open your mouth.

101
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
It stinks.

102
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,690
I'm not playing with you.

103
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,770
Let's get ready and go to school.

104
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,130
What?

105
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,390
What are you doing?

106
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,430
I'm a little scared.

107
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,310
Don't do that.

108
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,430
It's not a bad thing.

109
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,950
I was surprised because it was sudden.

110
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
It's okay.

111
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
I was surprised.

112
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:44,770
I was surprised.

113
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,400
I was surprised.

114
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:58,401
I was surprised.

115
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,330
I was surprised.

116
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,960
How are you doing these days?

117
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,920
Do you have a part-time job?

118
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Do you have a shift?

119
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,560
Is your shift pretty hard?

120
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,780
Good job.

121
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:49,080
It's true that you've been
coming home late lately.

122
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:53,970
You look busy.

123
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,000
Me?

124
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,001
Me?

125
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm busy, too.

126
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,240
I have a lot of things to do.

127
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,401
I have a lot of things to do.

128
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,820
Like games.

129
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,510
I'm sorry.

130
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,540
But it's important.

131
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:24,580
Games are important, too.

132
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,240
Since a while ago?

133
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,480
It's been a long time.

134
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,680
Did you grow up?

135
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,260
I think I'm growing up every day.

136
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Did you grow up?

137
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,720
F cup.

138
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,620
I have a feeling for the F cup.

139
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:05,920
I have a feeling for the F cup.

140
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,701
I have a feeling for the F cup.

141
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:16,930
Why are you getting bigger?

142
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Are you getting bigger?

143
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,050
You're touching your nipples.

144
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,671
I don't think it's related.

145
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,490
It's not related.

146
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,220
You've been touching
your nipples for a long time.

147
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,800
You're very nervous.

148
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,900
Do you like your nipples that much?

149
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:30,920
You don't like it?

150
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,780
You touched my nipples a lot.

151
00:46:37,781 --> 00:46:43,330
You touched my nipples.

152
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,470
That's amazing.

153
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
That's amazing.

154
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,970
I haven't touched you that much yet.

155
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,710
I haven't touched you that much yet.

156
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,530
It's okay if you touch me.

157
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,231
I thought you'd understand.

158
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
What are you doing?

159
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
Do you want me to touch you?

160
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,300
It's okay.

161
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,020
You look tired.

162
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,130
I'll touch you.

163
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:16,131
I'll touch you.

164
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,190
Do you want me to touch your nipples?

165
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,070
It's okay.

166
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,880
How is it?

167
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:17,881
How is it?

168
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,460
You're eating a lot.

169
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,610
You look like you want me to lick you.

170
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,860
It's okay.

171
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:12,861
I'll lick your nipples.

172
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,500
Really?

173
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,451
Why are you saying such a terrible thing?

174
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,390
I'll forgive you.

175
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,060
What are you doing?

176
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:17,690
What is it?

177
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:18,691
What is it?

178
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,330
Are you licking my nipples?

179
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,730
Are you serious?

180
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:27,731
Are you serious?

181
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
That's a lie.

182
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,420
You're kidding, aren't you?

183
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,920
Are you serious?

184
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:51,780
It's okay if you're serious.

185
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,040
I've never done that.

186
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,041
I've never done that.

187
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,500
Are you sure?

188
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:09,160
Don't laugh even if you can't do it.

189
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,200
I'm serious.

190
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,880
I've never done that.

191
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,360
I love you.

192
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,440
Can you do that?

193
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,900
Are you okay?

194
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,350
Does it feel good?

195
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:58,900
I've never done that.

196
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,900
It's my first time since I was born.

197
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:11,420
I can't do that.

198
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,770
Does it feel good?

199
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,530
I feel good, too.

200
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,120
It's a strange feeling.

201
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,740
It's a strange feeling.

202
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,080
Does it feel good?

203
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:24,081
What?

204
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:39,270
I don't know if I'm doing it right.

205
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,960
Can you do that?

206
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,160
Are you serious?

207
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,060
What are you doing?

208
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:40,730
Are you serious?

209
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,770
Did you do it?

210
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,770
I'm glad to hear that.

211
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:15,010
Can you do that?

212
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,410
I'll think about it.

213
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,040
I drank a lot.

214
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,280
Don't you drink that much?

215
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,460
What?

216
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,440
I drank a lot.

217
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,760
Do you like it?

218
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:18,800
I love you.

219
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,400
I love you.

220
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:35,170
Do you like me?

221
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,180
I'm glad to hear that.

222
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,060
I drank a lot.

223
00:58:57,061 --> 00:58:58,061
I'm glad to hear that.

224
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:22,800
I love you.

225
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,630
I'm sweating.

226
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:41,910
I'm sweating, so I can't do that.

227
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,830
What?

228
00:59:46,050 --> 01:00:08,230
Does it hurt?

229
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,220
I'm sorry.

230
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,260
I'm sorry.

231
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,680
Does it tickle?

232
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,800
I think I'm ticklish.

233
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,680
I'm sorry.

234
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,260
I'm ticklish.

235
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,280
What?

236
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,340
Do you want to do that?

237
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,480
Do you want to do that?

238
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,920
Okay.

239
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,560
I want to do that.

240
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:39,800
I want to do that.

241
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,880
Do you want to do that?

242
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,980
Do you want to do that?

243
01:02:04,105 --> 01:02:05,105
Do you want to do that?

244
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,500
It's hot.

245
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,300
I'm sweating.

246
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,220
Don't do that.

247
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,440
I'll wipe my sweat with
the smell of my hands.

248
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:54,340
It's sticky, isn't it?

249
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:40,560
It's sticky, isn't it?

250
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:41,561
Hello.

251
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,300
Wow.

252
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,540
Hey.

253
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,500
Kiss me.

254
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,140
Kiss me more.

255
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,050
Wow.

256
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:18,440
Don't do that.

257
01:05:18,441 --> 01:05:23,680
What are you doing?

258
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:25,590
Don't do that.

259
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,660
That's not fair.

260
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:56,661
That's not fair.

261
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,860
Don't do that.

262
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,240
That's not fair.

263
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:05,900
I'm sorry.

264
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,740
No.

265
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,540
I'm tired.

266
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,130
Touch me more.

267
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,360
Don't open your eyes.

268
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,060
It's embarrassing.

269
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,561
Don't look at me too much.

270
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,800
Don't look at me too much.

271
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:40,170
Don't look at me too much.

272
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:41,590
Isn't it too much?

273
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,590
Do you want to look at me that much?

274
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:56,970
It's embarrassing.

275
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,330
It feels good.

276
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,550
Wow.

277
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,980
Don't do that.

278
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,560
Touch me more.

279
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,670
Don't look at me.

280
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:28,890
Don't look at me.

281
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,190
No.

282
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:34,850
No.

283
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,430
No.

284
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:39,510
Don't do that.

285
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:44,330
Don't touch my butt.

286
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:17,090
My butt.

287
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:25,700
Hey.

288
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,440
It tickles.

289
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:58,970
Why do you tickle me?

290
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:01,490
Why?

291
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,090
Kiss me.

292
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,300
Wow.

293
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,400
Hey.

294
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:32,280
I want you to kiss me.

295
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,960
Hey.

296
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:56,520
I can't push you.

297
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,440
Take off your panties.

298
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,260
I want you to take off your panties.

299
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,920
I want you to take off your panties.

300
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,160
Wow.

301
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,640
What?

302
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
I'm sorry.

303
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,260
I'll lick you.

304
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:12,820
Doesn't alcohol hurt?

305
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,020
Does it hurt?

306
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:31,680
Does it feel good?

307
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,120
That's how it is.

308
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,260
Kiss me.

309
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,900
Let's kiss.

310
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,410
Wow.

311
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,091
Put your hand in my mouth.

312
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:55,851
Put your hand in my mouth.

313
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:55,825
Wow.

314
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,100
It tickles.

315
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,470
I'll move now.

316
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,410
Wow.

317
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,550
I want to kiss you.

318
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,910
Wow.

319
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,960
It tickles.

320
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:27,790
I can't move.

321
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,890
Do it from behind.

322
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,290
Hey.

323
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,460
Don't tickle me.

324
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:51,270
Wow.

325
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:33,990
Wow.

326
01:28:38,580 --> 01:29:38,630
Let's go.

327
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:42,230
Let's go together.

328
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,560
Put your hand on my butt.

329
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,460
It's fun to drink alcohol.

330
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,801
Let's do it again next time.

331
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,680
I love you.

332
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:07,530
Kiss me.

333
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,520
What are you doing?

334
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:40,650
What are you doing?

335
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:41,110
I'm going to the bathroom.

336
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:42,550
Get out.

337
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:43,650
Get out.

338
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:45,670
Get out.

339
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,430
Get out.

340
01:31:49,431 --> 01:31:50,431
Get out.

341
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,490
I'm not waiting for you.

342
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,030
I'm going to the bathroom.

343
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,110
Wait a minute.

344
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:10,890
I can't.

345
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:12,670
I can't.

346
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:20,890
I can't.

347
01:32:20,891 --> 01:32:21,110
I can't.

348
01:32:21,111 --> 01:32:21,510
I can't.

349
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,670
I can't.

350
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:42,330
I can't.

351
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,070
Wait a minute.

352
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:45,810
I can't.

353
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:48,890
I don't want to.

354
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:54,310
I don't want to.

355
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:56,230
I don't want to.

356
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,970
I don't want to.

357
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:07,490
I can't get out.

358
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,230
I can't get out.

359
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:16,650
I can't get out.

360
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,640
I can't get out.

361
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,330
I can't get out.

362
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:26,130
Why?

363
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:34,250
Do you want to see me?

364
01:33:34,251 --> 01:33:35,251
Don't you want to see me?

365
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:37,890
I don't want to see you.

366
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,180
You're angry.

367
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:56,500
I'm going to get out.

368
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:59,020
Get out.

369
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:05,440
I'm going to get out.

370
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,900
Go away.

371
01:34:07,901 --> 01:34:09,580
I'm really going to get out.

372
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,000
Wait a minute.

373
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,960
I'm really going to get out.

374
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,280
I'm out.

375
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Wait a minute.

376
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,940
It's terrible.

377
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:58,760
I'm really going to get out.

378
01:34:58,840 --> 01:34:59,960
Don't take off your clothes.

379
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,700
Don't take off your clothes.

380
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,640
It's okay, right?

381
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,000
Why?

382
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:18,830
Why?

383
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:22,780
I'm going to bed.

384
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,080
Hey.

385
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:01,690
You don't look well.

386
01:36:01,691 --> 01:36:01,890
You don't look well.

387
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:03,710
Are you okay?

388
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,540
You don't sleep well?

389
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,320
You have to sleep well.

390
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,790
You can't go to school if you sleep.

391
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:25,910
Okay.

392
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,050
I'll make something to cheer you up.

393
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:32,491
I'll make something to cheer you up.

394
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:35,290
Leave it to me.

395
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:10,570
Have you ever done this?

396
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:24,720
It's open.

397
01:37:54,985 --> 01:37:57,070
If you do this, you'll wake up.

398
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:35,900
It smells good.

399
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:18,560
This is the most important thing today.

400
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,680
What's wrong?

401
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:47,930
One more time?

402
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,490
You said you were sleepy.

403
01:39:55,290 --> 01:40:02,890
If you don't do this, you'll wake up.

404
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:08,730
I'm sorry.

405
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:09,970
I'm sorry.

406
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:18,130
I'll treat you to a drink.

407
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:19,990
Let's go to the convenience store.

408
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:47,100
Do you only want ice cream?

409
01:40:55,565 --> 01:40:58,120
I'll have ice cream, too.

410
01:41:00,605 --> 01:41:01,605
I like ice cream.

411
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,020
I smelled it earlier.

412
01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:10,605
I want to eat ramen.

413
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:15,570
I'm hungry.

414
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,340
I'll buy a cup of ramen.

415
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:46,620
Unexpectedly?

416
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:56,520
Is it good?

417
01:41:56,521 --> 01:41:57,521
Is it good?

418
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:00,960
I want to eat it.

419
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:05,900
What are you doing?

420
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:16,280
It's delicious.

421
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:33,150
It's delicious.

422
01:42:36,705 --> 01:42:37,705
You're getting better.

423
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,410
What did you say?

424
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:54,130
It's not a sound.

425
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:08,390
I thought it would feel good.

426
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:30,750
Do you want me to do it?

427
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:43,890
I'll think about it.

428
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,860
I'm going to take a break.

429
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:01,090
Okay.

430
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:09,840
How do you want me to lick you?

431
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:17,930
Like I'm in love?

432
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:21,490
What's that?

433
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,490
I don't know what it's like.

434
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:31,570
I don't know.

435
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,210
I'll lick you in various places.

436
01:44:34,211 --> 01:44:35,211
I'm going to lick you.

437
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:42,320
First of all,

438
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,860
From the ear.

439
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:11,450
The other side.

440
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:18,841
Do you want me to be gentle?

441
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:25,160
Do you think I'm tired?

442
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:28,890
Sometimes.

443
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,530
Let's go.

444
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:58,710
Is it cute?

445
01:48:01,480 --> 01:49:12,160
What do you want me to do?

446
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:20,400
Do you want me to lick you?

447
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:26,350
All right.

448
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:54,300
My feet are moving.

449
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,920
It was cute.

450
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,820
Here we go.

451
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:43,060
Is it bad?

452
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,760
It's like I'm in love.

453
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:49,900
Did you lick me?

454
01:51:54,320 --> 01:52:29,800
Is it erotic?

455
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,041
What do you want me to do?

456
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,250
It's a little early.

457
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,660
Can you stand it?

458
01:53:10,780 --> 01:54:05,900
It's too strong.

459
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:10,580
Really?

460
01:54:10,581 --> 01:54:11,581
Really?

461
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:13,930
Is it bad?

462
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:54,620
Do you want me to get up?

463
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:39,670
I ate a lot.

464
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,640
I ate a lot.

465
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:11,000
My eyes are bad.

466
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,800
It's really bad.

467
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:20,600
I think I should sleep a little.

468
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:27,300
I'm not going to die.

469
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:30,430
Let's sleep today.

470
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:44,890
I'm going to sleep.

471
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:05,250
What?

472
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:17,010
I'm using it now.

473
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:19,050
Wait a minute.

474
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:30,180
Wait a minute.

475
01:58:30,181 --> 01:58:35,020
It takes a long time to remove makeup.

476
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:28,800
I don't want to remove my makeup.

477
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,010
I'm going to sleep.

478
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:57,230
Do you want me to get up?

479
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:18,640
Did you get it?

480
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:04,620
I'm going to sleep.

481
02:01:39,705 --> 02:01:48,700
I'm cute even if I don't have makeup on.

482
02:01:53,925 --> 02:02:09,590
I'm going to sleep.

483
02:02:33,805 --> 02:02:39,370
I'm embarrassed.

484
02:02:51,950 --> 02:03:03,740
You look at me a lot.

485
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:53,320
My mouth hurts.

486
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:03,221
You're touching me too much.

487
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,070
I'm going to sleep.

488
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:39,250
I can't.

489
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:03,540
I'm embarrassed.

490
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:16,160
I'm going to sleep.

491
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:47,520
Did you feel dizzy?

492
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51,260
You're right.

493
02:06:51,261 --> 02:06:52,261
I'm going to sleep.

494
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:02,320
You're getting closer to me.

495
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,410
Am I cute?

496
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:11,170
Really?

497
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:18,290
Am I cute?

498
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:24,760
You're lying.

499
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:28,220
Really?

500
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:32,530
I'm going to sleep.

501
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:49,490
I'm going to sleep.

502
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:51,790
All right.

503
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:55,350
What?

504
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:08,310
I'm going to sleep.

505
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,240
What?

506
02:09:55,920 --> 02:10:07,220
What are you doing?

507
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:35,910
I'm going to sleep.

508
02:10:35,911 --> 02:10:36,911
What is this?

509
02:10:38,890 --> 02:10:39,570
I'm going to sleep.

510
02:10:39,571 --> 02:10:40,571
I'm going to sleep.

511
02:11:02,735 --> 02:11:05,280
You're touching me.

512
02:11:35,760 --> 02:12:00,020
I'm going to sleep.

513
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:02,100
I'm going to sleep.

514
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,680
It feels good.

515
02:12:54,475 --> 02:13:00,930
I'm going to sleep.

516
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:28,780
You touched me again.

517
02:13:30,750 --> 02:13:31,560
Are you going to sleep?

518
02:13:31,561 --> 02:13:33,800
Are you going to sleep?

519
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:35,350
Are you going to sleep?

520
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:38,320
You're cute.

521
02:13:38,321 --> 02:13:39,321
I'm going to sleep.

522
02:13:43,900 --> 02:14:30,360
I don't want to.

523
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:39,540
I don't want to.

524
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:41,580
I don't want to.

525
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:52,410
I'm going to sleep.

526
02:14:52,411 --> 02:14:53,411
I'm going to sleep.

527
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:31,050
I'm going to sleep.

528
02:15:42,710 --> 02:15:43,710
I'm going to sleep.

529
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:15,300
I'm going to sleep.

530
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:17,500
I'm going to sleep.

531
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:26,690
Are you going to sleep?

532
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:31,970
I don't know.

533
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:52,720
I'm going to sleep.

534
02:17:01,475 --> 02:17:02,740
That's not fair.

535
02:17:19,710 --> 02:17:21,400
I'm going to sleep.

536
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:22,401
That's not fair.

537
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:29,220
I'm not good at this.

538
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:37,200
What?

539
02:18:39,170 --> 02:18:40,490
Why did you do something like me?

540
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:48,920
Are you imitating me?

541
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:55,120
I can't help it.

542
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:57,220
I was embarrassed because I was naked.

543
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,260
You took it off yourself.

544
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:56,460
No.

545
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,270
I wanted you to take it off.

546
02:21:08,310 --> 02:21:09,630
What?

547
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:13,790
Wait a minute.

548
02:21:14,570 --> 02:21:16,570
What?

549
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:31,060
What?

550
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:38,820
Did you want to do this?

551
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:38,000
I'm going to sleep.

552
02:22:38,001 --> 02:22:39,180
Are you playing with me?

553
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:42,840
Are you playing with me?

554
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:18,970
What?

555
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:35,220
Don't do that.

556
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:45,730
Do you want to play with me?

557
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:00,840
I want to play with you.

558
02:24:00,841 --> 02:24:01,841
I'm getting sleepy.

559
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:34,720
What are you doing?

560
02:25:10,190 --> 02:26:17,450
I'm going to sleep.

561
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:37,220
I'm going to sleep.

562
02:27:10,350 --> 02:27:50,060
I'm going to sleep.

563
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:13,730
I forgot.

564
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:20,830
Wait a minute.

565
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:23,120
Wait a minute.

566
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:29,550
That's terrible.

567
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:38,760
I'm going to sleep.

568
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:12,510
It feels good.

569
02:31:53,160 --> 02:32:21,600
That's terrible.

570
02:32:48,000 --> 02:33:38,900
Are you going to sleep?

571
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:44,000
That's good.

572
02:33:47,380 --> 02:33:49,400
What?

573
02:33:56,140 --> 02:33:57,320
Do you want to show your face?

574
02:33:57,321 --> 02:33:58,521
Do you want to show your face?

575
02:35:05,490 --> 02:35:10,050
He showed his face.

576
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:19,950
I feel like I've seen everything.

577
02:35:26,570 --> 02:35:27,690
But it's okay.

578
02:35:33,845 --> 02:35:35,360
I'll only say it once, so listen.
