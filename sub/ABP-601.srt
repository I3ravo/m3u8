1
0.82 --> 4.51
 Muscle pain?

2
4.51 --> 6.51
 I'll give you a hand massage

3
6.51 --> 8.51
 Massage?

4
8.51 --> 10.51
 I want to stick my tail

5
10.51 --> 12.51
 Tail?

6
12.51 --> 14.51
 I want to stick my tail

7
14.51 --> 20.00
 Is that so?

8
20.00 --> 22.00
 I can't get up in the morning because it hurts

9
22.00 --> 24.00
 Really?

10
24.00 --> 32.11
 I see

11
32.11 --> 34.11
 How is it?

12
34.11 --> 36.11
 My back and legs are fine

13
36.11 --> 38.11
 Your legs are fine?

14
38.11 --> 40.11
 Why your back?

15
40.11 --> 44.11
 I have a lot of solo shoots

16
44.11 --> 46.11
 I see

17
46.11 --> 48.11
 Is that so?

18
48.11 --> 50.11
 I think so

19
50.11 --> 52.11
 I see

20
52.11 --> 54.11
 My hand hurts because of yesterday's massage

21
54.11 --> 56.11
 I don't know why

22
56.11 --> 58.11
 It's swollen

23
58.11 --> 60.11
 Because of spanking?

24
60.11 --> 62.11
 Yes

25
62.11 --> 64.11
 It looks like a bruise

26
64.11 --> 66.11
 It's bad

27
70.11 --> 72.11
 It hurts when you get spanked

28
72.11 --> 74.11
 Yes

29
76.11 --> 81.47
 Here

30
81.47 --> 83.47
 I'm scared

31
83.47 --> 138.56
 She's sleeping again

32
138.56 --> 140.56
 She's sleeping again

33
140.56 --> 142.56
 She likes it

34
142.56 --> 171.04
 Please press the button and get back to the parking lot

35
171.04 --> 173.04
 Make sure to get back to the parking lot

36
219.41 --> 221.41
 She can't sleep

37
221.41 --> 223.41
 I don't know why

38
223.41 --> 225.41
 Is it because it's warm?

39
225.41 --> 230.13
 I think so

40
230.13 --> 234.53
 It's not good if it's warm

41
236.53 --> 241.06
 I'm going to have sex

42
241.06 --> 244.43
 My eyes

43
244.43 --> 249.47
 I dropped something

44
265.54 --> 301.74
 Let's go

45
301.74 --> 305.50
 I didn't take this

46
312.53 --> 319.62
 Shoes?

47
319.62 --> 327.73
 I didn't prepare anything

48
373.50 --> 375.50
 Can you do it?

49
383.66 --> 389.34
 It's fine

50
418.82 --> 420.82
 I can't do it

51
420.82 --> 424.83
 Let's do it

52
424.83 --> 426.83
 I can't do it

53
426.83 --> 435.39
 I can't do it

54
435.39 --> 453.46
 I can't do it

55
453.46 --> 471.74
 Let's go

56
607.82 --> 616.83
 What's wrong?

57
636.58 --> 666.70
 Are you surprised?

58
666.70 --> 668.70
 Are you surprised?

59
670.70 --> 672.70
 Let's do it

60
672.70 --> 674.70
 I can't do it

61
687.17 --> 689.17
 Are you scared?

62
689.17 --> 712.93
 I'm scared

63
737.34 --> 739.34
 How do you feel?

64
739.34 --> 742.78
 I'm fine

65
748.56 --> 753.15
 How do you feel?

66
753.15 --> 755.15
 It looks delicious

67
757.15 --> 759.15
 How do you feel?

68
767.06 --> 769.06
 I don't know

69
773.65 --> 775.65
 Do you feel good when you do this?

70
779.02 --> 781.02
 I feel good when I do this

71
781.02 --> 783.02
 I feel good when I do this

72
786.34 --> 788.34
 Do you feel good when you do this?

73
788.34 --> 794.34
 Yes

74
794.34 --> 799.50
 Do you feel good when you do this?

75
799.50 --> 801.50
 Sometimes

76
801.50 --> 803.50
 Which part?

77
805.50 --> 807.50
 Your fingers?

78
807.50 --> 816.96
 Yes

79
818.96 --> 820.96
 You're surprised again

80
820.96 --> 822.96
 You're surprised

81
822.96 --> 824.96
 You're surprised

82
830.58 --> 832.58
 It's a great memory

83
834.58 --> 836.58
 I'm scared

84
838.58 --> 840.58
 This sofa

85
840.58 --> 847.09
 Why is it shaped like this?

86
847.09 --> 849.09
 It's a little different

87
851.09 --> 853.09
 What's going on?

88
855.09 --> 861.47
 What's going on?

89
861.47 --> 864.91
 Do you know?

90
864.91 --> 866.91
 The owner of this hotel

91
873.52 --> 882.46
 What's going on?

92
883.46 --> 911.10
 What do you do?

93
911.10 --> 913.10
 Come here

94
918.10 --> 920.10
 Can you put this on?

95
920.10 --> 936.34
 No

96
990.04 --> 999.75
 It's beautiful

97
1000.75 --> 1002.75
 It's difficult.

98
1006.75 --> 1015.49
 Your nails look like chocolate.

99
1015.49 --> 1017.49
 I don't want to.

100
1017.49 --> 1033.54
 I don't want to.

101
1033.54 --> 1035.54
 It's itchy.

102
1037.54 --> 1039.54
 How does it smell?

103
1055.44 --> 1057.44
 It's itchy.

104
1057.44 --> 1059.44
 How does it smell?

105
1059.44 --> 1061.44
 I don't know.

106
1108.06 --> 1110.06
 Show me your nails.

107
1116.06 --> 1118.06
 I'll dry your nails.

108
1120.06 --> 1122.06
 I'm scared.

109
1122.06 --> 1124.06
 What's wrong?

110
1124.06 --> 1126.06
 I'm scared.

111
1126.06 --> 1128.06
 Are you scared?

112
1128.06 --> 1130.06
 I don't want to.

113
1130.06 --> 1134.27
 Me too.

114
1134.27 --> 1136.27
 I don't want to.

115
1136.27 --> 1138.27
 You have a cute knee.

116
1138.27 --> 1140.27
 I don't want to.

117
1151.57 --> 1155.20
 I don't want to.

118
1155.20 --> 1157.20
 I don't want to.

119
1157.20 --> 1159.20
 What's wrong?

120
1159.20 --> 1164.50
 I don't want to.

121
1164.50 --> 1166.50
 What's your score?

122
1172.50 --> 1174.50
 What's your score?

123
1176.50 --> 1178.50
 60.

124
1178.50 --> 1180.50
 What did you get?

125
1180.50 --> 1182.50
 40.

126
1184.50 --> 1186.50
 I got a lot.

127
1188.50 --> 1190.50
 I don't want to.

128
1192.50 --> 1194.50
 Do you have thick hair?

129
1194.50 --> 1196.50
 No.

130
1196.50 --> 1202.94
 How old are you?

131
1206.94 --> 1208.94
 I'm a junior high school student.

132
1210.94 --> 1212.94
 Maybe.

133
1214.94 --> 1216.94
 Show me your hair.

134
1216.94 --> 1218.94
 Show me your hair.

135
1218.94 --> 1220.94
 If you don't, I'll make you go out again.

136
1222.94 --> 1224.94
 Which do you want?

137
1320.75 --> 1350.59
 You have a beautiful nose.

138
1350.59 --> 1352.59
 You have a beautiful nose.

139
1356.59 --> 1358.59
 You have a beautiful nose.

140
1358.59 --> 1372.59
 You have a pretty scent.

141
1374.59 --> 1376.59
 You have a pretty scent.

142
1623.46 --> 1628.50
 It's hot.

143
1720.96 --> 1722.96
 You are a very good girl.

144
1751.10 --> 1769.42
 Let me hug you.

145
1770.42 --> 1775.42
 If you let me hug you, you will be very kind.

146
1776.42 --> 1777.42
 It's hot.

147
2056.02 --> 2058.02
 You are a very good girl.

148
2221.01 --> 2222.01
 It's hot.

149
2287.81 --> 2288.81
 It's hot.

150
2327.19 --> 2330.40
 It's hot.

151
2339.70 --> 2340.70
 It's hot.

152
2399.54 --> 2400.54
 It's hot.

153
2409.63 --> 2414.38
 It's hot.

154
2499.63 --> 2505.59
 It's hot.

155
2535.79 --> 2545.40
 It's hot.

156
2583.33 --> 2584.33
 It's hot.

157
2674.82 --> 2677.82
 I'll put my right hand on your hip.

158
2680.82 --> 2690.62
 It's hot.

159
2692.62 --> 2693.62
 Let me see.

160
2697.12 --> 2698.12
 It's hot.

161
2699.12 --> 2700.12
 Do you want me to do it?

162
2702.12 --> 2703.12
 Do you want me to do it?

163
2705.12 --> 2721.83
 Let me see.

164
2739.51 --> 2740.51
 What's wrong?

165
2741.51 --> 2743.51
 Open your mouth as wide as you can.

166
2951.97 --> 2952.97
 It's hot.

167
3145.41 --> 3146.41
 You will be found out.

168
3148.41 --> 3149.41
 Even if you wear clothes.

169
3210.55 --> 3211.55
 It's hot.

170
3213.55 --> 3215.99
 It's hot.

171
3240.39 --> 3290.38
 Do you want me to do it?

172
3294.38 --> 3300.47
 It's hot.

173
3301.47 --> 3302.47
 It's hot.

174
3389.60 --> 3390.60
 It's hot.

175
3410.83 --> 3476.82
 It's hot.

176
3495.57 --> 3570.65
 It's hot.

177
3572.65 --> 3573.65
 It's hot.

178
3579.65 --> 3580.65
 Open your eyes.

179
3581.65 --> 3592.93
 I can't open my eyes.
