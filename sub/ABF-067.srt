00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,820
Hello, I'm Shizuha Takimoto.

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,000
Today, I'm going to a meeting place.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
By the way,

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:36,360
my clothes are like this.

5
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,380


6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,440
It's quite clean and cute.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,540
It's been a long time since I
traveled, so I'm looking forward to it.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm nervous.

9
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,510
Thank you.

10
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,350
Sure.

11
00:01:36,490 --> 00:02:03,620
Let's start.

12
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes, please.

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,250
I'm nervous.

14
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,870
Yes, it's live.

15
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,690
I'm nervous, so I'll stop using honorifics.

16
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,930
Will you stop?

17
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,450
I'll talk like my friend's brother.

18
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:28,930
Please do.

19
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,630
That's nice.

20
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,850
She's my friend.

21
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,710
Do you not drive
often? No, I don't.

22
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,530
I see.

23
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:36,550


24
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,350
Just friends get along well
with each other, don't you?

25
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:42,990
How about in the past?

26
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,090
In the past, when I was a student,
I drove in the middle of the night.

27
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,630
That's nice.

28
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,250
But I didn't drive alone.

29
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,810
It was like a group of four,
going to the sea together.

30
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,910
Was there a lot of sea?

31
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,070
Basically, there was a lot of sea.

32
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,900
It's a place close to Enoshima.

33
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,470
Did you have a boyfriend at home?

34
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,250
I had a lot of houses.

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,310
I went to the city somewhere.

36
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:17,930
By train?

37
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,310
I've never gone out.

38
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,370
I've never stayed overnight.

39
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,110
Oh, that's strange.

40
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,050
I often say good-bye after half a year.

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,930
I think I can say
good-bye after half a year.

42
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,370
Do you say good-bye to yourself?

43
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,590
No, I'm often rejected.

44
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,050
What's the reason? I don't know.

45
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,090


46
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:49,943
I don't know what it was, but one of them noticed that it was not the time
to work and fall in love, and I thought it was a lie, but I thought there

47
00:03:49,955 --> 00:04:03,350
must be someone else who likes it, but it's not a good excuse for work,
and the other one is also a job, so I don't think I'll be dumped again.

48
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,310
It's not a place where you can
see the night view all of a sudden.

49
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,110
I don't think so. I feel like it
was pretty sudden every time.

50
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,170
Do you think it's such a good woman?

51
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,470
I wonder if there was something wrong.

52
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,450
So you don't know the
meaning yet? I don't know.

53
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830


54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,970
I wonder what it is.

55
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,230
So the longest so far?

56
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:36,650
It's the longest relationship
I've ever had in a year.

57
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,630
It's still a year.

58
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:38,650
It's still a year.

59
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,110
I see.

60
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,670
I don't know what to say.

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,310
It's lonely at first.

62
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:51,290
But recently, it's easier
without a boyfriend.

63
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,910
That's true.

64
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,050
I think it's better.

65
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,491
I think it's going to be a good day.

66
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,610
I think we should go to a
nice place with a nice view.

67
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,830
The hot spring is good, but...
It's a nice place with a nice view.

68
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,050
I hope it's sunny over there.

69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,330
I think it's going to
be fine if it's like this.

70
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,070
I'm pretty good at raining.

71
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,730
If I get closer, it might rain.

72
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,865
It's been raining for the
past two days, even though

73
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:37,030
it was sunny until now
when I took the first one.

74
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,790
It was miraculously sunny when I took
it outside, but it was basically raining.

75
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,410
I see.

76
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,730
It was raining when I
took a photo in Watami.

77
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,110
I thought it was not good.

78
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,650
Me?

79
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,390
I thought it was going to rain.

80
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,690
But it is said that rain
clouds are very lucid.

81
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,790
I see.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,730
It is said to be good.

83
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:22,283
There is a saying that if you like a dragon

84
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
It's pure white.

85
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,300
It's so cool.

86
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,300
I might like it.

87
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
You're so kind.

88
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you drinking? This is.

89
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,040
..

90
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,020
Ham Shallow Beer.

91
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,541
English... It's a beer.

92
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,200
I found it.

93
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,020
Let's drink.

94
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
It's good.

95
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,550
Oh, it's pretty light.

96
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,170
It's light. It's easy to drink.

97
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,290
It's not that strong.

98
00:07:51,190 --> 00:08:06,550
It's like a dango.

99
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,830
Yeah.

100
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,150
Meccha Miso.

101
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,330
Meccha Miso.

102
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,810
Thank you for the food.

103
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,490
It's been a while.

104
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,530
This is going to be a
commercial, isn't it? Meccha Miso.

105
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,670
Meccha Miso.

106
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,910


107
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,850
I didn't understand anything.

108
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,710
This is MECCHA MISO.

109
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,170
This is MECCHA MISO.

110
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:48,180
This is MECCHA MISO.

111
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
This is MECCHA MISO.

112
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,080
This is MECCHA MISO.

113
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:51,180
This is MECCHA MISO.

114
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:51,420
This is MECCHA MISO.

115
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,421
This is MECCHA MISO.

116
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,740
This is MECCHA MISO.

117
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
This is MECCHA MISO.

118
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,900
This is MECCHA MISO.

119
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
This is MECCHA MISO.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
This is MECCHA MISO.

121
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,860
I think my boyfriend is good, too.

122
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,501
First of all, you want to be a good wife.

123
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Do you have any wishes?

124
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,420
To be honest, I don't have any.

125
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,520
You don't have any?

126
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,540
No.

127
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
I want to have a baby.

128
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,740
I want to live freely.

129
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I see.

130
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,140
At my own pace.

131
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,420
I don't like being restrained.

132
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I see.

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,360
I don't like being told,
I don't like being told, I

134
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,080
don't like being told, I
can't hold it for half a year.

135
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
That's why.

136
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
It's a lot of miso.

137
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,540
I wanted to notice it earlier.

138
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
I've been following you.

139
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,220
It's a lot of miso.

140
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm glad you noticed.

141
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,580
I'm embarrassed.

142
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Just a little.

143
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,120
This is the most embarrassing
thing I've done so far.

144
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,121
I got it.

145
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
How is it?

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Great!

147
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,640
How is it? It's good.

148
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
It's spacious.

149
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,560
Can I open this? Of course.

150
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Great.

151
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
It's nice.

152
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040


153
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,240
It's hot, isn't it? Yes, it is.

154
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:55,600
Look this way.

155
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,720


156
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,950
Isn't it crispy? Yes, it is.

157
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,410


158
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:50,160
It's hot, isn't it? Yes, it is.

159
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,681
My throat is dry.

160
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
It's OK.

161
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:41,730
I'll put on my butt.

162
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,410
Is it wet? Yes, it is.

163
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780


164
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,156
I may not be able to see inside
if I don't take off my clothes.

165
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
Yes, it is.

166
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,556
Do you want to take it
off by yourself? Yes, I do.

167
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,780


168
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,690
It's already wet.

169
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,630
Touch it.

170
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,270
Is it sweat? No, it's not.

171
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,430
It's not? No, it's not.

172
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,170


173
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,810
She's looking at it.

174
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,450
It's embarrassing.

175
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,030
Maybe it's wet.

176
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,070
No, it's not.

177
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:48,830
Are you tired? Yes, I am.

178
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,110


179
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,780
Can you lie down on
the wall? Look at me.

180
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Stand up.

181
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540


182
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,390
There is no hot water.

183
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,965
Are you embarrassed? Yes, I am.

184
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,280


185
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,460
I haven't taken a bath yet.

186
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,630
How about you?

187
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,930
You don't smell, do
you? I don't know.

188
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,290
I don't.

189
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,820
You don't? I don't know.

190
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080


191
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:43,760
It's a little sour.

192
00:16:47,280 --> 00:17:07,220
It's a little sour.

193
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:26,070
It's already hard.

194
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,350
Do you like it?

195
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,590
Do you like it? Yes, I do.

196
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,290
He is sleeping.

197
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,450


198
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,430
He is standing up, but he is not moving.

199
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,430
He is sweating.

200
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,140
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:55,030
Are you okay?

202
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,460
May I take your clothes off?

203
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,360
Did you wear this?

204
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,900
Yes. It was hard for me.

205
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,260
Wow!

206
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:48,390
It looks painful.

207
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:49,300
It looks painful.

208
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:49,600
I did it.

209
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Good job.

210
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,220
Good job.

211
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,380
I finally got it.

212
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,330
One more time.

213
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,900
Let me wipe off the sweat.

214
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,790
It's hot, isn't it?

215
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,500
Let me wipe your back.

216
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,940
It's okay.

217
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,850
Let me wipe your back.

218
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,510
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby sleeping on the floor.

219
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,360
Can I sleep here?

220
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:30,360
Do you want to sleep
here? It feels good.

221
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,060


222
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm going to sleep.

223
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,370
I'm going to sleep.

224
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,330
Look at me.

225
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm going to sleep.

226
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,460
I'm going to sleep.

227
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,090
I'm so tired.

228
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:47,710
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

229
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,510


230
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,790
Are you okay?

231
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Yes.

232
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
I feel sick.

233
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,540
Are you okay? I feel sick.

234
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700


235
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,090
Oh!

236
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,510
Oh!

237
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,110
Oh! It feels good.

238
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,650


239
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,030
Oh!

240
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh! It feels good.

241
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Oh!

Oh!

243
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
Oh!

Oh!

247
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,340
I'm sweating a lot.

248
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm sweating a lot.

249
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:38,321
It feels good.

250
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,280
It feels good.

251
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,580
It feels good.

252
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,980
Lie down on my back.

253
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,360
Wow!

254
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,700
Wow! I feel good.

255
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,670
I feel good.

256
00:45:40,220 --> 00:46:08,400

00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,150
。 。 。 I'm sorry.

260
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,750
I'm sorry.

261
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,250


262
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,650


263
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,000
Let's take a break.

264
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Let's take a break.

265
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,386
This video was made in Cooperation
with the YouTube company Tokiwala.

266
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:18,150
Thank you for watching.

Today, I'm going to
show you how to make a

00:52:21,317 --> 00:52:29,360
simple and easy-to-eat
Japanese-style rice bowl.

I'm going to show you how to make a simple
and easy-to-eat Japanese-style rice bowl.

270
00:52:36,840 --> 00:53:11,440
You spilled it on purpose, didn't you?

271
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,700
You want me to lick it, don't you?

272
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,180
One, two, three, four.

273
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,420
I want you to spill more.

274
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,620
Your legs are white.

275
00:54:27,085 --> 00:54:28,100
I'm so tired.

276
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,221
This side is bleeding a lot.

277
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,180
I'm so tired.

278
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:10,700
You're wet.

289
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,740
This is your favorite one.

290
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:58,830
You got some on your arm.

291

Let's stop eating.

300
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,120
Where are you
throwing up? My neck.

301
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:08,740
It's hot.

302
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:09,741


303
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,180
Is it good? Yes, it's good.

It hurts.

306
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,250
Look at me.

307
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:41,280
Yeah.

308
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,490
Yeah.

309
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:10,010

312
01:11:34,515 --> 01:11:40,960
Let's make it like an axe at home.

313
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:43,840
Make a window.

314
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,440
Yeah.

315
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,450
Are you ready?

316
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,451
Are you okay?

317
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:18,770
Why are you sitting
down? It feels good.

318
01:12:21,775 --> 01:12:24,240


319
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:54,810
Are you okay? Yeah.

320
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:55,910


321

Let me see.

324
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:03,690
It's wet.

325
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:18,560
Can you tell me
the taste? It's sweet.

326
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,680


327
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,220
Is it sweet? Let me see.

328
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,800


329
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:32,360
Stick out your butt and lick it.

330
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:43,900
You can open your butt.

331
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:54,780
I'm back.

332
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,440
I'm going to the hospital.

333
01:16:38,370 --> 01:17:15,910
I'm going to the hospital.

334
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:20,910
Neko-Kichi, can you show me how
to spread your legs with both hands?

335
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,780
Try moving your legs.

336
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:52,590
Neko-Kichi, are you sleepy?

337
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,050
Do you want to sleep?

338
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:16,150
I'm going to sleep.

339
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:27,740
Good night.

01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:28,741
I feel good.

341

I feel good.

342
01:18:48,911 --> 01:18:49,911
I'm sorry.

343
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,300
It hurts! I feel sick.

344
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:40,780
I feel sick.

345
01:21:19,950 --> 01:22:33,690


346
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:54,360
Do you want to drink water?

347
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Yes.

348
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,650
It feels good.

349
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,560
I feel good.

350
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:52,610
I feel good.

351
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,090
I feel sick.

352
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,340
I feel sick.

353
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:04,960
I feel sick.

354
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,080
I feel sick.

355
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,840
Are you okay? I feel sick.

356
01:27:48,915 --> 01:27:50,830


357
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,530
※This is not a still screen.

358
01:28:37,531 --> 01:28:38,830
Ouch! It hurts! I'm hurt.

359
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:47,420
I'm so happy.

360
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:49,400
I love it.

361
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:18,320
I feel so good.

362
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,520
I'm sorry.

363
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,580
It's OK.

364
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:34,520
Come here.

365
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,080


366
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,700
Oh, my God!

367
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:13,220
Oh, my God!

368
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:31,540
Oh, my God!

369
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:59,920
Which side do you want? Inside.

370
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,580
Oh, it hurts.

371
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,500


372
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,120
Are you all right?

373
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:35,430
Oh!

374
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:37,530
I pulled out the tail.

375
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:40,890
Oh!

376
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,070
Oh!

377
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:46,830
Oh!

378
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:48,180
Oh!

379
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:48,990
Oh!

380
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:49,230
Oh!

381
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:49,790
Oh!

382
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:50,450
Oh!

383
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:52,370
Do you want more?

384
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:54,730
More?

385
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:58,570
Wow!

386
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:05,450
It's so good!

387
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:13,050
It's so good!

388
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:14,870
Wow!

389
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:16,630
One more time!

390
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,010
Yes, I understand.

391
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:24,830
I am sorry.

392
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:51,510
It's alright.

393
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,560
She is in a bad mood.

394
01:33:59,561 --> 01:34:00,561
Show me your mouth.

395
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,140
What?

396
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,460
Is it gone? I drank it.

397
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,800


398
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,680
Did you drink it?

399
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,460
There is a little bit left.

400
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,640
There is a little bit left.

401
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,460
Did you drink it? Thank you.

402
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:25,461


403
01:34:25,685 --> 01:34:30,280
It was unpleasant.

404
01:34:32,180 --> 01:35:09,900
I'm going to take off my makeup.

405
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:15,580
Today, after arriving at
the hotel and having a meal,

406
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,680
I'm going to do a double eyelid surgery.

407
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,040
I'm a little tired, so I'm
going to take off my makeup.

408
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:24,660
Are you ready to sleep?

409
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,840
I'm ready to sleep.

410
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,040
Can I take it off?

411
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:35,080
I don't want to, but... I'm
going to take off my bare face.

412
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,330
You look cute.

413
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:49,470
Look at me.

414
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:53,650
Come closer.

415
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:59,210
I don't want to because
you have a big face.

416
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,850
I don't think your bare
face will change much.

417
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,550
I think it will change a lot.

418
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:07,010
Your skin is very beautiful.

419
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:08,890
Very beautiful.

420
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,550
I don't know what will happen if I drop it.

421
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,270
You may say, nice to meet you.

422
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:14,910
I may say, nice to meet you.

423
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:15,470
I may say, who
is it? You may not.

424
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:16,970


425
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:18,730
I don't want to.

426
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:20,150
You can shake it like a cosplay.

427
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,830
What should I do?

428
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:54,730
You look so different.

429
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:05,860
Look over here.

430
01:39:05,861 --> 01:39:07,000
Look at this.

431
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,280
It's moving.

432
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:23,430
It's completely different from before.

433
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:32,720
Can I sit down?

434
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:51,220
You don't like it? No, I don't.

435
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,240


436
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,620
Do you massage
your face? I try not to.

437
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,100


438
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,000
I've heard that it causes wrinkles.

439
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,120
So I don't do it.

440
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,760
I go to bed early and get up early.

441
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,800
No, I go to bed late.

442
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,880
I go to bed early and get up late.

443
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:19,700
I sleep about 9 hours a day.

444
01:40:19,701 --> 01:40:21,940
I have a lot of hair on my head.

445
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,380
You don't have a lot of eyebrows.

446
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,250
I have a lot of hair on my stomach.

447
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:48,600
You have a beautiful face.

448
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:13,330
I'm sweating a lot.

449
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:45,430
I'm sorry.

450
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:49,030
Can I hold you? I'm sorry.

451
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:06,830


452
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,740
Let me hold you.

453
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,560
Put your tongue out and come closer.

454
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,080
Do you like it?

455
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:56,780
Look at the camera.

456
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:23,300
It's getting warm.

457
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:09,920
oh

458
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:15,960
oh

459
01:45:17,985 --> 01:45:19,420
What's wrong?

460
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:21,590
I feel sick oh

461
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:54,540
You can sit here

462
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:58,000
You can sit on your back

463
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:35,130
Open your mouth and raise your legs.

464
01:47:52,300 --> 01:48:05,540
Show me your open mouth.

465
01:48:06,065 --> 01:48:07,540
I'm going to take a bath.

466
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,620
Do you want to take a bath?

467
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:43,450
I'm getting wet.

468
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:47,190
Do you know you're wet?

469
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:48,650
Yes.

470
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:57,370
I feel sick. I can't go back.

471
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:57,880
I'll put you on the floor.

472
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,460
This way.

473
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,540
Do you want to lie down?

474
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,220
Yes.

475
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,260
From the bottom.

476
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:35,160
I'm scared.

477
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,440
Look at Mamenyan.

478
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,320
He is licking his face.

479
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,380
He is licking his face.

480
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,400
He is licking his face.

481
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:33,930
※This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

482
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,580
It's hard to hold it in.

483
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,320
I feel so good.

484
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:42,220
I can do it.

485
02:01:55,050 --> 02:02:15,390
It's hot.

486
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:44,030
It feels good.

487
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,640
It's so hot.

488
02:05:38,040 --> 02:06:05,800
I have a runny nose.

489
02:06:05,801 --> 02:06:06,801
You have a leg cramp.

490
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:45,910
It was great.

491
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:48,910
I could go to many places.

492
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:54,210
It was a great and fun trip.

493
02:06:57,845 --> 02:06:59,830
It was fun.

494
02:07:00,770 --> 02:07:08,380
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.

495
02:07:08,985 --> 02:07:09,985


496
02:07:56,120 --> 02:08:06,270
It's been a long time since I've
had a cat, so I'm a little embarrassed.

497
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:09,330
I'm a little embarrassed.

498
02:08:10,010 --> 02:08:11,550
I'm a little embarrassed.

499
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:14,690
I'm a little embarrassed.

500
02:08:14,691 --> 02:08:16,910
I'm a little embarrassed.

501
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:02,080
It's close.

502
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:04,120
It's a camera.

503
02:10:23,990 --> 02:10:24,990
I'm going to eat it.

504
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:34,550
I'll do it.

505
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:58,770
I'm done.

506
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:03,470
You're done.

507
02:11:03,471 --> 02:11:04,471
I'm embarrassed.

508
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:23,430
You're going to eat
it, right? Come here.

509
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:25,130


510
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:28,450
Can I sit here?

511
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:12,830
Hi guys, welcome back to my channel.

512

Today, I'm going to show
you guys how to make

513
02:12:26,411 --> 02:12:28,110
the most delicious
ice cream in the world.

514
