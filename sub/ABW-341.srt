1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,780
In both cases, a

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,780
1

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,780
2

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,780
3

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,780
4

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,780
5

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,780
6

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,780
7

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,780
8

10
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,780
9

11
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,780
10

12
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,780
11

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,780
12

14
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,780
13

15
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,780
12

16
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,780
12

17
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,780
14

18
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,780
15

19
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,780
16

20
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,780
16

21
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
17

22
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,780
18

23
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,780
19

24
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,780
Hey, who are you?

25
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,780
You, who always appears in my dreams.

26
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,780
Hey, who are you?

27
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,780
You, who always appears in my dreams.

28
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,780
But in the end, you always go to the place where your hands can't reach.

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,780
But in the end, I always go to a place where my hands can't reach.

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,780
I want to know you.

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Where are you now?

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
I'm going home.

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
I'm going home.

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
I'm going home.

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,780
It's been a while since I came back to my hometown.

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,780
It's been a while since I moved to Tokyo a few years ago.

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,780
But there was a reason why I didn't want to come back to my hometown.

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,780
It's because of my childhood.

39
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,780
It's because Yuu Rukawa, a childhood friend of mine, is here.

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,780
I'm so lonely.

41
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
It's my parents' fault.

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I don't want to get married.

44
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I see.

45
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
I don't want to do it.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
I don't know.

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Hey, write a letter.

48
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
What? A letter?

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
Yeah.

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Not on my phone?

51
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
No.

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,780
I want a letter with my heart.

53
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Oh.

54
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Let's do something on August 25th, the anniversary.

55
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
I promise.

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
You promise?

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
Yeah.

58
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Are you done?

59
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Yeah.

60
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,780
Takuya, please take care of Yu.

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
You're the only one I can count on.

62
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
Okay.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,780
You're my best friend.

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Leave this to me.

65
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,780
Mom, there's a customer.

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Mom?

67
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Mom?

68
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
Mom?

69
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Mom?

70
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Mom?

71
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Mom?

72
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Mom?

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,780
Mom?

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Mom?

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Mom?

76
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,780
Mom?

77
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
I'm so lazy.

78
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,780
Yes, yes.

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Thank you for your time.

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
Here.

81
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
This is the billboard.

82
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Wait.

83
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Could it be that you're Ikue's son?

84
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
Yuru.

85
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,780
Yuu?

86
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
You're Yuu, aren't you?

87
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Yes, I am.

88
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Nice to meet you.

89
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,780
Don't talk to me like that.

90
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Hey, get up.

91
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
Oh, yes.

92
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Here you go.

93
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Thank you.

94
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Hey, Yu.

95
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Yes?

96
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,780
How long are you going to keep joking?

97
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,780
No, I'm not joking.

98
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,780
It's just that I lost some of my memories.

99
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
What?

100
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,780
The doctor said that stress comes from the heart.

101
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
I don't understand.

102
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,780
I will protect Kimura.

104
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:18,780
I've been with you since I was a kid, and we've been together since we were little.

105
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,780
Besides, we've been dating.

106
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,780
What? Wait a minute.

107
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,780
It's okay. Listen to me.

108
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,780
I transferred and we broke up.

109
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:51,780
I've been sending letters to you, but since then, I haven't been able to get a reply from you.

110
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,780
I thought I had found another boyfriend for you.

111
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,780
I thought it would be nice if you were happy.

112
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,780
So I told myself.

113
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,780
I'm Mamoru.

114
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Do you know the name Mamoru?

115
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Huh?

116
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,780
There was a letter from you at home.

117
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
And...

118
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,780
On the diary you wrote when you were a student.

119
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
It said you'd protect it.

120
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,780
Hey, do you have any other photos?

121
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,780
I don't think I have any photos of you.

122
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Can I see your room?

123
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Huh? Why?

124
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,780
What are you looking at?

125
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,780
I might be able to remember something.

126
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I see.

127
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I understand.

128
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
Come with me.

129
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
Yes.

130
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
This way.

131
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,620
This is me.

132
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
That's right.

133
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,800
It's us from when we were students.

134
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
How do you like it?

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Do you remember anything?

136
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I don't know.

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
But I feel nostalgic.

138
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I see.

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I see.

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I always have the same dream.

141
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,000
Someone always hugs me gently,

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then he gently kisses me.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But at the end, he disappears somewhere.

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Um...

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Can you hold me?

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, no.

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait, that's...

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I know you're being selfish, but I'm begging you.

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's been a long time since I've had a meal like this, but it's so delicious that I want to eat it again.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm going to eat it again.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to eat it again.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to eat it again.

153
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's so delicious.

154
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Are you feeling good?

155
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Are you feeling good?

156
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you feeling good?

157
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Ah...

158
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Does it feel good?

159
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It feels good.

160
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Please take this off.

161
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Mmm, yum.

162
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah.

163
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Ah!

164
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

165
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Ah!

166
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Mmm.

167
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm so tired.

168
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm so tired.

169
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It feels so good.

170
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,100
I got so tired.

171
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,340
I feel so, I don't know what to do.

172
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,180
Something's up but I can't seem to make a sound either.

173
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,600
Stacy left and got a little loud for me.

174
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,900
Lucky me.

175
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Why does it feel so good?

176
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
I feel like I'm going to die.

177
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
It feels so good.

178
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
I'm getting a lot of pressure.

179
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,900
I feel like I'm dying.

180
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

181
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

182
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,200
Wow, it's so warm in here.

I feel so good.

187
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,200
No, no, no, no.

I feel so good.

197
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,200
It hurts!

198
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
It hurts!

199
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
It hurts!

200
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm so tired.

Hey!

208
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,720
I can't.

209
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,580
Why...

210
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,740
Why do you keep getting

211
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,960
this and that and this?!

212
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
It's warm.

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
It's warm.

214
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Where am I?

215
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
It feels so good.

216
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
No, no.

No, I feel sick.

220
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
No, I'm going to die.

221
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960

Please, go to sleep soon.

228
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
It feels so good.

229
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
It's gone.

230
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Feels good?

231
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
It's so hard.

232
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
It feels so good.

233
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
It feels so good.

I'll go again.

241
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,680
What? What? What?

242
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
What? What?

243
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,680
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

My legs are in the clouds.

It feels good.

248
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
No!

I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

338
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,360
Oh, no!

It feels so good.

346
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,540
Why are you doing this to me?

347
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,000
You're annoying.

348
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,480
You're annoying.

349
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,780
You' whoa!

He's got it!

353
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,080
You're annoying me back there!

354
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,960
I'm so tired right now.

355
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,640
You're annoying!

356
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,060
Why are you doing this to me?

357
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,500
Damn it!

358
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,320
I'm sleepy.

359
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Oh, it hurts.

360
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
It feels good.

361
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
Oh, no.

362
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
E-chan...

363
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
Go, go, go!

364
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:42,220
Yes, it feels good.

365
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,800
Un crystals

366
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,440
Alright.

367
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,860
Come on.

368
00:57:31,860 --> 00:58:00,860
Hey, did you remember something?

369
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:10,860
My heart is still fluttering.

370
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,860
I see.

371
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,860
But I feel shy.

372
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,860
By the way, don't you want to quit keigo?

373
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,860
What?

374
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,860
Mamoru-san is also...

375
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,860
That might be true.

376
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,860
Then, Mamoru.

377
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,860
Don't be shy.

378
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,860
Um...

379
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,860
Can you meet me tomorrow?

380
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,860
If I'm with Mamoru...

381
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,860
It might be a chance for me to get my memory back.

382
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,860
Okay, I got it.

383
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,860
See you tomorrow.

384
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,860
I can't breathe.

385
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,860
I'm sorry.

386
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Itadakimasu.

387
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,860
It's good.

388
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:24,860
I'm going to eat it with a glass of soju.

389
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,860
By the way, this is a diary.

390
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:50,860
When I read this diary, I always thought it was kind to protect.

391
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,860
Don't be shy.

392
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,860
But there's one thing I'm curious about.

393
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,860
This diary page here is also distorted for some reason.

394
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,860
What are you doing?

395
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,860
I wonder what it is.

396
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:43,860
Thank you for washing the dishes.

397
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,860
Give it to me.

398
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:46,580
Yeah?

399
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,820
You're not getting anyuc付了

400
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,380
Huh?

401
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,500
It's delicious.

402
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,000
You got me down, huh?

403
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
This is the end of the video.

404
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Thank you for watching until the end.

405
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Please subscribe to the channel if you like.

406
01:08:44,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Thank you for washing the dishes and giving me this carrot.

407
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I'll give you a present.

408
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
What? No, it's okay. I just gave it to you.

409
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
What? It's fine.

410
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
No, it's not.

411
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
It's fine, it's fine.

412
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Really?

413
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's a thank you gift.

414
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It's cute, isn't it?

415
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Ah, it's hot.

416
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,880
Does it feel good?

417
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,880
I'm sorry.

418
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
Hey, it's hard to do. Can you sleep for a while?

419
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Yeah.

420
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,880
Let's touch Chikkun.

421
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:04,160
I'm going to drink yaen-chang tea.

422
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:12,820
What's this sound?

423
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:21,940
I'm close friends with him.

424
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:40,820
Half of the

425
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,820
It was so delicious.

426
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,820
It's the best!

427
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,820
Is it good?

428
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,820
It's good.

429
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,820
You want to go?

430
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,820
It's good.

431
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,820
It's good.

432
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,820
No.

433
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,820
No.

434
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,820
No.

435
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,820
You can't go yet.

436
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,820
No?

437
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,820
You'll feel better if you wait.

438
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:08,840
I'm not drunk yet

439
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,020
Are you drunk?

440
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,920
Hurry up, hurry up

441
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,580
I'm not drunk yet

442
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,900
Don't drink too much

443
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,700
I'm not drunk yet

444
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,060
I'm not alone

445
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,920
Don't drink so much

446
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,820
I just barely drank

447
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,060
That's how you organization affect its quality

448
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,820
I can only drink three of a kind

449
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,820
I know this is too bittersweet.

450
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,820
But your blood is the reason why I believe we must be careful.

451
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:46,820
You need to spend more effort to find love, less of a stomach ache...

452
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,820
That alone is what makes me, much moreים.

453
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,820
Alright sometime later my baby will finally recognize you.

454
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,820
Take good care of yourself along with buttons on the wall.

455
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,820
What?

456
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,820
I think I can do it

457
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,820
You think you can do it?

458
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,820
You can't go yet.

459
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,820
What?

460
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,820
I can't go?

461
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,820
You can't.

462
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,820
It's too early to go.

463
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,820
Please be patient.

464
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:49,820
It was more delicious than Amore's chin-chin.

465
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:22,820
By the way, the anniversary of our date is tomorrow, August 25th.

466
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:26,820
You always wanted me to do that and that.

467
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,820
It was hard.

468
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,820
Oh, really?

469
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,820
It's nostalgic.

470
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,820
I want to remember you as soon as possible.

471
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,820
Hey, it's been a while.

472
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,820
Did you meet Yu?

473
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:19,820
Yeah, but I forgot about me.

474
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,820
I see.

475
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,820
What are you doing? Tell me.

476
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,820
I'll give this to you.

477
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:33,820
Aha.

478
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:35,820
What's going on?

479
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:37,820
See you later.

480
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:38,820
Huh?

481
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:40,820
Hey!

482
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:46,820
The letter I received from Takuya had something shocking written on it.

483
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:50,820
That was what happened when I wasn't there.

484
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:54,820
August 25th, the anniversary of our first date.

485
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:55,820
Suddenly, memories began to flow like a soma-tou.

486
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:01,820
There were so many memories in my head that I couldn't get rid of them.

487
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:25,820
On August 25th, my part-time job was off and I was hanging around at home.

488
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:36,180
This year was also the beginning, but the cooler of the house was broken, and the fan was the last hope.

489
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:42,780
At that time, I got a message from Kenny, who I used to play with a lot when I was little.

490
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:49,660
Kenny graduated from the medical school and is a super elite who works at a university hospital.

491
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:55,660
It's been a long time since we've met at Ken's house because he's coming back here.

492
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,660
All right, let's open it.

493
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,660
Thank you, Ken.

494
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,660
I'm going to drink it now.

495
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,660
Really?

496
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,660
Yeah.

497
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,660
That's weird.

498
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,660
Oh, it's good.

499
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,660
Yeah.

500
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,660
It's good.

501
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:27,660
It's good.

502
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:28,660
I did it.

503
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,660
Cheers.

504
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,660
Cheers.

505
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,660
It's good.

506
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,660
It's good.

507
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,660
It's good.

508
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:40,660
It's good.

509
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,660
It's good.

510
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,660
It's good.

511
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,660
Cheers.

512
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,660
Yes, it's delicious.

513
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,660
It's delicious.

514
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:50,660
You've grown up a lot.

515
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,660
Really?

516
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,660
You've grown up a lot.

517
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,660
Shut up.

518
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:57,660
You've grown up a lot.

519
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,660
Do you have a boyfriend?

520
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
Boyfriend?

521
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,660
Suddenly?

522
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:15,660
There are, but it's far away, so it doesn't go well.

523
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,660
Aren't you lonely?

524
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:23,660
Well, to be honest, I'm lonely.

525
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,660
Do you have any relatives?

526
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,660
No, I don't.

527
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,660
Because I'm not popular.

528
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,660
What? That's not true.

529
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,660
Because I'm the most popular person in the neighborhood.

530
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:09,660
I don't want to leave you alone.

531
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,660
Wait a minute.

532
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,660
Are you okay?

533
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:21,660
Kenny.

534
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,660
Kenny.

535
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,660
Wait a minute.

536
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,660
Ah...

537
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,660
Ah...

538
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,660
No...

539
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,660
Please stop...

540
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,660
Ah...

541
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,660
Ah...

542
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,660
Ah...

543
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,660
Ah...

544
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,660
Ah...

545
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,660
Ah...

546
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:51,660
Ah...

547
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,660
Are you angry?

548
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,660
No, I'm not.

549
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,660
Then, let's meet tomorrow.

550
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:01,660
But, after all...

551
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,660
What's wrong with you?

552
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,660
It's okay.

553
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,660
I see.

554
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,660
I see.

555
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,660
I see.

556
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,660
I see.

557
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,660
I see.

558
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,660
I see.

559
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,660
It's been a while since I've been to your house.

560
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,660
You haven't changed a bit.

561
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:56,660
Really?

562
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,660
I brought this for you.

563
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,660
What's that?

564
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:11,660
I'll use this for you.

565
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,660
No, I don't need that.

566
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,660
It's okay, isn't it?

567
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,660
I don't want to.

568
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,660
It's okay, isn't it?

569
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,660
It's okay, isn't it?

570
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,660
I don't want to.

571
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,660
It's okay, isn't it?

572
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,660
Come to me.

573
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,660
I don't want to.

574
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,660
I don't want to.

575
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,660
Okay, okay, okay.

576
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:40,660
I, who was weak in my heart,

577
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,660
I couldn't do it.

578
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:11,660
I'm sorry.

579
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:15,660
Don't be mad.

580
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,660
You're the best.

581
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:37,660
I wanted to do the same with you.

582
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,660
Really?

583
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,660
What were you doing last night?

584
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,660
Didn't you notice?

585
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,660
I can't see anything.

586
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,660
Look at my mouth.

587
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,660
Cute, isn't it?

588
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,660
Put your tongue out.

589
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,660
Look at my tongue.

590
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,660
Oh, it feels good.

591
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,660
It feels good.

592
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:57,660
How do you feel?

593
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,660
I feel good

594
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:37,660
Oh, do you like it?

595
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:43,660
Oh, do you like it?

596
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:51,660
Oh, do you like it?

597
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,660
What's wrong?

598
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,660
You're the best.

599
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,660
Are you feeling good?

600
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,660
Yeah.

601
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,660
Huh?

602
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:09,660
Yeah, I'm feeling good.

603
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,660
You're feeling good?

604
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:13,660
You're feeling good?

605
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:15,660
Yeah.

606
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:17,660
You're feeling good?

607
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:19,660
Yeah.

608
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,660
Oh, no.

609
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,660
Oh, no.

610
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,660
Oh, no.

611
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,660
Oh, no.

612
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,660
Oh, no.

613
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,660
Oh, it's cold.

614
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,660
Oh, this is good.

615
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,660
It feels good.

616
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,660
Is it good?

617
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,660
Oh, it's cold.

618
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,660
Oh, it's cold.

619
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,660
Oh, it's cute.

620
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,660
What's going on?

621
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,660
It hurts!

622
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,660
It hurts!

623
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,660
Let's go, let's go.

624
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,660
It's okay, it's okay.

625
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,660
It's okay.

626
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,660
It's okay.

627
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,660
Oh, that's amazing.

628
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,660
He's looking at you like that.

629
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,660
He's looking at you.

630
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,660
He's looking at you like that.

631
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,660
Are you okay?

632
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,660
I'm sorry.

633
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,660
I was crying.

634
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:16,660
I'm sorry.

635
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,660
Show me your cute eyes.

636
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,660
I feel good.

637
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:45,660
Do you feel good?

638
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:47,660
I'm so tired.

639
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,660
I'm so tired.

640
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,660
I'm so tired.

641
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,700
Mmm...

642
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,900
Mmm?

643
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:14,140
Everyone's in trouble.

644
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,080
Ah...

645
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,200
Ah...

646
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,100
Ah...

647
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:34,720
Oh, no, no...

648
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,720
Yama, come here.

649
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:41,720
I'm coming.

650
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,720
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

651
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,720
No.

652
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:45,720
No.

653
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,720
I'm okay.

654
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,720
No, no, no.

655
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,720
I'm so tired.

656
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,720
I'm so tired.

657
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,720
I'm so tired.

658
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,720
Stop it.

659
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,720
It feels so good.

660
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:55,720
Min-chan, Min-chan.

661
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,720
No, no.

662
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,720
No, no.

663
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,720
No, no, no.

664
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,720
No, no, no.

665
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,720
Go, go.

666
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:39,720
Oh, my God.

667
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,720
Calm down.

668
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,720
It's okay.

669
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,720
Ouch!

670
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,720
It's the best.

671
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,720
Do you feel good?

672
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,720
It's ok.

673
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,720
It hurts.

674
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,720
I can't do it.

675
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,720
I'm going to fall.

676
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,720
I'm sorry.

677
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,720
I'm sorry

678
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:28,720
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

679
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
What are you talking about?

680
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,720
Come on, come on.

681
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:09,720
I'm coming, I'm coming.

682
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,720
I feel like I have to go to the hospital.

683
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,720
I feel like I have to go to the hospital.

684
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,720
I feel like I have to go to the hospital.

685
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,720
Oh, my God.

686
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,720
You are not feeling well, are you?

687
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,720
I am.

688
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,720
Huh?

689
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,720
I am.

690
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,720
Are you okay?

691
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,720
I am.

692
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,720
You are not feeling well, are you?

693
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,720
I am.

694
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,720
I am.

695
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,720
I am.

696
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,720
I am.

697
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,720
I am.

698
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,720
I am.

699
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,720
I am.

700
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,720
No, no, no.

701
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,720
I'm going to be fine.

702
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,720
No, no, no, no.

703
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,720
I'm going.

704
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,720
Ouch, ouch, ouch

705
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,300
So funny

706
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:36,520
It's really difficult and tiring, but I'm happy because of the

707
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
Oh, my God.

708
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
What is this?

709
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,520
Oh, my God.

710
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,520
Oh, my God.

711
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,520
Oh, my God.

712
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,520
It feels good.

713
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
It feels good.

714
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,520
No, no, no.

715
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,520
It's too cold.

716
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,520
It's too cold.

717
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,520
Ikku! Ikku!

718
01:52:53,520 --> 01:53:09,480
No, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no.

719
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:19,380
So talking too much!

720
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:23,060
What the hell is that?

721
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:25,060
I can't do it anymore.

722
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:33,060
I can't do it anymore.

723
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,060
Let's go.

724
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:51,060
No, no, no.

725
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:53,060
That feels good.

726
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:57,060
I'm coming, I'm coming!

727
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:15,060
Kimchi.

728
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:17,060
Kimchi...

729
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:16,060
Are you okay?

730
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,060
I'm going.

731
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:22,060
No, I'm going.

732
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:54,060
Are you okay?

733
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:13,060
Are you okay?

734
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,060
Open your mouth.

735
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,060
Open your mouth.

736
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:22,060
I can't take it anymore.

737
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:26,060
What's wrong?

738
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:28,060
I can't take it anymore.

739
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:30,060
I can't take it anymore.

740
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:38,060
On August 27th, I wanted to talk to Kenri.

741
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:46,060
I couldn't get in touch with Kenri anymore.

742
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:51,060
I couldn't get in touch with Kenri.

743
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:57,060
I couldn't get in touch with Kenri.

744
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:59,060
I can't reach him.

745
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:14,060
Oh, Keiko.

746
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:16,060
What are you doing?

747
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,060
Oh, how's Shoichi?

748
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:22,060
Oh, he's fine.

749
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:24,060
Oh, I see.

750
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:26,060
I'm going home tomorrow morning at Shinkansen.

751
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:28,060
Hmm.

752
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,060
What is it?

753
02:03:58,060 --> 02:03:59,060
I'm sorry.

754
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:18,060
Mamoru?

755
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,060
Are you there?

756
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:41,060
I remembered everything.

757
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:46,060
Why didn't you remember me?

758
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:48,060
Really?

759
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:51,060
You remembered me?

760
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:54,060
Kimura Mamoru.

761
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:00,060
He was my childhood friend.

762
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:04,060
And the person I loved the most in the world.

763
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:06,060
The person I love the most.

764
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:09,060
Yuu.

765
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:16,060
I know everything about you.

766
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:23,060
I see. I'm sorry for everything.

767
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,060
Yeah.

768
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,060
I'm so glad.

769
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:29,060
I'm so glad.

770
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:31,060
I'm so glad.

771
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:41,060
Yu.

772
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:45,060
I...

773
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:48,060
I like you.

774
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:50,060
I love you.

775
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:51,060
I love you.

776
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:57,060
I love you too, Mamoru.

777
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,060
Will you marry me?

778
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,060
Of course.

779
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,060
Um...

780
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:34,300
Um...

781
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:37,500
Um...

782
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:39,020
Um...

783
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:40,100
Ah...

784
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:41,620
Ah...

785
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:43,380
Um...

786
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:44,820
Um...

787
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:59,060
Ah...

788
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:01,060
Um...

789
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:33,060
It feels so good.

790
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,060
It feels so good.

791
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:48,060
No, no.

792
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:52,060
It feels so good.

793
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:59,060
No, no.

794
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:01,060
No, no, no!

795
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:03,060
I'm going!

796
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:05,060
No, no, no!

797
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:06,060
Eek!

798
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:07,160
Eek!

799
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:31,560
It's gross.

800
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:33,560
Ah!

801
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:37,560
Ah, it feels good!

802
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:39,560
Ah, no!

02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:41,560
Ah, no!

02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:43,560
Ah, it feels good!

805
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:45,560
Ah!

806
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:47,560
Ah, it feels good!

807
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:49,560
Ah, no!

808
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,560
Ah, no!

809
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,560
I'm going!

810
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,560
Ah!

811
02:13:57,560 --> 02:13:59,560
I'm going!

812
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,560
Ah...

813
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:15,560
Ah, it's so painful!

814
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:19,560
No, no, no, no!

815
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:26,560
No, no, no, no!

816
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,560
Ouch!

817
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:30,560
It hurts!

818
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,560
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

819
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:01,560
Oh!

820
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:03,560
Oh!

821
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:05,560
Oh...

822
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:07,560
Oh...

823
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,560
Oh...

824
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:11,560
It feels good.

825
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,560
It feels good.

826
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:21,560
It feels good.

827
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:23,560
No, no, no.

828
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:25,560
No!

829
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:28,560
It feels good.

830
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,560
I'm going to the mountains!

831
02:15:58,560 --> 02:15:59,700
Hmm...

832
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:09,020
I feel good!

833
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:12,820
Ahh nooo

834
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:14,340
Nooooo

835
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,860
I can't

836
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,820
Ahhh no

837
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:24,500
Ahhh

838
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:26,020
Hmm...

839
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:27,280
Ahh

840
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,140
Ahh

841
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:29,400
Ouch!

842
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:31,860
I can't...

843
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:02,400
Ah, it feels so good.

844
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,400
No, no, no, no.

845
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:17,400
It feels so good.

846
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,400
No, no, no.

847
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:25,400
It feels so good.

848
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:28,540
No, no.

849
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:36,840
Stop, No, no.

850
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:41,040
I can't stand it.

851
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,040
I'm going, I'm going.

852
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:12,580
What is that?

853
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:16,540
Oh, thank you.

854
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,600
No!?

855
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:26,960
What was that?

856
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:30,720
Hi.

857
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:33,980
Hi.

858
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:37,740
Oh, hi again.

859
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:38,740
Ah...

860
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:40,740
No...

861
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:45,740
No, no...

862
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:47,740
Oh no, no, no...

863
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:49,740
Oh, no...

864
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:51,740
No, no, no...

865
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:52,740
Ah!

866
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:58,740
Mmm.

867
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:04,740
Oh!

868
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:06,740
Mmm.

869
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:13,740
Mmm.

870
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:14,740
Mmm.

871
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,740
Mmm.

872
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:16,740
Mmm.

873
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:18,740
It's a little hot.

874
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,740
You can't get cold.

875
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:22,740
I'm so hot.

876

It's so hot.

877
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:29,740
Are you feeling good?

Be careful.

887
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:20,740
Be careful.

888
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:32,740
I want to go inside the house.

889
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:34,740
I want to go inside the house.

890
02:21:34,740 --> 02:21:36,580
So much power.

891
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:56,540
Turn it around.

892
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:58,540
Oh, it feels so good.

893
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:02,540
Oh, it feels so good.

It's too much!

899
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:39,540
It's too much!

900
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:43,540
No!

901
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:46,540
It hurts!

Hmm...

906
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:20,540
Ouch! Ouch!

02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:23,540
Ouch!

908
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:25,540
Ouch

909
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:58,540
I feel like I'm going to die.

910
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:07,540
I feel like I'm going to die.

911
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:13,540
I feel like I'm going to die.

912
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:15,540

I'm sorry.

918
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:55,540
I can't do it anymore.

919
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:00,540
I can't do it anymore.

920
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:01,460
Ah, g-

921
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:35,460
Ah, that's right, I feel good.

Plus more

926
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:08,000
Ah, no... no... no...

927
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Ouch!

This feels so good.

931
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
This is bad.

932
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
This is bad.

933
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,280
I'm sorry.

934
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Do you feel good?

935
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I want to put it in.

936
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Do you want me to put it in?

937

Yes, put it in.

938

Are you feeling okay?

948
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,580
Phew…

949
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,880
Well, I'll welcome them.

950
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:53,800
It feels nice!

951
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:00,180
No!

952
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,800
Ouch…

953
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:03,000
Mm.

954
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:04,500

Ah, it's cold.

971
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I feel so good.

972
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I feel so good.

973
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I feel so good.

974
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Oh, no. Oh, no. I feel so good.

975
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Mmm, uh!

976
02:36:56,840 --> 02:36:58,420
I'm in trouble.

977
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:00,760
No way...

978
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:05,940
Let's get out!

979
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:07,500
Let's go!

980
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,500
Rika...

981
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:11,500
I'm so tired.

982
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:29,500
I'm sleepy.

983
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:34,500
It feels good.

984
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:39,500
Ah, it feels good.

985
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:41,500
Oh, my God.

I feel so good.

990
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:15,500
It hurts.

991
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:20,500
It hurts.

992
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:22,500
It hurts.

993
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:29,500

It hurts.

995
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:39,500
It's going to hurt.

996
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:40,500
Ouch!

997
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:43,500
Ouch!

998
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:45,500

Feels so nice!

1003
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,040
I can't do this.

1004

I'm so happy.

1016
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:21,040
Mom, I can't. It hurts.

1017
02:42:46,040 --> 02:42:48,340
Ah, ah...

1018
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:51,700
Ah...

1019
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:56,740

Oh, oh, oh!

1023
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:52,460
Oh, oh, oh, whew, whew...

1024
02:43:52,460 --> 02:43:54,560
Oh, oh, oh...

1025
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:56,980
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1026
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:08,120
Oh, oh!

1027
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:10,120
Whoa, whoa!

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1037
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:39,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1038
02:44:39,860 --> 02:44:41,720
A little to the side, came back.

1039
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:02,600
So we're almost there.

1040
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:05,600
Ah, it feels good.

1041

I want more.

1045
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:27,600
Oh, it's so painful.

1046
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:34,600
Oh, it's so painful.

1047
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:41,600
Oh, it's so painful.

I have to這是!

1052
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:50,520
Oh.

1053
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:51,400
No...

1054
02:46:55,420 --> 02:46:56,420
No...

1055
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,880
No...

1056
02:46:59,380 --> 02:47:00,380
I have to....

1057
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:08,740
Yeah.

1058
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:12,740
I feel good.

1059
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:15,740
I feel good.

1060
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:21,740
I want more.

1061
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:31,740
I feel good.

1062
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:33,740
Oh, I see.

1063
02:47:41,740 --> 02:47:43,740
Oh, no.

1064
02:47:43,740 --> 02:47:45,740
It feels so good.

1065
02:47:45,740 --> 02:47:47,740
Electric shock

1066
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:08,980
You feel good?

1067
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:09,940
Yeah

1068
02:48:09,940 --> 02:48:11,400
It'll be fine.

1069
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:19,160
We'll get them in there.

1070
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:21,160
Give me a hug.

1071
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:24,160
We are welling here, our love to share

1072
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:29,160
Today the day where your book really begins

1073
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:35,160
Days were too soon, in the sky we find our roots

1074
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:41,160
We're on a separate way, setting paragraphs

1075
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:45,160
Separated by the same paragraphs

1076
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:51,160
To let your life be one to light the way

1077
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:54,160
Forever and a day

1078
02:51:54,160 --> 02:52:01,160
We'll be best friends as we do today

1079
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:40,160
We're moving on, our life's been opened up

1080
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:46,160
Remember all the times we had together then

1081
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:51,160
Our memories will never fall away

1082
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:26,160
Thank you very much for watching this video.

RUKAWA YUU

1085
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:42,160
Hello, I'm RUKAWA YUU,

1086
02:53:42,160 --> 02:53:46,160
who played the role of Yuu,

1087
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:48,160
in the movie,

1088
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:53,160
which is a daily life of just having sex in a quiet countryside and sweating.

1089
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:56,160
Nice to meet you.

1090
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:59,160
Nice to meet you.

1091
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:04,160
What is the content of this work?

1092
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:15,160
This work is a love drama.

1093
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:21,160
This time, it was hot sex.

1094
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:23,160
How was it?

1095
02:54:23,160 --> 02:54:34,160
It was very hot, but I think I was able to have a hot sex.

1096
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:44,160
Did you find it difficult to act when you were acting?

1097
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:55,160
Even though I knew the story, I had to pretend that I didn't know the story.

1098
02:54:55,160 --> 02:55:05,160
It was tough, but I think I had a good experience.

1099
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:07,160
That's what I wanted to say.

1100
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:25,160
You played the role of memory loss.

1101
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:31,160
Do you have any past that you want to forget?

1102
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:34,160
A past that I want to forget?

1103
02:55:34,160 --> 02:55:39,160
It's something I can't forget, so I forget a lot.

1104
02:55:41,160 --> 02:55:43,160
I don't know.

1105
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:49,160
Do you often forget things?

1106
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:54,160
I do a lot. I can't forget.

1107
02:55:54,160 --> 02:56:06,160
I think you played Yuu this time, but what kind of woman is Yuu, the main character you saw from Yuu?

1108
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:18,160
I thought she was a very pure girl.

1109
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:28,160
Do you have any similarities with Yuu-san?

1110
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:41,160
I don't want to forget.

1111
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:53,160
There is a scene where you forgive your senior.

1112
02:56:53,160 --> 02:57:03,160
Have you ever had an issue with your seniors?

1113
02:57:03,160 --> 02:57:11,160
I don't think I have a senior.

1114
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:31,160
What was the hardest part of this project?

1115
02:57:31,160 --> 02:57:42,160
The most difficult thing for me was to manage my facial expressions.

1116
02:57:45,160 --> 02:57:50,160
What was difficult about managing your facial expressions?

1117
02:57:50,160 --> 02:58:08,160
I thought it would be difficult to make a sad expression or to be surprised.

1118
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:28,160
This time, I think it was a winter shoot, but was it hard?

1119
02:58:28,160 --> 02:58:33,160
That's right. It was cold.

1120
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:45,160
It was hard because it was the opposite of the season.

1121
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:07,160
Do you have a favorite scene?

1122
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:17,160
I have a lot of favorite scenes.

1123
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:22,160
What do you want to do when you grow up?

1124
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:27,160
I want to get along with my childhood friend again.

1125
02:59:27,160 --> 02:59:32,160
That's how I want to develop.

1126
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:35,660
Do you have anything in common as a child?

1127
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:48,720
I have a boy, but I have never had any flirting with boys.

1128
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:54,480
I thought you wouldn't talk.

1129
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:56,840
Then when did you start in school?

1130
02:59:57,500 --> 03:00:00,540
When was my third year in high school?

1131
03:00:00,540 --> 03:00:21,540
What kind of role do you want to play next?

1132
03:00:21,540 --> 03:00:25,540
What kind of role do you want to play?

1133
03:00:25,540 --> 03:00:35,540
I want to play a role that I've never played before.

1134
03:00:35,540 --> 03:00:40,540
For example, what kind of role do you want to play?

1135
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:41,540
For example...

1136
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:43,540
I can't think of anything right now.

1137
03:01:11,540 --> 03:01:18,540
Do you have a situation you want to try?

1138
03:01:18,540 --> 03:01:20,540
A situation?

1139
03:01:26,540 --> 03:01:28,540
A situation is...

1140
03:01:59,540 --> 03:02:00,540
Yeah.

1141
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:15,540
This time, you were in the countryside.

1142
03:02:16,540 --> 03:02:20,540
And your work was love-struck.

1143
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:25,540
What kind of love-struck work would you like to try next?

1144
03:02:25,540 --> 03:02:35,540
I want to try something like a lovey-dovey kind of thing.

1145
03:02:40,540 --> 03:02:46,540
Do you like lovey-dovey sex?

1146
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:58,540
Rather than being intense or painful, I like that kind of feeling.

1147
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:14,540
This time, you were sweating a lot. How do you feel?

1148
03:03:14,540 --> 03:03:17,540
It felt so good.

1149
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:46,540
I'm going.

1150
03:03:46,540 --> 03:03:48,540
I'm going.

1151
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:58,540
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1152
03:04:48,540 --> 03:04:58,540
It's the first time, so I'm still nervous and anxious.

1153
03:05:48,540 --> 03:05:50,540
You guys are so annoying.

1154
03:05:50,540 --> 03:05:52,540
Let's go take a break.

1155
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:54,540
Okay, let's go.

1156
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:56,540
I'm really tired.

1157
03:05:56,540 --> 03:05:58,540
I do have a lot of work to do.

1158
03:05:58,540 --> 03:06:00,540
I'll do my best.

1159
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:02,540
I'll do my best.

1160
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:04,540
I'm sure you are tired.

1161
03:06:04,540 --> 03:06:06,540
I'm sure you are.

1162
03:06:06,540 --> 03:06:08,540
I'm sure you are.

1163
03:06:08,540 --> 03:06:10,540
I'm sure you are.

1164
03:06:10,540 --> 03:06:12,540
I'm sure you are.

1165
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:14,540
I'm sure you are.

1166
03:06:14,540 --> 03:06:16,540
I'm sure you are.

1167
03:06:16,540 --> 03:06:17,540
Go!

1168
03:06:19,540 --> 03:06:20,540
Go!

1169
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:22,540
Go!

1170
03:06:22,540 --> 03:06:23,540
Go!

1171
03:06:23,540 --> 03:06:24,540
Go!

1172
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:25,540
Go!

1173
03:07:25,540 --> 03:07:29,540
How did you feel when you watched the last shoot?

1174
03:07:30,540 --> 03:07:31,540
Yes.

1175
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:46,540
I had a hard time, but I did my best, so I want you to watch it a lot.

1176
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:50,540
Thank you very much.

1177
03:07:50,540 --> 03:07:52,540
Thank you very much.
