1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I just let it go.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I see.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So I might have been hit on the shoulder or the waist.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Could you please look forward a little?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If it hurts, please tell me.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to stretch it out a little bit.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to shake it a little bit.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's warm, but don't you feel uncomfortable?

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, it's okay.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm going to stretch it.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's nice and warm.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Your body gets warm when it's cold.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Your body is very beautiful, but do you do any exercise?

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Exercise? Thank you.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't do much, but sometimes I go to the gym.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's hard to keep going to the gym, isn't it?

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just a little bit.

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How often do you usually massage?

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I've started to get addicted recently.

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's about three times a week.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, so there are various types of tampons.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll try it.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I wish I could find a place to put it in.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'd like you to repeat it.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It feels great.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you very much.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'd like you to open your legs a little.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Excuse me.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think this massage is good.

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, it's my first time.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a body massage.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Just like this.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's move on to the other side.

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm going to run my heart through all the clogged parts.

41
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's solidified.

42
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I guess it's going to be like that if I don't walk.

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We've been living the same life for a long time.

44
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Excuse me.

45
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your buttocks are very stiff.

46
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Is it possible for you to dress up as Yotsunbai?

47
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Yotsunbai?

48
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Please wait a moment. I'll fix the plan.

49
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh, sorry.

50
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Thank you very much.

51
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Please.

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Yes.

53
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Yotsunbai.

54
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,600
Normally.

55
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
You can lower it as it is.

56
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh, yes.

57
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Excuse me.

58
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes, please.

59
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
It's a warm oil. What do you think?

60
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
It feels like it's getting warmer.

61
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
It's good. I have a cold.

62
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
It feels like it's working.

63
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Then I will stretch it a little.

64
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:18,200
There is a little clogging here, so I will loosen it a little.

65
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
It's a little ticklish.

66
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
It's a place where lymph nodes are gathered, so it may tickle.

67
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm sorry, I moved.

68
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
It's okay.

69
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Yes, thank you.

70
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Then, shall we go straight to Aomuke?

71
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Aomuke.

72
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Yes.

73
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
By the way,

74
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Yes.

75
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Now, in the rotation campaign,

76
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
You can perform surgery while applying steam to your face.

77
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
How is it?

78
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Steam?

79
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Yes.

80
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
You can perform surgery while experiencing the aroma of the aroma.

81
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Oh, I'd like to try it.

82
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
May I?

83
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I think you'll fall asleep soon.

84
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Oh, is that so?

85
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh, is it because it's warm?

86
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,200
This is the scent of herbs I'm using this time.

87
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Oh, it's a nice scent.

88
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll use it as it is.

89
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Yes.

90
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
It's sweet and my favorite scent.

91
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Oh, really?

92
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
If the steam is too strong, please tell me.

93
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Yes

94
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,800
I think it will gradually hit

95
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Yes

96
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,200
I will continue to use the oil

97
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,700
Please

98
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Excuse me.

100
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
It's a little painful, isn't it?

101
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I'm going to loosen it a little.

102
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
Yes.

103
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
The steam is coming out.

104
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
How is the scent?

105
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
It's amazing.

106
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
It's a good scent.

107
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
It's a good scent.

108
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
It's a good scent.

109
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
It's a good scent.

110
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
It smells really good.

111
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
It's warm, too.

112
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I see.

113
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Please relax as it is.

114
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:50,700
I'm going to change the massage a little and do it from the chest again.

115
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Yes.

116
00:12:51,700 --> 00:13:11,700
It's a little gentle massage, so please relax.

117
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Is it a little hot in the room?

118
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I think it's okay because it's just a massage that makes your skin better.

119
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Oh, that's right.

120
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm going to relax, but my skin feels very sensitive, so if you have any problems, please let me know.

121
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
I understand.

122
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Your back is moving. Are you okay?

123
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
Are you ok?

124
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Yes.

125
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Does it tickle?

126
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Please take a deep breath.

127
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Yes.

128
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Breathe in and out.

129
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,700
I'm going to massage the lymph nodes.

130
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Yes.

131
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Excuse me.

132
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
I'm going to massage the lymph nodes.

133
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,700
Excuse me.

134
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,700
How is it to be touched with your fingertips?

135
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Please take a deep breath.

136
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,700
I'll press a little harder.

137
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm sorry.

138
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
I'm going to massage your other side as well.

139
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,700
I think your body is going to get hot right now.

140
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,700
I'm going to give you a massage.

141
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Massage?

142
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
I'm not trying to do it.

143
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,700
I...

144
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
I...

145
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
I...

146
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I...

147
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
I...

148
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I...

149
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
I...

150
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I...

151
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
I'll take it off because it's dirty

152
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Please tell me if it's noisy

153
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
What's wrong?

154
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
What's wrong?

155
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Is it better to massage here?

156
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
I'm sorry.

157
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
It's okay.

158
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Let's rest a little longer.

159
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm sorry.

160
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
I'm sorry.

161
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
I'm sorry.

162
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
I'm sorry.

163
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
I'm sorry.

164
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
I'm sorry.

165
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm going to cry.

166
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm going to cry.

167
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,700
You're the one who gets the coldest of the coldest.

168
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
That's why I'm holding you.

169
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
I'm sorry.

170
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm sorry.

171
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm sorry.

172
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I'm sorry.

173
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
I'm sorry.

174
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm sorry.

175
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm sorry.

176
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm sorry.

177
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
I'm sorry.

178
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
I'm sorry.

179
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm sorry.

180
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Ah...

181
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Ah...

182
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Ah...

183
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Ah...

184
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Ah...

185
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Ah...

186
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:43,700
Is it a little hard?

187
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Oh, that's right.

188
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
You are busy with your work.

189
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:26,700
I'm going to do it all over your face, so can you turn your face to the side?

190
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:46,700
I use facial steamer to moisturize my face.

191
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,700
I think it will be more effective if you rub it.

192
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
OK.

193
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
I'm going to massage your lymph nodes.

194
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,700
OK.

195
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,700
I'm going to open your back a little.

196
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
Thank you very much.

197
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

198
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,700
I'm sorry I didn't know you could do this.

199
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,700
You know, I'm not a good person.

200
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,700
I'm sorry.

201
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,700
I'm sorry.

202
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,700
I'm sorry.

203
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,700
I'm sorry.

204
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,700
I'm sorry.

205
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,700
I'm sorry.

206
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
I'm sorry.

207
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,700
I'm sorry.

208
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,700
I'm sorry.

209
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,700
I'm sorry.

210
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,700
I'm sorry.

211
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,700
I'm sorry.

212
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,700
Ah

213
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:27,700
Do you often go to places like this?

214
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,700
No, I don't really go to places like this.

215
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,700
Really?

216
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:40,700
So this time you happened to choose our store.

217
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,700
Yes, I saw it on the flyer.

218
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:47,700
Oh, thank you. It's a new store, right?

219
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,700
Yes.

220
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,700
Thank you.

221
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:58,140
It's free right now, so you can get it done for free.

222
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,580
That's nice, Tomomi.

223
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:05,620
I hope you can use this opportunity and experience it.

224
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:09,700
If you like it, you can visit us.

225
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,700
I hope you like it.

226
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,700
Excuse me.

227
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,700
Have you ever used aroma oil?

228
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,700
No, I haven't.

229
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,700
Yes.

230
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,700
This is the store.

231
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,700
Yes.

232
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:09,700
I use the original special aroma oil.

233
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,700
Oh.

234
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,700
Facial steamer.

235
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,700
Yes.

236
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,700
It has a facial effect.

237
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:16,700
Oh.

238
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,700
I use the aroma oil on the facial steamer.

239
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,700
Oh.

240
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:21,700
Thank you very much.

241
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,700
I also try that.

242
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,700
Oh.

243
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,700
Is it free?

244
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,700
Yes, of course.

245
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:36,940
We can do it in a special way, so if you're interested, I'd like to try it.

246
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:39,940
I see. I'll prepare that as well.

247
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:40,940
Yes.

248
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,940
It's a cold wound, isn't it?

249
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,940
It's a cold wound, isn't it?

250
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:45,940
It's a cold wound, isn't it?

251
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:49,940
I'm going to do the other side as well.

252
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,940
It's a cold wound, isn't it?

253
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:54,940
It's easy to get cold even if you do it like this.

254
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:32,940
It has a good smell. It has a relaxing effect and a beauty effect.

255
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:39,940
If you take a deep breath and breathe in, you will be able to feel it better.

256
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:45,940
It does have a good smell.

257
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,940
Thank you very much.

258
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,940
I'm going to massage your head.

259
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,940
I'm going to massage your head.

260
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:42,940
It's very effective.

261
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,940
The other side.

262
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,940
Hmm

263
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,940
Hmm

264
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,940
Hmm

265
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,940
Hmm

266
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:29,940
Hmm

267
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,940
Hmm

268
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,940
Hmm

269
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:38,940
I'm sorry.

270
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,940
No, no, no, no!

271
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:40,940
Yes, it was written that it was free.

272
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,940
Please try it.

273
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:51,940
If you like it, I think you can go home.

274
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,940
I'm going to massage your whole face.

275
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:18,940
Okay.

276
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:21,940
Would you like me to massage your face?

277
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:25,940
I'm going to massage your whole face.

278
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:26,940
Okay.

279
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:29,940
Do you want me to massage your face like this?

280
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:30,940
Yes.

281
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:48,940
I'm going to massage your whole face.

282
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:56,940
I'm going to apply it to the whole face.

283
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:11,940
Is there any part of your body that you are interested in?

284
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:15,940
I'm interested in the whole body.

285
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:24,940
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

286
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:27,940
Please listen carefully.

287
02:02:57,940 --> 02:02:59,940
How about it?

288
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,940
Is it expensive?

289
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:03,940
It's free.

290
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:05,940
I see.

291
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:07,940
Please.

292
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,940
I see.

293
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:11,940
I'm going to get ready.

294
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:47,940
Please tell me if it was hot.

295
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,940
Oh, yes, I got it.

296
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:51,940
Yes, I do.

297
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:52,940
Really?

298
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:53,940
Yes.

299
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:54,940
I see.

300
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:55,940

I see.

303
02:04:57,940 --> 02:04:58,940
I see.

304
02:04:58,940 --> 02:04:59,940
I see.

305
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:00,940
I see.

306
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:01,940
I see.

307
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:02,940
I see.

308
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:03,940
I see.

309
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:08,940
I think you can do it, so please give it a try.

310
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,940
This is the end of the video.
