1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,350
Is this recording?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,870
I'm Rukawa.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,070
It's embarrassing.

5
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:23,330
I'm going to the studio for shooting today.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,610
Let's go.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,480
It's cold today.

8
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:40,480
I forgot. Today's clothes are like this.

9
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:46,760
White knit, white down, black short pants.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,220
It's cold. Can you see it?

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,800
Let's go.

12
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,801
Let's get started.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,960
Today's shooting is...

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,140
It's embarrassing to talk to myself.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,960
This is the first time I'm
doing this with a selfie stick.

16
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:10,240
Today's shooting is...

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,960
It's supposed to be a staycation.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,740
It's a live staycation.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,480
What do you think? I cut my hair.

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,880
This is the first time I've cut
my hair and taken a picture.

21
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:39,540
This is the first time
for me to use this app.

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,940
I always use the app for selfie.

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,420
It's weird.

24
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,040
It's like, my face is like this.

25
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,041
What the hell is this?

26
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,100
There was a cat earlier.

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
There was a stray cat.

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
It was so cute.

29
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,860
Black and white and brown.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,060
It's time to meet up.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,260
Let's go.

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,060
I'm nervous.

33
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,360
My heart is pounding.

34
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,830
It's probably around here.

35
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,140
Oh, there it is.

36
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:01,640
Today's studio.

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
It says Prestige.

38
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,400
Well, I'd like to go inside.

39
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,380
Thank you for your hard work.

40
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,125
What?

41
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:34,665
Good morning.

42
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,900
Nobody's here.

43
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,050
What's going on?

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Nobody's here.

45
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,640
Good morning.

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Nobody's here.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,420
Hey, what are you doing?

48
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,840
What are you doing?

49
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,620
What's that?

50
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,420
What?

51
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:36,050
Oh, wait!

52
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,950
Oh, my God.

53
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,050
I was really surprised.

54
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,230
You didn't ask me, did you?

55
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,090
No, I didn't ask you all of a sudden.

56
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,190
What did you ask me today?

57
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,710
Today, I'm going to stay at your house.

58
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,230
I'm going to stay at your house.

59
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,730
You didn't ask me when I could
stay at your house, did you?

60
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,390
No, I didn't.

61
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,470
I didn't ask you all of a sudden.

62
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,490
I thought he wouldn't talk for a long time.

63
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,090
I'm sorry.
I was so surprised that I was sweating.

64
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,420
I'm so happy that my son is happy.

65
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,420
I'm so happy that I don't know what to do.

66
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:54,460
I don't want to be alone.

67
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,440
I want to be a happy family with my son.

68
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Oh.

69
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Oh.

70
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,870
Oh Oh.

71
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,740
Um.

72
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,860
Oh.

73
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,220
Um I'm so hungry.

74
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm so hungry.

75
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,300
She is getting harder and harder.

76
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm so hungry.

77
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I'm so hungry.

78
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,430
I'm so hungry.

79
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm sorry.

80
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,120
You're too soft.

81
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,920
You're wet.

82
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,140
I'm sorry.

83
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,520
You have a butt.

84
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Ah!

85
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Ah!

86
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,075
Ah!

87
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,530
Ah!

88
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,090
Ah!

89
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Ah!

90
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,820
Ah!

91
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:43,840
Ah!

92
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,760
Ah!

93
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,761
Ah!

94
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,500
She's whining.

95
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,780
Ah!

96
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,720
Ah!

97
00:11:52,721 --> 00:12:09,140
No, no, no, no, no!

98
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,630
The baby is a little out of breath.

99
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,110
Oh, the baby is out of breath.

100
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,710
It's been a long time since
he's been out of breath.

101
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:01,270
Yes, he's out of breath.

102
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
He's been out of breath for a long time.

103
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,870
Oh, baby, you're tired.

104
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,871
Are you tired?

105
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,890
I want a drink.

106
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:07,891
You're so cute.

107
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,790
It's good, it's good.

108
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,490
Aah!

109
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,970
You're not crying, are you?

110
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,830
You're not crying.

111
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,530
There, there, there,
there, there, there, there.

112
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,490
Aah!

113
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:50,491
Aah!

114
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,550
It's so good.

115
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,551
It's delicious.

116
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,590
Is it delicious?

117
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,390
Look at this.

118
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,590
Yes, it is.

119
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:29,115
Is it good?

120
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,610
Yes, it is.

121
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,850
It is really good.

122
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,170
Yes.

123
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,050
You are doing good.

124
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,290
You are doing good.

125
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,370
Sit down, Chimpanzee.

126
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:26,400
It's warm.

127
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,240
It feels good.

128
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
Is it warm?

129
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,950
It's warm.

130
00:15:45,770 --> 00:16:04,600
It was more comfortable than I thought.

131
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:37,060
I think the baby is more
comfortable than the mom.

132
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,700
I'm happy that my son likes the baby.

133
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
I couldn't help crying.

134
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,350
I hadn't felt so good at
the hospital for a while.

135
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,410
Mom got a call and I visited her.

136
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,940
Mom is carrying my dad to the hospital.

137
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,850
She is also giving birth to a baby girl.

138
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,360
No, don't do it.

139
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm going.

140
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm going to go.

141
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,580
You can do it.

142
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,581
Are you okay?

143
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Are you okay?

144
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:45,320
I can't do it.

145
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:08,670
It feels good.

146
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,070
It feels so good!

147
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,950
It feels so good!

148
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,480
Ah, it feels good.

149
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,760
Everyone is so warm.

150
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:25,720
Ah, it feels good.

151
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,540
No, no, no.

152
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm going.

153
00:20:41,175 --> 00:21:09,190
Ah, I'm going.

154
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:12,950
I'm going.

155
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
I'm going.

156
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,190
It feels good.

157
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,530
It feels good.

158
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,080
The baby is in the middle of the toilet.

159
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,680
So I'm washing her.

160
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,810
I'm focused on her and washing her.

161
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,090
It's like I'm doing
something, but it's not!

162
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,270
I'm filming, I'm filming!

163
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,610
I'm filming, I'm filming!

164
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,380
The baby is in the middle of the toilet.

165
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,810
I can't do it anymore.

166
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:45,811
I can't do it anymore.

167
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,830
I'm going to die.

168
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,011
Ahh... Ahh...

169
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,830
You're not gonna get up?

170
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
No.

171
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,820
You're not gonna get up?

172
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
No.

173
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,890
You're not gonna get up?

174
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,350
No.

175
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,650
Ahh...

176
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,090
Ahh... Ahh... Oh, it feels good.

177
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,460
It's getting better.

178
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,640
It's getting better.

179
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,490
I'm sorry.

180
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,940
It feels good.

181
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,320
It feels good.

182
00:26:45,620 --> 00:27:02,640
I'm sorry.

183
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
I'm sorry.

184
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm sorry.

185
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,870
Are you okay?

186
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,910
I feel good.

187
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:25,020
I feel good.

188
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,640
I feel good.

189
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,220
What is that?

190
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,220
I feel good.

191
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
I'm sorry.

192
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:05,890
I'm sorry.

193
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,630
I'm sorry.

194
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,230
I'm sorry.

195
00:29:49,330 --> 00:30:11,930
The day she was
born... Mother's voice.

196
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,240
I'm so happy.

197
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,340
I'm so happy.

198
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:22,840
I feel so good.

199
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm going to sleep.

200
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm going to sleep.

201
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,130
Oh, God.

202
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,070
Hey, Aty.

203
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,930
Come on, relax.

204
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,810
I wanna go inside.

205
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:50,890
You do?

206
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,630
Go inside, please.

207
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,970
Please.

208
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,690
It's so hot.

209
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,750
It's so hot.

210
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:30,510
It's amazing.

211
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,540
Yeah….

212
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,171
※I'm not a spy I'm scared.

213
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Yeah, you're fine.

214
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:14,470
It's okay.

215
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:23,410
It's okay, it's okay.

216
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,290
It's okay.

217
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,160
It's hot.

218
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,380
Wow, it's warm.

219
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,540
It feels so good.

220
00:39:54,255 --> 00:40:12,830
It feels so good.

221
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,940
It feels so good.

222
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,880
It's so good.

223
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,100
It's so good.

224
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,440
Give me more.

225
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,500
Give me more.

226
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:24,160
Oh, it hurts.

227
00:41:28,380 --> 00:42:17,990
Oh, it hurts.

228
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:21,210
You had a lot of them, didn't you?

229
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,050
Yes.

230
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,430
Did you like them?

231
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,530
Yes.

232
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,730
Let me touch them.

233
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,950
Spread your legs.

234
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,270
Sit down.

235
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Wow.

236
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,480
There are a lot of them.

237
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,420
It's for three people.

238
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,380
Wow.

239
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,770
It was warm.

240
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,470
Was it?

241
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,810
Yes.

242
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,550
Did you feel good when you were kicked out?

243
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,030
No, not at all.

244
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,210
How did you feel when you
were suddenly kicked out?

245
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,930
I was surprised, but I felt good.

246
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,830
You were kicked out right away.

247
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,250
But the fun is yet to come.

248
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:17,570
Oh, there's more?

249
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,870
It's just started, isn't it?

250
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:20,870
I see.

251
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,190
What are you listening to?

252
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,810
Otomari?

253
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
It's just started.

254
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,790
It's just started, isn't it?

255
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,030
It's just started, isn't it?

256
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,090
It may come out suddenly again.

257
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,950
I'm scared.

258
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,410
It may come out suddenly from somewhere.

259
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,850
What is it?

260
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,070
It's on the left.

261
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:48,590
This is a fun corner.

262
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,430
Let's have fun together.

263
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,310
Is that Ryujin?

264
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,330
There is Ryujin.

265
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,790
It's great.

266
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,850
It's big and long.

267
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,390
It's great.

268
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,990
Please express how long it is.

269
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,830
It's this long.

270
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,570
I wonder how many people there are.

271
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:15,110
It's so long.

272
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,650
Were you surprised?

273
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,130
Yes, I was surprised.

274
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,790
It looks good on you.

275
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,470
Does it?

276
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,930
It matches your outfit today.

277
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,030
It does.

278
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:27,910
It's like a celebrity.

279
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,710
Thank you.

280
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,240
It's great.

281
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:38,480
It's amazing.

282
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,140
This way.

283
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
This way?

284
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,400
It's so shiny.

285
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Let's take a picture.

286
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,980
Okay.

287
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,780
It's not started yet.

288
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,680
It's not started yet.

289
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,180
Please press the button.

290
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,460
Here?

291
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,040
Yes.

292
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,600
Let's go.

293
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,380
Has it arrived?

294
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,560
It's moving!

295
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
It's moving!

296
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,860
Let's go!

297
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Let's go!

298
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Yay!

299
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
Yay!

300
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,780
What is that?

301
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,020
I got a bit of a shock.

302
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
What is that?

303
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,180
It's funny.

304
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:35,181
I don't know what to say.

305
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,930
Where do you like to go
when you go on a date?

306
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,020
When I go on a date?

307
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,540
If I'm with someone I
like, I like to go anywhere.

308
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,760
I like to go home or go for a drive.

309
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,980
I like to go out for a meal.

310
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,540
I think so, too.

311
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,940
It's good to have someone you like.

312
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,620
Do you want to go to a place like this?

313
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,060
I want to go to an amusement park.

314
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,760
I want to go anywhere.

315
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,920
Do you have a place you want to go?

316
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,340
I don't have a place I want to go.

317
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,960
Do you want to be with that person?

318
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,300
I want to go anywhere.

319
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,640
Don't break it.

320
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,700
I can't put it in.

321
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,180
I see.

322
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,380
I can't put it in.

323
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,560
It's wonderful.

324
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,180
I'm sure you'll take me anywhere.

325
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,320
Really?

326
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,480
I'm sure you'll take me anywhere.

327
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,720
I'll take you to my house.

328
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,500
It's a little cold, isn't it?

329
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,580
Yes.

330
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,700
After all, there are men who want
to walk with such a cute person.

331
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,540
Is that so?

332
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,880
If it's just a house,
it's a little wasteful.

333
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,640
I want to show off.

334
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,160
Is that what you mean?

335
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,180
Yes.

336
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,220
What is today's theme?

337
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,480
Today's theme is...

338
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,360
It's cold, but I'll show my legs.

339
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,340
That's what it is.

340
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,540
That's the best.

341
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,660
Your legs look long.

342
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,440
I'm happy.

343
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,220
I'm barefoot.

344
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,516
Even though it's cold, There are a lot of
people who don't wear underwear, right?

345
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,540
Yes.

346
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,280
I'm happy to take a video like this.

347
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,780
Oh, really?

348
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Yes.

349
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,260
Thank you for the massage.

350
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,620
There are a lot of people wearing
short underwear like this, right?

351
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,360
Yes, yes.

352
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,760
The bottom?

353
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,300
The bottom is pretty good.

354
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,980
It's pretty good.

355
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,120
Please show me a little.

356
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,160
I took it off right away.

357
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,420
Oh, really?

358
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,260
I want you to show me
that you're wearing it.

359
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,040
Someone... Yes, yes, yes.

360
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,660
Who?

361
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,740
I was like, this way!

362
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,680
I was like, this way!

363
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,020
And I got in.

364
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,620
I'm a little embarrassed.

365
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
This one.

366
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,160
This one.

367
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,420
It's the best.

368
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,560
It looks like a panty.

369
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,340
It's embarrassing.

370
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:12,740
It's a panty.

371
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:13,741
This is a real limousine.

372
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,260
Wait a minute.

373
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,420
Is there such a limousine in the limousine?

374
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,280
Is there such a limousine?

375
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,400
This is not a normal limousine.

376
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,660
This is a fancy limousine.

377
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,060
Do you like to spin?

378
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,860
Yes, I like it.

379
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
Is the sound okay?

380
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,030
Can't you see outside?

381
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,830
I just noticed.

382
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,890
I can't see outside.

383
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,730
I think so.

384
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,610
Can you see outside?

385
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,930
Can you see from Yu-chan?

386
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,450
I can see.

387
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,330
It's dangerous if you can see.

388
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,910
It's a service.

389
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,490
No, no, no.

390
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,710
You're so mean.

391
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,130
I'm not.

392
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,750
Do you have a problem with that?

393
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,050
No, I'm embarrassed,
so I don't want to say it.

394
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,130
You're going to do it, aren't you?

395
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,750
You're going to do it, aren't you?

396
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,010
I don't want to say it.

397
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,690
You don't want to say it.

398
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:49,170
I don't want to say it.

399
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:50,891
I'm embarrassed, so I don't want to say it.

400
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,330
Where do you hit?

401
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,050
Here?

402
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:56,690
Where?

403
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:57,770
Yes, it is.

404
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,710
How do you feel?

405
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:14,980
It's embarrassing.

406
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,540
You were quiet a while ago.

407
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,040
Yes, I was.

408
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,560
Were you?

409
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,580
Yes.

410
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
How do you feel?

411
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,540
I'm getting hot.

412
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,720
Have you ever done something
erotic while riding a car?

413
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,820
No, I haven't.

414
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:51,440
It's my first time in a car.

415
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,441
How do you feel?

416
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,580
It feels good.

417
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,720
Cars move on their own.

418
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,440
It's like a temple.

419
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,280
Can I get in?

420
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,760
No, you can't.

421
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,360
Oh, it's coming out.

422
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,060
Oh, it's out.

423
00:51:12,061 --> 00:51:13,061
Oh, she's out.

424
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,060
You're eating a lot.

425
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,820
That's a lot.

426
00:51:27,380 --> 00:52:18,920
It feels good.

427
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,680
I'm going to get a tattoo.

428
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,196
You got a tattoo on your hand.

429
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,220
I got a tattoo.

430
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,160
You got a tattoo?

431
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,700
I'm sad, but I'm going to die.

432
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,560
I'm usually an ED.

433
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,860
Really?

434
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,680
I'm going to be the first to die.

435
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,720
You were the first one
to jump out of the car.

436
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,600
It was too cute, so I took it.

437
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,200
What's your favorite shape of your penis?

438
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,980
I don't know.

439
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,720
A normal size?

440
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,700
A little bigger than normal?

441
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:55,780
I think so, too.

442
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:01,060
I like this style.

443
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,640
I like it, too.

444
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:06,540
How do you like it?

445
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,420
I like it, too.

446
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:09,560
Do you?

447
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:10,561
Yes.

448
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,840
Your style is beautiful.

449
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,220
Yes, it is.

450
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,400
It's thin.

451
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,240
Wait a minute, I'm sweating.

452
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,760
Sweating is delicious.

453
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,480
Sweating is delicious.

454
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,860
I'm sorry, I'm sweating.

455
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,060
This swimsuit looks good on you.

456
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,760
Wait a minute.

457
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:44,761
It's really beautiful.

458
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,040
Come here.

459
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,420
The underwear and the body
are perfect for a limousine.

460
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,380
It's really beautiful.

461
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,660
It's comfortable.

462
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,340
The face is beautiful.

463
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,910
Have you ever done this in a car?

464
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:09,530
No, I haven't.

465
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,010
I want to do this.

466
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:14,490
I want to touch it.

467
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,040
It's wet.

468
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,620
It's wet.

469
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,340
I don't know.

470
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,070
I don't know.

471
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:51,770
Does it feel good?

472
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,370
I don't think so.

473
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,450
While looking at the camera.

474
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,060
He is still a baby.

475
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,500
He is still a baby.

476
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:44,380
He is still a baby.

477
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:10,840
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

478
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,990
It's so hot.

479
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:36,991
You need to drink more.

480
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,010
It's hot.

481
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,210
What's hot?

482
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,910
My mouth is hot.

483
00:59:55,911 --> 00:59:56,911
I'm so hungry.

484
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,010
What are you doing?

485
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,690
I'm being hit by a car.

486
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:06,691
Where?

487
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,810
In front of me.

488
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,290
You're being hit by a car
in the middle of the road?

489
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,470
Yes.

490
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:22,190
Look this way.

491
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,110
I'm scared, En-chan.

492
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:32,810
Let's go.

493
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:42,010
This is dangerous.

494
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,610
It's getting bigger.

495
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:00,750
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

496
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,550
Treasure.

497
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:18,030
No more.

498
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,190
I feel so good.

499
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,010
I'm dying.

500
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,750
Captain!

501
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,550
Egg!

502
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:51,990
Thank you.

503
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,660
It's hot.

504
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,740
It's hot.

505
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,120
It's hot.

506
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,420
It's hot.

507
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,860
I'm going to sleep.

508
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,100
I feel good.

509
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,980
I'm going to sleep.

510
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,740
I'm going to sleep.

511
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,280
I'm going to sleep.

512
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:58,281
Are you going?

513
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,580
Yes, I'm going.

514
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Are you sure?

515
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,900
Take care of yourself.

516
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,220
I'm going.

517
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,680
I'm sorry.

518
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,580
You're out a lot.

519
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,360
I'm excited.

520
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,740
I didn't mean to get out.

521
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:36,380
I don't know why, but it felt good.

522
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,580
Did you feel good?

523
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,540
I'll wipe your face.

524
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,800
Thank you very much.

525
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,300
Your face was a little cold.

526
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,740
Thank you very much.

527
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,940
You told me to take it out.

528
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,060
I just felt like that.

529
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:02,000
You look like you're in a good mood.

530
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:13,300
Show me your hand.

531
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:14,301
I'll show you.

532
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,960
Wow, there's a lot.

533
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,280
It looks like a meringue.

534
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,260
The lower and upper mouth are very good.

535
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,400
There were a lot earlier.

536
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,940
There's a lot again.

537
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,440
I'm asking when you're going to poop.

538
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:48,136
I've heard that it's good even
if you don't do it many times.

539
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,160
Is that so?

540
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,720
This stay?

541
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,556
I've heard that it's good even
if you don't do it many times.

542
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,580
That's great.

543
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,340
I want to poop.

544
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,420
It's okay.

545
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:18,130
It's so beautiful.

546
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:18,230
It's so pretty!

547
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,850
Isn't it great here?

548
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,530
It's so pretty!

549
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:25,210
You said you like shiny
places, so I came here.

550
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:26,970
It's so pretty!

551
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,361
How do you like this illumination?

552
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,870
It's so nice!

553
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,501
Do you like men who
take you to different places?

554
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,050
Yes, I do.

555
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,670
I like men who lead me.

556
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,731
Why do you want to be confessed to?

557
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,570
Confessed to?

558
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:45,571
You want me to do that?

559
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:47,366
Do you want it to be straight forward?

560
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,790
I want it to be straight forward.

561
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,630
I want it to be simple.

562
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,590
I want it to be something
like... I like you.

563
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:56,910
Please go out with me.

564
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,950
Do you want your partner to do it for you?

565
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,030
That's right.

566
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,546
I want to make him turn around.

567
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,690
I want to make him chase me.

568
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,550
I want to receive it.

569
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,130
What?

570
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:23,110
I had a lot of fun today
and I fell in love with you.

571
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,270
Will you go out with me?

572
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,200
What's your answer?

573
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,820
Of course!

574
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,940
Of course!

575
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,100
Of course!

576
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,160
It's dangerous.

577
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,400
It's dangerous.

578
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,320
I was surprised.

579
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,260
Do you put your arms
together when you go on a date?

580
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:55,315
Yes, I do.

581
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,380
How about this? I'll hold it.

582
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,740
Thank you.

583
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,840
That's good.

584
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,880
Like this.

585
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,180
Like this.

586
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,280
Do you put your arms
together when you hold hands?

587
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,960
Yes, I do.

588
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:08,940
I like it.

589
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:10,120
That's good.

590
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,060
It's nice.
I can't stand it if you do this to me.

591
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,240
Is it good to come here on a date?

592
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,920
Yes, it's good. It's quiet.

593
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,420
It's calm now.

594
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,060
It's not noisy.

595
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,360
This atmosphere suits you.

596
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,150
Yes, it's good.

597
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,080
In a place like this,

598
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
secretly.

599
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,240
Here?

600
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,801
Here Here, here, here
Because there are people,

601
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,820
they will definitely find
out It's okay, it's okay.

602
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,420
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

603
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:09,820
It's embarrassing I did it
It's embarrassing I did it.

604
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,900
Look at those two.

605
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:18,540
They are staring at us They are staring
at us Scary You seem to be envious of her.

606
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,680
Why don't you call one of them?

607
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,200
One of them?

608
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,100
One of them?

609
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,860
I can't see them.

610
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,080
Here they are.

611
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:31,010
Thank you.

612
01:09:31,495 --> 01:09:32,495
With both hands.

613
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,420
With both hands.

614
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:37,820
Wait, wait.

615
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,960
Someone is coming.

616
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,440
No, no, no.

617
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,660
Someone is coming.

618
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,680
I'm so envious.

619
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:47,860
If you go there, both
of us will notice you.

620
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,600
Both of us?

621
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,660
Yes.

622
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,200
I'll be there.

623
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,621
It's cute that the tip
of your nose is cold.

624
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,700
It's cold.

625
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:05,980
I'll be cold again.

626
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,680
That's great.

627
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,580
I'll be cold again.

628
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,640
It's cold.

629
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,380
Do you like Korean food?

630
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:19,620
Do you like it?

631
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:21,385
Yes, I do.

632
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,500
This is marmalade, isn't it?

633
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,480
Don't you need the spicy one?

634
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:33,880
No, I don't.

635
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:34,400
Are you going to eat it as it is?

636
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,180
Yes, I'm going to eat it as it is.

637
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:39,980
Let's eat.

638
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,860
How is it?

639
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:50,640
It's delicious.

640
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,900
Do you want to eat it as it is?

641
01:10:53,901 --> 01:11:00,300
Tuna and avocado go well together.

642
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,380
It's delicious.

643
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,280
It goes well with Korean seaweed.

644
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,740
It's good.

645
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,160
It's delicious.

646
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
It's good.

647
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,240
It's good.

648
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,520
What is this drink?

649
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:22,521
What are you drinking?

650
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,980
Grapefruit Sour.

651
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,320
There are many sour drinks.

652
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,800
There are many sour drinks I
don't drink beer and highball.

653
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,940
I drink Japanese
sake Japanese sake?

654
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,080
Soju?

655
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:45,840
This is Japanese
sake I don't like it

656
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:51,580
I have drunk it This is delicious
It's easy to drink, isn't it?

657
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,260
I can smell it.

658
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,040
It's easy to drink.

659
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:08,860
Thank you.

660
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,200
Is it good?

661
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:10,860
Yes, it's good.

662
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,420
It's still good.

663
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,400
It's still good.

664
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,880
It's a high level.

665
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,240
It's a high level.

666
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:18,241
The beer is expensive.

667
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,800
Do you know the sake from Okinawa?

668
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,020
Yes.

669
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:25,200
Awamori.

670
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,860
I drank a lot of that as well.

671
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,160
It was easy to drink.

672
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,580
What kind of person do you like?

673
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,000
What do you mean?

674
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:44,700
I like a person who is
kind and drinks with me.

675
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:46,860
I see, so there are people who calm down.

676
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,920
Even if I don't say
anything, it's like air.

677
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,560
It's like air?

678
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,520
It's like air, but in a good way.

679
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,320
In a good way.

680
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,400
When I'm speechless, I
think about what to say.

681
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,000
If you're dating, it's
going to be like that.

682
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:06,850
What do you think?

683
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,080
You're pretty careful.

684
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,700
I wonder if I'll be careful at first.

685
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:25,500
What do you think about
this kind of sexiness in private?

686
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:29,260
In private?

687
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,920
While eating?

688
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,300
No, not at all.

689
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,420
What?

690
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,900
What did you say?

691
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,700
Nothing.

692
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:40,701
I don't know.

693
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,100
You don't know about that kind of world.

694
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,920
You are a little stupid.

695
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,180
I said I was a self-sufficient person.

696
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,040
No, no, no, no.

697
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,060
I get it.

698
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,220
Did you get it?

699
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,880
It's the opposite of what I said.

700
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,920
No, it's not like that at all.

701
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:59,540
It's kind of...

702
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
No.

703
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,600
I like this kind of thing.

704
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,480
But do you like to be blamed?

705
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,980
I like to dance, so I did
a neck-tightening check.

706
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,240
That's amazing.

707
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,620
I like it.

708
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:18,340
But I was beaten too much once.

709
01:14:19,715 --> 01:14:21,120
I got a scar here.

710
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,671
It's like a menstrual cramp.

711
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,140
Yes, it's like a menstrual cramp.

712
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,260
I was in a hurry.

713
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,160
You're asking too much.

714
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,360
You should be more conscious.

715
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,720
Is that so?

716
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:34,721
What do you mean?

717
01:14:36,615 --> 01:14:39,300
Because if you do too much,
you will lose consciousness.

718
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,120
Dangerous.

719
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:42,520
Dangerous.

720
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,600
It's really dangerous.

721
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:49,900
So after that, I decided to quit.

722
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,360
It's hard to make a good plan.

723
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,700
I'm scared.

724
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,500
So it's an M.

725
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,300
I think it's a five-star type M.

726
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:01,480
I usually don't do that.

727
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,560
You don't do that?

728
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:06,880
You look good when you do that.

729
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,860
I think so.

730
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,380
I'll eat Ebiten.

731
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:29,010
It's good.

732
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,770
I don't know.

733
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:49,730
How many people have you dated?

734
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:56,290
I've dated only one
person the same age as me.

735
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,810
But I've dated someone
older than me for 3 days.

736
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:02,110
Have you?

737
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,050
I don't remember.

738
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,730
So you didn't have a lot
of respect for him, did you?

739
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:15,750
No, I didn't.

740
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,501
Because he was already dead?

741
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,890
Yeah, he wasn't a nice guy.

742
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:29,571
So you had a good relationship with
him, and then you had sex with him?

743
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,020
Yeah, I did.

744
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,260
Oh, I see.
So you had a good relationship with him.

745
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,380
It's a strange and memorable place.

746
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,880
What?

747
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,210
It's a memorable place.

748
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,760
A memorable place?

749
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,360
It's a strange place.

750
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:49,870
Yeah, it's memorable.

751
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,840
I wonder where it is.

752
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:54,841
I don't know.

753
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,060
But...

754
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:58,740
I don't know.

755
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:00,700
The one I dated before

756
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,680
and the one before the trip.

757
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,720
Before the trip?

758
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,800
What was it like?

759
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,680
What do you mean?

760
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:09,920
Before the trip,

761
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,380
it's normal to be in a hotel, right?

762
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,860
Is it normal to be in a hotel?

763
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,700
Is it normal to be in a hotel?

764
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:19,380
It's normal to record in a hotel.

765
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:19,960
I see.

766
01:17:19,961 --> 01:17:24,600
But it's a different
environment than usual.

767
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:25,960
It's not at home.

768
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,600
It's in the country.

769
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,960
It's in the country.

770
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:34,860
For example, I went to
a hot spring hotel there.

771
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:40,060
And I had sex in a private bath.

772
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,900
I've never done that.

773
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,440
Did you have sex in a private bath?

774
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:46,441
It's normal.

775
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,380
You are good at it.

776
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:49,940
You are good at it.

777
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,580
I'm kidding.

778
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
I'm kidding.

779
01:17:58,495 --> 01:18:00,790
It's different from the one
you eat in a restaurant.

780
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,890
I ate it when I was a student.

781
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,930
I didn't eat it in a restaurant.

782
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:22,170
I want to do this kind
of work in the future.

783
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:25,190
Is that what you want to do?

784
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:29,550
You've been doing it for
a long time, haven't you?

785
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,970
How long have you been doing it?

786
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:37,210
I've been doing it for 19 months this time.

787
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,850
You're a big veteran.

788
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,690
I don't know anything yet.

789
01:18:41,691 --> 01:18:56,328
I've been doing it for a year and a half or more for about
a year and a half or more, so I'd like to do something

790
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:10,730
like this in the future, but there are still a lot of
things I haven't done yet, so I'd like to do it, but it's

791
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:14,550
I don't know much about it,
so I don't know what to do.

792
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,270
What I haven't done yet is...

793
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,201
If I know what I want to do, I
want to learn how to draw a picture.

794
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:23,590
I want to learn how to draw a picture.

795
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,130
And I want to learn how to draw a map.

796
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,890
So you're going to do it yourself, right?

797
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:29,490
Yes.

798
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,931
You don't have to learn
how to draw a picture.

799
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,510
You've already experienced a lot.

800
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:38,330
Do you have any plans to do
something you want to do in the future?

801
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:41,630
I want to do something.

802
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:42,850
It seems difficult.

803
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,910
But are you interested in it?

804
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,130
I'm interested in it.

805
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:48,430
I want to do various things.

806
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,290
I see.

807
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:55,470
And... I want you to do it.

808
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,870
Do you want me to do it?

809
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,210
Yes, please.

810
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,790
And...

811
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:09,970
It may not be a work at
all, but it's a flight binding.

812
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:13,270
It's amazing.

813
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,290
I want to do that.

814
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,190
Are you interested in that?

815
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:25,170
I saw a person who
made it art on Instagram.

816
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,010
It's art.

817
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:28,011
It's art, isn't it?

818
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:31,090
I thought, wow, it's going to be art.

819
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:34,210
The next day.

820
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,050
Okay.

821
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:38,910
King's room.

822
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,330
It's just a king's room, isn't it?

823
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,150
Oh, you're here.

824
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:56,690
Let's go.

825
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,740
Good evening.

826
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:13,300
Let's have a toast.

827
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,840
Can I have this?

828
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,300
This is champagne.

829
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:20,920
Champagne.

830
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:22,400
Let's open it.

831
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,800
Don't spill it.

832
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,280
Don't spill it.

833
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:28,820
It's okay.

834
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:32,160
I'll open it.

835
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,180
Thank you.

836
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,660
I'll open it.

837
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,720
You didn't peel it.

838
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:42,140
I'll open it.

839
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,720
Don't turn your back.

840
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,780
I won't.

841
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,540
Wow.

842
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,280
Cheers!

843
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,920
Yu-chan, please drink this.

844
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,100
Let's toast.

845
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,631
Yu-chan, please shoot
the toasting temperature.

846
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:15,360
Let's toast to a fun night!

847
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,740
Is alcohol strong?

848
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,420
I don't think so.

849
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,640
You don't think so?

850
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:34,900
I don't think it's strong.

851
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,540
I don't think it's strong.

852
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,000
You don't think it's weak.

853
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:41,671
Do you get a little sexy
when you get drunk?

854
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,300
What do you think?

855
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,120
I don't know.

856
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:45,680
Are you angry?

857
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,220
I don't enjoy it.

858
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:49,820
You don't enjoy it.

859
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:51,980
Yeah.

860
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,600
Wow, you're fast.

861
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,380
You can do it.

862
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:05,540
I have a dream.

863
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,420
A dream?

864
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,600
What is it?

865
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,620
I want a beautiful woman to kiss me.

866
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:17,910
A kiss?

867
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,940
Maybe your dream will come true today.

868
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,800
Really?

869
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,600
No way.

870
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:26,220
No way.

871
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:26,620
I don't think so.

872
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:27,741
I don't know if I can do it.

873
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,180
You can do it.

874
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,640
Can I do it?

875
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,960
Yes, you can.

876
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,980
How can I do it?

877
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,320
What are you doing?

878
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,140
I want you to kiss me.

879
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:40,640
What?

880
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,520
I don't want to spill it.

881
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,280
You can change your clothes.

882
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,820
You can put your head here.

883
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,820
Put your head here.

884
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,300
Can I make my dream come true?

885
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,060
That's good.

886
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:53,320
It's good, isn't it?

887
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,600
It's good, isn't it?

888
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,280
How is it?

889
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,400
Put it in your mouth.

890
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,640
It's quite a lot.

891
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,440
Yes.

892
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:01,620
It's a lot.

893
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,440
Ta-da!

894
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,060
I don't want to waste it.

895
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,680
It's good.

896
01:24:13,485 --> 01:24:15,320
It's the best sake I've ever had.

897
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,880
I'm glad.

898
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,360
Thank you for the second time.

899
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,700
You're welcome.

900
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,840
I'm so happy.

901
01:24:21,841 --> 01:24:23,040
I'm so happy to hear that.

902
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:24,081
I'm so happy to hear that.

903
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,900
What's up?

904
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,180
You look so stylish.

905
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,320
You look so stylish.

906
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,240
Your face is getting red.

907
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Really?

908
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,440
You were embarrassed.

909
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,620
I don't care.

910
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,540
If you go on a date with such a
cute girl, you can die on that day.

911
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,200
What?

912
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,640
I'm going to die.

913
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:52,980
I'll die I'll die I'll die Then, can you
go on a date with me for a while?

914
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,240
A date for a while?

915
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,020
Can you go on a date with me for a while?

916
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,660
Wow, it's connected!

917
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,480
Yay!

918
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,820
Yuu-chan, look at this!

919
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,100
It's so pretty!

920
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,620
Isn't it a great night view?

921
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,320
It's so pretty!

922
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,880
The feet are completely different.

923
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:18,560
I made a reservation for you Oh, really?
Thank you I'll make you happy too I see.

924
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,160
Thank you.

925
01:25:20,161 --> 01:25:21,161
I'm sorry.

926
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,260
Thank you.

927
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:24,996
Do you like this kind of person?

928
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,020
Yes, I do.

929
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:26,940
You're funny.

930
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:28,180
Don't make me say that.

931
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,300
I have two dreams now.

932
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,360
Really?

933
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,720
You said you would die
if your dream came true.

934
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,400
Today is your lucky day.

935
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,980
I'm so happy.

936
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,080
It's my birthday.

937
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,820
Thank you.

938
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,920
I have a dream, too.

939
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:46,921
What is it?

940
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,420
I want to give you a deep kiss.

941
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,720
You're not going to do it?

942
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,380
What?

943
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,540
I don't think I can.

944
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,016
You've done it before, haven't you?

945
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,760
No, I haven't.

946
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:54,956
I've only done it three times.

947
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:55,980
You have!

948
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:57,980
You have!

949
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,080
Me too.

950
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:00,800
Don't be nervous!

951
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,480
Was it the same dream?

952
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,136
Maybe... Let's play
rock-paper-scissors.

953
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,160
Rock-paper-scissors?

954
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,320
Rock-paper-scissors.

955
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,900
Rock-paper-scissors.

956
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:19,220
I'm going to kiss you on the lips.

957
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,920
I'm going to kiss you on the cheeks.

958
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,880
You're going to kiss me
on the bottom of my lips.

959
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,580
Oh, my God.

960
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,520
Are you excited to kiss me?

961
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,780
I'm excited.

962
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,700
Are you excited now?

963
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,820
Yes, I am.

964
01:26:45,821 --> 01:26:46,460
Are you excited?

965
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,440
Yes, I am.

966
01:26:47,441 --> 01:26:48,600
Be excited.

967
01:26:48,601 --> 01:26:51,180
Can you put this on?

968
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:54,160
This?

969
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,700
We'll get excited if you wear that.

970
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,220
Show me how you wear it.

971
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,640
I want to see it.

972
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,320
Where can I buy this?

973
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,900
Where can I buy this?

974
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,700
On the Internet.

975
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,260
You can buy it anywhere.

976
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,120
On the Internet.

977
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,191
What do you think? Are you
excited to be seen with erotic eyes?

978
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:17,880
Yes.

979
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,120
Look at this.

980
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,840
Maybe it's a little wet.

981
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,120
What do you think?

982
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:32,740
I don't think so.

983
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,520
Isn't it too stylish?

984
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:37,380
No, no, no.

985
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,080
Do you usually wear that kind of underwear?

986
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:43,081
There are a lot of them.

987
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:45,820
Yes, there are a lot of them.

988
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,460
It's embarrassing, so don't look down.

989
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,260
From the top.

990
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:54,880
Later.

991
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,220
Oh, later.

992
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:12,460
Which one is which?

993
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:16,580
This way.

994
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,460
This way.

995
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,410
Don't come this way.

996
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,580
Oh my gosh.

997
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,780
It's too narrow.

998
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:31,720
It's hidden well.

999
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,520
It's hidden well.

1000
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:36,760
It's amazing.

1001
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,070
Look.

1002
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,190
What? Is it a defective product?

1003
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:46,930
It's not a defective product.

1004
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,326
You can't see it, it's like this.

1005
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:49,350
Wow, that's amazing.

1006
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:50,890
It's not a defective product.

1007
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:53,910
No, it's like that.

1008
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,010
Oh, it's like that.

1009
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:56,330
You can see it.

1010
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:58,030
Oh, my God.

1011
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:02,030
Don't take it off.

1012
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,970
You're used to it, right?

1013
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,590
Let me wear it.

1014
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:19,210
Don't be mean to me.

1015
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:21,010
Are you going to wear it from above?

1016
01:29:21,011 --> 01:29:22,011
Can you do it?

1017
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,650
No, I can't.

1018
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:24,070
I can see it.

1019
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:25,310
No, you can't.

1020
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,360
Thank you.

1021
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:31,620
Are you ready?

1022
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,080
Yes.

1023
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:36,770
Yuu-chan.

1024
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:37,180
Yes.

1025
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,580
I can't see it.

1026
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,400
I'll do it.

1027
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,530
Wow, it's so high-waisted.

1028
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:52,090
Su-chan, it's the other way around.

1029
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,550
What? The other way around?

1030
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:56,490
Wait a minute.

1031
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:57,010
Wait a minute.

1032
01:29:57,011 --> 01:29:57,050
No way.

1033
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:58,350
No.

1034
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:01,230
It's right there.

1035
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:02,290
Really?

1036
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,230
Wait a minute.

1037
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:08,510
It's too high.

1038
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,310
Are you kidding me?

1039
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:11,110
No, I'm not kidding.

1040
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:12,610
I saw it on the Internet.

1041
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,410
No, I'm not kidding.

1042
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:15,670
Really?

1043
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,790
Wait a minute.

1044
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:19,791
I can't open my eyes.

1045
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,010
I can't open my eyes.

1046
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:24,630
I can't open my eyes.

1047
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:26,030
It's good.

1048
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,470
What's behind you?

1049
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,020
What's that?

1050
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,220
It's cold.

1051
01:30:51,221 --> 01:30:52,300
It's cold.

1052
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:06,770
What is this?

1053
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,110
This is oil.

1054
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:32,740
This is amazing.

1055
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,260
I want to eat this.

1056
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,680
Can I do this, too?

1057
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:51,490
Oh, no! It's transparent!

1058
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:52,850
Wait a minute!

1059
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:54,871
It's a little erotic, isn't it?

1060
01:31:54,975 --> 01:31:55,975
I can't see it.

1061
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:58,530
Look!

1062
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,370
Oh, no!

1063
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,230
I think she's feeling it.

1064
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:16,270
Oh, no! It's transparent!

1065
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:18,930
I can see everything.

1066
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:20,811
Do you want me to go this way?

1067
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,470
No, no, no.

1068
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:24,770
Don't run away.

1069
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:35,450
Wait a minute.

1070
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:36,610
It's too high.

1071
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:42,370
It's too high.

1072
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:45,610
Does it feel good to rub your neck?

1073
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:46,730
Yes, it feels good.

1074
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,270
Really?

1075
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,860
Look at me.

1076
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:07,870
What do you want?

1077
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:09,180
You're drunk.

1078
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:11,580
You can do whatever you want.

1079
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,400
What do you want?

1080
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,780
Everything.

1081
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:16,500
Everything?

1082
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,680
Look at you, Hajime.

1083
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,020
Wait a minute.

1084
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,680
Look at you, Hajime.

1085
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,080
Isn't this too much?

1086
01:33:27,081 --> 01:33:28,081
Isn't it too much?

1087
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:31,540
No, no, no.

1088
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,261
It's more beautiful than the
night view I saw on the Sky Tree.

1089
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:41,580
It's more beautiful than the night view I
saw on the Sky Tree on Christmas Eve.

1090
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:48,900
Hajime, I want to lick you.

1091
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:53,820
I want to lick you.

1092
01:33:53,821 --> 01:33:54,821
What should I do?

1093
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:56,260
I want to lick you.

1094
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,860
I'm going to put you on my lap, okay?

1095
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,020
No, I don't want to.

1096
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,640
Does it feel good?

1097
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:09,910
I'm going to touch you.

1098
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:25,120
Does it feel good?

1099
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:28,240
You're not going to leave, are you?

1100
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,540
I'm going to leave.

1101
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,680
Really?

1102
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,520
It feels good.

1103
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,480
No, no, no.

1104
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:35,481
I'm sorry.

1105
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:40,570
It's okay.

1106
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:45,490
He's been raised.

1107
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:48,210
He's sweet.

1108
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:49,890
He's sweet.

1109
01:34:51,055 --> 01:34:52,110
He's healthy.

1110
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:56,510
Which do you like, inside or outside?

1111
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:59,550
I like both.

1112
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:07,470
He's a boy on the second floor.

1113
01:35:07,471 --> 01:35:08,526
You are in a good condition.

1114
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:09,550
It feels good.

1115
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:19,830
No, no, no, no!

1116
01:35:19,831 --> 01:35:21,670
No, no, no, no!

1117
01:35:21,671 --> 01:35:22,791
You are in a good condition.

1118
01:35:22,995 --> 01:35:23,995
I'm going to die.

1119
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:37,290
You are in a good condition.

1120
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:38,730
Your back is shaking.

1121
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:42,790
Show me your belly.

1122
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,090
Show me your belly.

1123
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,050
Show me your belly.

1124
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,190
Wow, amazing.

1125
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:50,610
Wow, amazing.

1126
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:51,611
It's embarrassing.

1127
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:53,490
I can't see anything.

1128
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:03,430
It feels good.

1129
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:12,470
How about here?

1130
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,640
It feels good.

1131
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,140
No, no, no.

1132
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:39,360
I am glad she is okay now.

1133
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,580
This is so good.

1134
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,760
Do you want to be licked again?

1135
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,560
I want to be licked.

1136
01:37:09,185 --> 01:37:11,980
It's sweet and salty.

1137
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,220
It feels good.

1138
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,380
It feels good.

1139
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,160
How is it?

1140
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,180
It feels so good.

1141
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:46,610
I can't do it.

1142
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:48,730
I'm going to die.

1143
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,620
Wow.

1144
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,000
You are getting better.

1145
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,560
Let's do more.

1146
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,900
Let's do many things.

1147
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,800
Wow.

1148
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:29,700
It's getting harder.

1149
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,000
It feels good.

1150
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:40,620
Ahh!

1151
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,250
Ahh!

1152
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:44,170
Ahh!

1153
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:45,660
Ahh!

1154
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,500
Ahh! It's so nice.

1155
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,130
Ahh!

1156
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,520
Ahh!

1157
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,320
It feels so good.

1158
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,320
Ahh!

1159
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:09,150
Ahh!

1160
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:11,230
It's so nice.

1161
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:13,430
Ahh!

1162
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,880
Ahh!

1163
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,730
It's so good.

1164
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:30,731
It's good, isn't it?

1165
01:39:38,325 --> 01:39:40,020
It's good, isn't it?

1166
01:39:40,021 --> 01:39:41,021
Oh, yeah.

1167
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:48,050
Yeah.

1168
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:50,910
Yeah.

1169
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:54,990
Yeah.

1170
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:56,970
Wow.

1171
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,090
Yeah.

1172
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:59,446
Hey, you should drink this glass.

1173
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,470
Yeah.

1174
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:06,050
Oh... Oh, it feels good.

1175
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:07,450
Yeah.

1176
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:09,230
Yeah.

1177
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:24,980
Yeah.

1178
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:49,080
I'm sorry.

1179
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,420
Oh, it feels so good.

1180
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:22,860
Oh, it feels so good.

1181
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:40,630
Oh, I'm going to throw up.

1182
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:41,930
I'm going to throw up.

1183
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:47,910
I want you to forgive me.

1184
01:41:55,450 --> 01:42:03,250
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1185
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,650
Look at me.

1186
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,310
You are cute.

1187
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:21,570
I was looking at your eyes.

1188
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,740
I'm going to rub your belly.

1189
01:42:40,795 --> 01:42:44,480
I'm going to rub your belly.

1190
01:42:44,481 --> 01:42:44,820
Is it hard?

1191
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,280
It feels good.

1192
01:42:49,415 --> 01:42:51,840
It's warm.

1193
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:54,680
I'm going to rub your belly.

1194
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:00,840
I'm going to rub your belly.

1195
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:05,540
I can't do it anymore.

1196
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:06,541
Give me your hand.

1197
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:43,020
I can't do it anymore.

1198
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:47,860
I can't do it anymore.

1199
01:43:47,861 --> 01:43:58,580
I can't do it anymore.

1200
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:04,800
I want you to put it in your mouth.

1201
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:11,300
Do you really want me
to put it in your mouth?

1202
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,040
It's okay.

1203
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:15,120
It's okay.

1204
01:44:15,121 --> 01:44:16,121
Look at this.

1205
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,580
It's okay.

1206
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:20,860
Look at this.

1207
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,620
It's okay.

1208
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:51,720
I'm going to take a bath.

1209
01:44:55,175 --> 01:44:56,760
You are wet.

1210
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:02,200
I'm going to take a bath.

1211
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:14,320
I'm going to take a bath.

1212
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:48,050
I'm here, mom!

1213
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:18,220
I'm here!

1214
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:18,400
I'm here!

1215
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:19,720
I can't drink it.

1216
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:45,880
It's disgusting.

1217
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:51,160
It hurts.

1218
01:46:51,161 --> 01:46:52,820
Oh, no.

1219
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:54,300
I'm going.

1220
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:16,890
It feels good.

1221
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:30,680
It feels good.

1222
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:33,540
What?

1223
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:36,620
What?

1224
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:41,320
What?

1225
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:42,420
No!

1226
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I'm going!

1227
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:00,260
Stop it.

1228
01:48:00,261 --> 01:48:01,261
Ah! Ah!!

1229
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,960
Your back hurts?

1230
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,560
Yes, my back hurts.

1231
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,780
Ah, it feels warm!

1232
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,440
Whoa, whoa.

1233
01:48:13,441 --> 01:48:15,161
Ah, ah, ah, it feels good, ah, I can do it.

1234
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:17,540
Ah, it feels good.

01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,040
Ah! Ah!

1238
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:41,000
It looks like you're completely all right.

1239
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:42,700
This side.

1240
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:44,860
Open your eyes and look around.

1241
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:47,120
I'm going to put this on you.

1242
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:02,150
It feels so good.

1243

Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu I'm sorry.

1252
01:50:58,770 --> 01:50:59,770
She has a lot of dung.

1253
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:01,370
Look at this.

1254
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:08,090
She has a lot of dung.

1255
01:51:08,091 --> 01:51:09,371
Do you want me to rub your back?

1256
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,250
I'm going to put a bandage on your back.

1257
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:18,430
Does it hurt?

1258
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:33,290
It feels so good.

1259
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:34,470
Oh, wow.

1260
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:42,130
Oh, wow. It feels good.

1261
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:45,730
It feels good.

1262
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:47,590
Does it feel good?

1263
01:51:51,730 --> 01:51:52,730
It's hot.

1264
01:51:53,390 --> 01:51:54,990
It's tickling.

1265
01:51:54,991 --> 01:51:56,271
Do you want me to do it for you?

1266
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:21,220
How do you feel?

1267
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:24,200
It feels good.

1268
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,280
Don't worry about it.

1269
01:52:29,985 --> 01:52:31,140
Show me your sexy back.

1270
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:32,580
Like this?

1271
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:36,100
Show me your sexy back.

1272
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,080
It's not good.

1273
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:40,700
I'm going to sleep.

1274
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:12,580
It's Aty.

1275
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,580
It's okay.

1276
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:33,880
It feels good.

1277
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:36,120
Your waist is moving.

1278
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,720
It's moving.

1279
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:48,440
I'm going to fall.

1280
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:53,920
I'm going to fall.

1281
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,700
You can put it on your head.

1282
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:06,360
It feels so good.

1283
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:07,760
It's so warm.

1284
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,640
No, no, no.

1285
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:25,480
It hurts.

1286
01:54:25,481 --> 01:54:26,481
Eek!

1287
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:30,420
Eek!

1288
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Eek!

1289
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:42,800
I can't do this anymore!

1290
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:51,000
No, I can't.

1291
01:54:51,001 --> 01:54:52,001
Eek!

1292
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:58,920
Let me do it again.

1293
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:00,860
It's scary.

1294
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,180
It's okay.

1295
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,500
I'll do it for now.

1296
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,040
It's hard.

1297
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,520
Like this?

1298
01:55:14,730 --> 01:55:16,110
Like this?

1299
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:18,270
It's scary.

1300
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,490
It hurts.

1301
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:33,670
You are so cute.

1302
01:55:33,671 --> 01:55:34,671
I feel so good.

1303
01:55:35,445 --> 01:55:37,550
You are going to sleep soon.

1304
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:42,030
You are going to sleep soon.

1305
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:49,890
I feel so good.

1306
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:08,720
I feel so good.

1307
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,440
I can't take it anymore.

1308
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:15,300
Oh, no.

1309
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,480
Let's go.

1310
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,640
It feels so good.

1311
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,160
How is your mental state?

1312
01:56:40,161 --> 01:56:41,161
What should I do?

1313
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,400
You want it?

1314
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:45,440
I want you to put it out.

1315
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:46,740
Like this?

1316
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:48,160
Yes, like this.

1317
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,340
Put it out.

1318
01:56:51,420 --> 01:57:00,160
Oh, it's coming out.

1319
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:06,980
Can you see it?

1320
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:09,180
It's warm.

1321
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:11,340
It's warm.

1322
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:21,960
I'm relieved.

1323
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:29,980
I'm relieved.

1324
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,300
I'm here again.

1325
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:38,300
Look at the bottom of your mouth.

1326
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:50,120
I can't do it.

1327
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:53,120
I can't do it.

1328
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,160
I can't do it.

1329
01:57:54,161 --> 01:57:57,360
I can't do it.

1330
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:05,500
I can't do it.

1331
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:07,660
I can't do it.

1332
01:58:07,661 --> 01:58:12,820
I can't do it.

1333
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:57,220
I can't do it.

1334
01:58:58,530 --> 01:59:02,300
It feels good.

1335
01:59:04,775 --> 01:59:11,340
It feels good.

1336
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:16,260
It feels good there.

1337
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:17,760
It's scary.

1338
01:59:17,761 --> 01:59:18,761
I'm going to fall.

1339
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:58,980
I can't stand it anymore.

1340
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:00,820
I'm going to die.

1341
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:02,240
Stay there.

1342
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:19,520
Please be careful not
to hurt your baby's ears.

1343
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:49,000
Please do not force the baby.

1344
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:54,240
You just have to play with the baby.

1345
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:05,740
What?

1346
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:10,180
What?

1347
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:14,220
Do you feel good?

1348
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:15,680
Yes, I feel good.

1349
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,660
Come here.

1350
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:20,760
Come here.

1351
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:27,260
Oh, I feel good.

1352
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,540
Oh, it feels so good!

1353
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,480
Oh, no.

1354
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:38,260
Oh, it feels good.

1355
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,020
Oh, no.

1356
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:46,280
Please let me out.

1357
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Oh, no.

1358
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:06,110
Oh, no.

1359
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:07,550
Oh, no.

1360
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:16,130
You are very close to him.

1361
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:18,390
Oh, no.

1362
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,910
Oh, no.

1363
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:24,410
Oh, no.

1364

02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:27,710
Oh, no.

1366
02:02:30,035 --> 02:02:31,050
He is licking you.

1367
02:02:31,051 --> 02:02:32,051
Don't be so serious.

1368
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,770
Does it feel good?

1369
02:02:56,771 --> 02:02:57,290
Does it feel good?

1370
02:02:57,695 --> 02:02:58,810

02:03:05,290 --> 02:03:12,530
It feels good.

1373
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,980
I'm crying.

1374
02:03:42,981 --> 02:03:49,320
I'm sorry.

1375
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:55,880
You are in pain.

1376
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:02,170
You are in pain.

1377
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:03,370
I know.

1378
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:08,140
I'm sorry.

1379
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:10,550
I'll clean your wound.

1380
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:14,326
Can I put you on the bed again?

1381
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:15,350
Yes.

1382
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:25,670
Ah!

1383
02:04:25,671 --> 02:04:26,671
Ah!

1384
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:28,450

1387
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:35,170
Ah!

1388
02:04:35,171 --> 02:04:36,290
Ah!

1389
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:37,730

It feels so good!

1394
02:05:00,741 --> 02:05:04,920
It feels good, doesn't it?

1395
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:31,190
It feels so good.

1396
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:23,610
I'm sorry.

1397
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:28,690
You're so cute.

1398
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:36,630
You're crying a lot.

1399
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,590
I'm sorry.

1400
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:52,130
Oh, it feels good.

1401

No, no, no.

1404
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:39,860
It's so good that it
makes my heart feel good.

1405
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:45,240
Can you close your eyes?

1406
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,240
You can sleep in a cosy bed.

1407
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:51,620
It's so good.

1408
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:21,040
I touched her and she began to crie.

1409
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:28,140
Your back is benign.

1410
02:08:41,850 --> 02:08:43,270
It's so warm.

1411
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:49,810
Wow, it's so warm.

1412
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:57,230

It feels good.

1414
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:50,280
It feels good.

1415
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:57,440
It feels good!

1416
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:27,680
It feels good!

1417
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:29,820
Here?

1418
02:12:48,850 --> 02:12:51,810
I'm going to give you a big pat on
the back and you're going to let me go.

1419
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:05,360
This side is not hard.

1420
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:07,280
Yeah, it's really hard.

1421
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:13,580
Do you want me to let you go?

1422
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:14,660
Yeah.

1423
02:13:14,661 --> 02:13:16,800
Give me a lot.

1424
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:23,040
Oh, shit.

1425
02:13:27,450 --> 02:13:36,720
Are you okay?

1426
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:45,220

What?

1470

I'm doing something naughty.

1471
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:12,230
What?

1472
02:23:12,570 --> 02:23:13,570

I'm sick of this weird sound.

1480
02:24:25,301 --> 02:24:27,461
In the meantime, I'm getting
more and more sick of it.

1481
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,960
Yui-chan, you're wet.

1482
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:33,020
Why are you so wet?

1483

02:25:07,625 --> 02:25:11,260
It tastes like a monkey.

1489
02:25:40,330 --> 02:25:41,330
It's delicious, isn't it?

1490
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:47,050

02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:02,070
Is it delicious?

1494
02:26:04,180 --> 02:26:05,180
Is it delicious?

1495
02:26:06,155 --> 02:26:07,330

02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:17,070
Oh, it feels so good.

1497
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,730
Oh, it's still in there.

1498
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:23,780
Lick it, lick it.

1499
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:33,470
Can I lick it too?

1500
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:37,410
I licked it yesterday.

1501
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:40,950
Shake it a lot.

1502
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:46,720
Are you hungry?

1503
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,780
I'm fine.

1504
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:50,630
I'm going to feed you a lot.

1505
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:54,790
Help me.

1506
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:01,370
You're so erotic.

1507
02:27:09,390 --> 02:27:11,190
I'm embarrassed.

1508
02:27:11,910 --> 02:27:12,710
Why?

1509
02:27:12,711 --> 02:27:13,970
Let me see your face.

1510
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:15,290
What's wrong with your face?

1511
02:27:19,585 --> 02:27:20,585
Let me clean your neck.

1512
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:22,690
Let me clean your neck.

1513
02:27:30,075 --> 02:27:31,230
It feels good.

1514
02:27:35,470 --> 02:27:37,010
Your neck is stiff.

1515
02:27:38,390 --> 02:27:39,390
Look at me.

1516
02:27:47,310 --> 02:27:48,690
I'm going to put a bandage on your wound.

1517
02:27:48,691 --> 02:27:50,091
Do you want to put a bandage on it?

1518
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:04,350
Does it feel good?

1519
02:28:04,351 --> 02:28:05,351
What?

1520
02:28:37,140 --> 02:28:38,990
Do you want to kiss me?

1521
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:41,330
You don't want to?

1522
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:44,770
Then I'll kiss you.

1523
02:28:46,470 --> 02:28:48,250
You two are romantic, aren't you?

1524
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:52,870
You're so kind, Yuki-chan.

1525
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:14,660
It's getting really hot.

1526
02:29:15,330 --> 02:29:16,410
It feels good.

1527
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:17,610
Does it feel good?

1528
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:30,680
Slippery feet.

1529
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:35,480
I'm sorry.

1530
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,520
I'm sorry.

1531
02:29:37,521 --> 02:29:38,521
I'm embarrassed.

1532
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:40,840
You're wet.

1533
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:53,960
I feel good.

1534
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:57,200
Turn your back.

1535
02:29:58,630 --> 02:30:00,680

Yes, it is.

1542

How do you feel when I touch you like this?

1552
02:31:45,231 --> 02:31:46,870
Does it feel good to be patted?

1553
02:31:47,710 --> 02:31:49,370
It feels good.

1554
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:58,390
I can't do it.

1555

You are slurping.

1659
02:40:49,150 --> 02:40:50,150
You are slurping.

1660
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:55,480
You don't have a good look.

1661
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:56,540
You don't have a good look.

1662
02:40:56,900 --> 02:40:58,200
That's right.

1663
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:20,160
It hurts.

1664
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:24,920
It hurts.

1665
02:41:24,921 --> 02:41:25,921
It's in my neck.

1666
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:27,240
Does it feel good?

1667
02:41:37,480 --> 02:41:39,700
It feels good.

1668
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:54,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1880
02:55:09,690 --> 02:55:11,460
I'm breathing.

1881
02:55:15,460 --> 02:55:20,600
I'm breathing.

1882
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:25,380
It feels good.

1883
02:55:26,330 --> 02:55:27,330
Hold her legs.

1884
02:55:35,210 --> 02:55:38,940
It feels so good.

1885
02:55:42,130 --> 02:55:43,130
What is it?

1886
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:47,000
It feels so good.

1887
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:10,150
It's still hard.

1888
02:56:10,710 --> 02:56:11,890
It's really hard.

1889
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:34,090
Are you okay?

1890
02:56:35,820 --> 02:56:50,300
It feels so good.

1891
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:52,600
It's so good.

1892
02:56:52,620 --> 02:56:52,700
It's so good.

1893
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:53,000
It's so good.

1894
02:56:53,001 --> 02:56:54,001
Mmm.

1895
02:56:54,180 --> 02:56:55,180
Chu.

1896
02:56:58,280 --> 02:56:59,280
Mmm.

1897
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:00,680
Mmm.

1898
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:04,320
Ah.

1899
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:08,100
Mmm.

1900
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:17,160
Mmm.

1901
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:18,860
Ah.

1902
02:57:24,560 --> 02:57:26,500
I'm so happy.

1903
02:57:33,540 --> 02:57:37,380
I feel so good.

1904
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:39,640
I'm getting a lot of pus.

1905
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:42,520
I feel so good.

1906
02:57:47,080 --> 02:57:51,340
Please let me out a lot.

1907
02:57:56,495 --> 02:57:59,720
Please let me out a lot.

1908
02:57:59,721 --> 02:58:02,840
Give me a lot of money, please.

1909
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:05,880
I'll give you a lot of money.

1910
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:11,420
It feels good.

1911
02:58:22,340 --> 02:58:24,780
It's amazing.

1912
02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:27,440
How do you feel?

1913
02:58:35,060 --> 02:58:37,500
Oh, no.

1914
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:39,080
It feels good.

1915
02:58:39,081 --> 02:58:40,081
I'm so happy.

1916
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:59,040
I'll hold you and take you out.

1917
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:01,840
I'll take you out.

1918
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:07,720
I'm going to take you out.

1919
02:59:07,721 --> 02:59:09,800
Look at me.

1920
02:59:13,140 --> 02:59:14,180
I feel good.

1921
02:59:15,100 --> 02:59:17,260
I'm going to take it out.

1922
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:17,880
I'm going to take it out.

1923
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:19,400
I'm going to take it out a lot.

1924
02:59:20,955 --> 02:59:24,860
I'm going to take it out.

1925
02:59:24,861 --> 02:59:27,060
Oh, my God.

1926
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:58,200
I love you.

1927
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:00,670
Can I take a peek?

1928
03:00:01,710 --> 03:00:02,710
Look up.

1929
03:00:12,120 --> 03:00:13,440
Do you want to look at this side?

1930
03:00:16,100 --> 03:00:17,100
You look unpleasant.

1931
03:00:27,670 --> 03:00:29,350
Are you okay? You have a lot on your face.

1932
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:31,880
I'm fine.

1933
03:00:33,130 --> 03:00:34,220
I'm glad you feel good.

1934
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:36,220
You feel good, don't you?

1935
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:38,336
Do you want me to clean your mouth again?

1936
03:00:38,360 --> 03:00:39,360
Yes.

1937
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:40,480
Please be careful.

1938
03:00:57,210 --> 03:00:58,600
It feels good, doesn't it?

1939
03:01:05,830 --> 03:01:08,480
Did you feel good?

1940
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:11,700
Yes, I did.

1941
03:01:12,150 --> 03:01:13,700
I'm so sleepy.

1942
03:01:24,860 --> 03:01:27,500
I'm sleepy.

1943
03:02:01,280 --> 03:02:02,280
You should take a break.

1944
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:25,820
Good morning.

1945
03:02:29,050 --> 03:02:30,440
I'm in the hotel now.

1946
03:02:31,710 --> 03:02:33,560
Everyone is here.

1947
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:36,260
Good morning.

1948
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:37,960
Good morning.

1949
03:02:40,150 --> 03:02:47,360
Today, I'm going to do this Pico
Pico Hammer while I'm in bed.

1950
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:56,640
I'm going to do rock-paper-scissors.

1951
03:02:58,580 --> 03:02:59,580
Are you sure?

1952
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:00,840
I'm serious.

1953
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:03,220
Have you ever done this before?

1954
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:04,460
No, I haven't.

1955
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:06,620
I've seen it before.

1956
03:03:06,621 --> 03:03:07,621
Do you know how to do it?

1957
03:03:07,780 --> 03:03:08,780
I know how to do it.

1958
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:09,120
I see.

1959
03:03:09,740 --> 03:03:11,160
If I win, I'll hit you.

1960
03:03:11,780 --> 03:03:14,140
If I lose, I'll cover you with a net.

1961
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:15,380
I'll protect you.

1962
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:15,840
I see.

1963
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:17,700
Can I win with rock-paper-scissors?

1964
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:19,920
Yes, you can.

1965
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:21,000
You can win with a net.

1966
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:22,600
I see.

1967
03:03:22,820 --> 03:03:24,140
I should have done it with a net.

1968
03:03:24,360 --> 03:03:25,360
I see.

1969
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:28,540
Nice to meet you.

1970
03:03:31,280 --> 03:03:33,300
Is rock-paper-scissors strong?

1971
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:35,700
Rock-paper-scissors is very strong.

1972
03:03:35,701 --> 03:03:37,100
Oh, really?

1973
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:39,640
Are you ready?

1974
03:03:39,860 --> 03:03:40,860
Yes, I'm ready.

1975
03:03:41,700 --> 03:03:44,020
If you lose, you have to do this.

1976
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:44,980
If you win, you have to do this.

1977
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:46,120
Let's get started.

1978
03:03:47,420 --> 03:03:48,660
Rock, paper, scissors!

1979
03:03:48,661 --> 03:03:49,880
Oh, no!

1980
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:52,160
You're acting like an adult.

1981
03:03:52,940 --> 03:03:53,960
No, I'm not an adult.

1982
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:56,120
You're not an adult.

1983
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:59,860
Wasn't there a key?

1984
03:04:00,880 --> 03:04:03,700
Rock, paper, scissors!

1985
03:04:03,701 --> 03:04:07,780
Let's do it seriously this time.

1986
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:09,760
I can't do it.

1987
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:12,680
It's not fair to be an adult.

1988
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:15,020
You can shout.

1989
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:16,500
OK.

1990
03:04:18,070 --> 03:04:20,260
Rock-paper-scissors!

1991
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:23,520
Rock-paper-scissors!

1992
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:25,280
Rock-paper-scissors!

1993
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:30,360
That was dangerous.

1994
03:04:30,361 --> 03:04:32,060
It was the other way around.

1995
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:33,240
I'm sorry.

1996
03:04:33,400 --> 03:04:34,400
I'll protect you.

1997
03:04:46,900 --> 03:04:50,960
You are weak.

1998
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:56,120
You were so energetic.

1999
03:05:03,560 --> 03:05:04,600
So fast!

2000
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:06,400
This is hard.

2001
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:12,340
Rock-paper-scissors!

2002
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:15,240
Out!

2003
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:18,380
So fast!

2004
03:05:20,540 --> 03:05:21,540
What should I do?

2005
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:23,260
One win?

2006
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:25,500
You do this after the game is over, right?

2007
03:05:25,960 --> 03:05:27,080
Yes, after the game is over.

2008
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:27,980
Please!

2009
03:05:27,981 --> 03:05:30,220
I'll win this time.

2010
03:05:30,580 --> 03:05:32,460
I won once.

2011
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:35,140
We are connected.

2012
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:36,140
We are connected.

2013
03:05:36,620 --> 03:05:38,060
Thank you.

2014
03:05:39,900 --> 03:05:40,960
1,2,3

2015
03:05:40,961 --> 03:05:42,740
Rock-paper-scissors!

2016
03:05:43,380 --> 03:05:44,380
Wait!

2017
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:47,920
1,2,3

2018
03:05:47,921 --> 03:05:48,921
Rock-paper-scissors!

2019
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:55,020
I lost.

2020
03:05:57,980 --> 03:05:59,580
I lost.

2021
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:02,460
I lost.

2022
03:06:02,461 --> 03:06:02,580
I lost.

2023
03:06:03,400 --> 03:06:06,560
Let's do the punishment game.

2024
03:06:06,700 --> 03:06:07,700
What is this?

2025
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:11,380
I recorded it.

2026
03:06:12,500 --> 03:06:14,140
Yu-chan said it.

2027
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:16,660
I'm lonely.

2028
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:18,300
I'm lonely.

2029
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:20,540
There are people who lost.

2030
03:06:23,930 --> 03:06:25,360
Does it hurt?

2031
03:06:25,361 --> 03:06:26,361
It hurts.

2032
03:06:27,170 --> 03:06:30,500
I'll do it.

2033
03:06:33,160 --> 03:06:34,180
It hurts!

2034
03:06:35,250 --> 03:06:36,250
It hurts, doesn't it?

2035
03:06:36,300 --> 03:06:37,020
It hurts!

2036
03:06:37,260 --> 03:06:38,260
It's so numb.

2037
03:06:38,985 --> 03:06:40,320
It's tingling.

2038
03:06:40,820 --> 03:06:41,820
It's tingling, isn't it?

2039
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:43,000
It's dangerous.

2040
03:06:43,160 --> 03:06:44,160
It's dangerous, isn't it?

2041
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:47,000
You got angry, didn't you?

2042
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:49,400
No, I didn't.

2043
03:06:50,060 --> 03:06:51,560
I had a lot of fun.

2044
03:06:51,561 --> 03:06:54,120
I haven't cut my hair yet.

2045
03:06:54,270 --> 03:06:54,920
I haven't cut my hair yet.

2046
03:06:54,921 --> 03:06:56,520
I haven't cut my hair yet.

2047
03:06:57,360 --> 03:06:58,560
I wanted you to fix your hair.

2048
03:07:01,170 --> 03:07:03,880
We have a gift for you.

2049
03:07:04,120 --> 03:07:05,120
A gift?

2050
03:07:05,260 --> 03:07:06,260
A gift?

2051
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:09,000
We have a gift for you.

2052
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:10,240
Oh, yeah.

2053
03:07:11,060 --> 03:07:12,900
What did you say?

2054
03:07:14,600 --> 03:07:16,220
China or maid?

2055
03:07:17,400 --> 03:07:18,060
You want to wear one of them.

2056
03:07:18,061 --> 03:07:18,400
You want to wear it, right?

2057
03:07:18,760 --> 03:07:19,760
I want to wear it.

2058
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:21,860
Do you have one?

2059
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:24,000
I have one in the bathroom.

2060
03:07:25,180 --> 03:07:26,180
I see.

2061
03:07:26,980 --> 03:07:28,300
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

2062
03:07:28,860 --> 03:07:29,860
Which one?

2063
03:07:33,100 --> 03:07:34,100
Do you have one?

2064
03:07:34,600 --> 03:07:36,280
I want you to change your clothes.

2065
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:38,560
I see.

2066
03:07:40,300 --> 03:07:41,300
I'm going.

2067
03:07:41,620 --> 03:07:42,720
We're waiting for you.

2068
03:07:43,380 --> 03:07:44,380
I'm going back.

2069
03:07:44,610 --> 03:07:46,356
I'm looking forward to it,
so please leave it there.

2070
03:07:46,380 --> 03:07:47,380
Oh, is that okay?

2071
03:07:48,100 --> 03:07:49,100
I'll go.

2072
03:07:51,070 --> 03:10:37,520
Oh, it's done.

2073
03:10:37,880 --> 03:10:38,880
It's done.

2074
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,260
Wow, it's really close.

2075
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:43,700
How is it?

2076
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:46,220
Wow, it looks great on you.

2077
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,000
Really?

2078
03:10:48,360 --> 03:10:49,360
How about the back?

2079
03:10:51,170 --> 03:10:52,260
I want you to say,

2080
03:10:52,410 --> 03:10:54,210
What do you think of
the scene where you say,

2081
03:10:55,860 --> 03:10:56,860
There are four of us.

2082
03:10:58,270 --> 03:10:59,856
You wanted to come to the park, didn't you?

2083
03:10:59,880 --> 03:11:00,880
Yes.

2084
03:11:01,820 --> 03:11:03,220
The number of people is increasing.

2085
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:04,600
Is it increasing?

2086
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:06,860
Kinosene?

2087
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:08,560
It's Kinosene.

2088
03:11:10,020 --> 03:11:11,020
I made a mistake.

2089
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:13,740
It's the fastest.

2090
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:15,600
It's the fastest.

2091
03:11:16,720 --> 03:11:17,720
It's the fastest.

2092
03:11:17,800 --> 03:11:18,660
It's too fast.

2093
03:11:18,661 --> 03:11:20,360
It really looks good on you.

2094
03:11:30,650 --> 03:11:34,180
You don't have a husband, do you?

2095
03:11:34,720 --> 03:11:35,720
No.

2096
03:11:35,830 --> 03:11:36,910
But you have four children.

2097
03:11:37,740 --> 03:11:38,740
I have a lot.

2098
03:11:56,970 --> 03:11:58,780
The cat's mood has changed.

2099
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:01,000
The cat's mood has changed.

2100
03:12:01,980 --> 03:12:05,420
The cat is a sexy maid.

2101
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,860
I'm going to give you a kiss.

2102
03:12:38,820 --> 03:12:40,380
Please lick my boobs.

2103
03:12:50,560 --> 03:12:53,280
It feels good.

2104
03:12:55,700 --> 03:12:56,700
Oh.

2105
03:12:59,140 --> 03:13:02,980
Oh, I feel good.

2106
03:13:11,560 --> 03:13:14,040
I feel good.

2107
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:19,900
I will do whatever you say.

2108
03:13:27,260 --> 03:13:28,940
It's okay, it's okay, reach out your hand.

2109
03:13:30,190 --> 03:13:31,190
It's effective, isn't it?

2110
03:13:33,950 --> 03:13:35,700
What is that?

2111
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:41,320
It looks good on you.

2112
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:51,760
It doesn't move.

2113
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:53,560
Raise your hand.

2114
03:13:53,561 --> 03:13:56,020
You can use your hands now.

2115
03:13:56,740 --> 03:13:57,740
You're so beautiful.

2116
03:13:59,120 --> 03:14:00,120
You're so beautiful.

2117
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:02,840
You're so beautiful.

2118
03:14:03,100 --> 03:14:04,100
You're smiling.

2119
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:06,340
You're smiling.

2120
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:11,360
You shouldn't smile.

2121
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:13,720
You shouldn't smile.

2122
03:14:14,260 --> 03:14:17,120
Look at this.

2123
03:14:17,270 --> 03:14:18,280
I'm going to feed you.

2124
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:31,660
It feels good.

2125
03:14:33,040 --> 03:14:36,180
It feels good, doesn't it?

2126
03:14:36,181 --> 03:14:36,260
It feels good.

2127
03:14:36,360 --> 03:14:37,360
Don't laugh.

2128
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:40,700
Don't laugh.

2129
03:14:49,250 --> 03:14:50,250
Don't worry, don't worry.

2130
03:14:50,680 --> 03:14:52,150
Open your eyes and look at me.

2131
03:14:52,840 --> 03:14:53,990
Look at me.

2132
03:14:57,130 --> 03:15:05,710
Show me your butt.

2133
03:15:13,700 --> 03:15:15,090
That's a good butt.

2134
03:15:20,360 --> 03:15:23,150
What's wrong with you?

2135
03:15:23,151 --> 03:15:24,151
What's wrong with you?

2136
03:15:26,650 --> 03:15:28,290
It's difficult.

2137
03:15:28,720 --> 03:15:29,960
You shouldn't say such a thing.

2138
03:15:32,610 --> 03:15:34,290
I'm sorry.

2139
03:15:35,710 --> 03:15:36,850
I'm sorry.

2140
03:15:36,851 --> 03:15:37,851
I'll punish you.

2141
03:15:39,780 --> 03:15:41,470
I'm sorry.

2142
03:15:45,090 --> 03:15:46,090
Hey!

2143
03:15:47,220 --> 03:15:49,090
Please pat my butt more.

2144
03:15:49,670 --> 03:15:52,150
Please pat my butt more.

2145
03:15:52,690 --> 03:15:53,690
Hey!

2146
03:15:53,930 --> 03:15:54,930
Hey!

2147
03:15:57,030 --> 03:15:58,990
I will bully you with this.

2148
03:16:09,360 --> 03:16:12,360
It feels good.

2149
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:16,820
What is it?

2150
03:16:16,821 --> 03:16:17,020
She's so excited.

2151
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:18,840
She's so excited.

2152
03:16:23,060 --> 03:16:27,340
No, no, no.

2153
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:28,320
She's going to go.

2154
03:16:28,340 --> 03:16:29,340
She's going to go.

2155
03:16:29,660 --> 03:16:30,660
Hang in there.

2156
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:34,280
No, no.

2157
03:16:35,600 --> 03:16:37,300
She can't protect her husband.

2158
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:39,060
It feels good.

2159
03:16:43,360 --> 03:16:44,360
She's going to go.

2160
03:16:46,820 --> 03:16:47,820
I'm going to cry.

2161
03:16:50,740 --> 03:16:53,240
No, no, no.

2162
03:16:53,960 --> 03:16:54,960
I'm going.

2163
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:04,140
She's gone.

2164
03:17:04,680 --> 03:17:05,740
She's not saying, go, go.

2165
03:17:07,340 --> 03:17:09,880
This is a more embarrassing school.

2166
03:17:10,900 --> 03:17:12,660
I'm going to give you a little more.

2167
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:14,196
I'll make you feel embarrassed.

2168
03:17:14,220 --> 03:17:15,420
I'll make you smile more.

2169
03:17:15,421 --> 03:17:16,440
I can't do it anymore!

2170
03:17:18,170 --> 03:17:19,340
Ah, it feels so good!

2171
03:17:22,100 --> 03:17:23,100
I can't do it anymore!

2172
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:26,260
Ah, this feels good!

2173
03:17:29,160 --> 03:17:30,320
I can't do it anymore!

2174
03:17:31,480 --> 03:17:32,540
I'm going to die!

2175
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:34,800
I'm going!

2176
03:17:35,120 --> 03:17:36,120
I'm going!

2177
03:17:37,460 --> 03:17:38,460
I'm going!

2178
03:17:48,330 --> 03:17:49,350
Don't stop.

2179
03:17:49,990 --> 03:17:51,810
I can't.

2180
03:17:54,390 --> 03:17:55,430
I can't.

2181
03:17:59,800 --> 03:18:00,800
I can't.

2182
03:18:06,600 --> 03:18:07,600
I can't.

2183
03:18:08,680 --> 03:18:10,700
You haven't opened it yet.

2184
03:18:11,460 --> 03:18:12,460
Open it.

2185
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:14,120
Oh!

2186
03:18:17,620 --> 03:18:20,400
It's so wet.

2187
03:18:21,780 --> 03:18:23,580
I can't.

2188
03:18:23,581 --> 03:18:25,640
You are a very sexy maid.

2189
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:27,840
You are very wet.

2190
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:29,440
I don't like it.

2191
03:18:29,800 --> 03:18:31,520
Do you want me to take it off?

2192
03:18:32,140 --> 03:18:32,840
You want me to take it off, right?

2193
03:18:32,860 --> 03:18:33,860
How do you feel?

2194
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:37,000
I don't like it.

2195
03:18:42,440 --> 03:18:42,960
Take it off.

2196
03:18:43,160 --> 03:18:43,620
I don't like it.

2197
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:44,600
I don't like it.

2198
03:18:44,601 --> 03:18:45,440
Take it off.

2199
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:46,620
I don't like it.

2200
03:18:50,440 --> 03:18:51,760
I don't like it.

2201
03:18:51,761 --> 03:18:53,440
Where are you touching right now?

2202
03:18:56,560 --> 03:18:58,640
It feels so good.

2203
03:19:09,240 --> 03:19:11,760
You are doing the best you can.

2204
03:19:17,320 --> 03:19:18,240
Not yet!

2205
03:19:18,241 --> 03:19:19,241
No, not yet!

2206
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:29,760
You are such a naughty girl.

2207
03:19:31,360 --> 03:19:32,520
I have to give you a massage.

2208
03:19:37,600 --> 03:19:38,720
What do you like?

2209
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:42,140
It feels good.

2210
03:19:42,620 --> 03:19:43,620
Oh, it's painful.

2211
03:19:44,780 --> 03:19:45,780
It hurts.

2212
03:19:53,180 --> 03:19:55,200
It's painful.

2213
03:20:01,350 --> 03:20:02,350
I can't.

2214
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:06,860
I'm going!

2215
03:20:21,090 --> 03:20:24,550
Who told you go like that?

2216
03:20:25,190 --> 03:20:26,190
I'm sorry.

2217
03:20:26,850 --> 03:20:27,850
Chikubi, come on.

2218
03:20:28,730 --> 03:20:29,730
Chikubi, come on.

2219
03:20:30,550 --> 03:20:31,470
Oh, it feels good.

2220
03:20:31,570 --> 03:20:32,770
Chikubi is happy to be petted.

2221
03:20:34,130 --> 03:20:35,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

2222
03:20:36,690 --> 03:20:37,690
Oh, it's hot.

2223
03:21:02,430 --> 03:21:04,551
Awwww Look, look,
he is trying to lick you.

2224
03:21:05,090 --> 03:21:06,350
Awwww, feels good!

2225
03:21:07,030 --> 03:21:08,970
Awwww.

2226
03:21:10,330 --> 03:21:12,000
Awwww No!

2227
03:21:13,030 --> 03:21:14,430
Awwww, feels good!

2228
03:21:16,290 --> 03:21:18,770
Awwww Awwww Awwww.

2229
03:21:20,290 --> 03:21:21,470
No! No!

2230
03:21:22,050 --> 03:21:23,310
No! He is going!

2231
03:21:23,311 --> 03:21:25,130
Let's go.

2232
03:21:25,810 --> 03:21:26,810
Let's go.

2233
03:21:31,250 --> 03:21:32,510
Who said you want to go?

2234
03:21:33,170 --> 03:21:34,410
I'm sorry.

2235
03:21:34,930 --> 03:21:35,930
Let's go.

2236
03:21:35,960 --> 03:21:37,990
Let's eat dirty food.

2237
03:21:41,350 --> 03:21:43,310
Let's go.

2238
03:21:45,390 --> 03:21:45,750
Let's go.

2239
03:21:45,870 --> 03:21:46,050
Let's go.

2240
03:21:46,051 --> 03:21:47,051
Let's go.

2241
03:21:47,450 --> 03:21:51,310
Let's go.

2242
03:21:53,390 --> 03:21:54,390
I'm sorry.

2243
03:21:57,650 --> 03:21:58,650
She licked it.

2244
03:22:01,710 --> 03:22:03,110
You should clean up the dirty part.

2245
03:22:04,590 --> 03:22:05,590
What does it taste like?

2246
03:22:08,070 --> 03:22:09,070
It tastes like a poop.

2247
03:22:09,190 --> 03:22:09,450
What?

2248
03:22:10,130 --> 03:22:10,470
Poop?

2249
03:22:10,930 --> 03:22:11,930
Yes.

2250
03:22:14,925 --> 03:22:15,925
Oh, my.

2251
03:22:16,270 --> 03:22:17,270
Oh, my.

2252
03:22:17,430 --> 03:22:18,610
Oh, my.

2253
03:22:19,390 --> 03:22:20,190
Oh, my.

2254
03:22:20,191 --> 03:22:20,990
Oh, my.

2255
03:22:20,991 --> 03:22:21,370
Oh, my.

2256
03:22:21,450 --> 03:22:21,930
Oh, my.

2257
03:22:22,050 --> 03:22:22,210
Oh, my.

2258
03:22:22,211 --> 03:22:22,630
Oh, my.

2259
03:22:22,830 --> 03:22:22,930
Oh, my.

2260
03:22:22,931 --> 03:22:23,931
You are so cute.

2261
03:22:30,730 --> 03:22:32,750
I'm going to clean your
buttocks and buttocks.

2262
03:22:35,790 --> 03:22:37,010
You are grumbling.

2263
03:22:39,670 --> 03:22:41,670
I'm going to clean your
buttocks and buttocks.

2264
03:22:41,720 --> 03:22:43,350
I'm scared.

2265
03:22:43,590 --> 03:22:44,590
Come on.

2266
03:22:45,670 --> 03:22:47,010
Come on.

2267
03:22:47,011 --> 03:22:48,170
Come on.

2268
03:22:50,150 --> 03:22:50,430
You're going to be okay.

2269
03:22:50,810 --> 03:22:53,630
I'm scared.

2270
03:22:54,630 --> 03:22:56,110
Come on.

2271
03:22:56,410 --> 03:22:59,150
Come on.

2272
03:23:00,250 --> 03:23:05,970
It hurts.

2273
03:23:13,230 --> 03:23:14,570
Come on.

2274
03:23:15,930 --> 03:23:18,130
You can't do that.

2275
03:23:19,170 --> 03:23:19,930
You can't do that.

2276
03:23:19,931 --> 03:23:21,051
You still have a little bit.

2277
03:23:24,030 --> 03:23:25,030
Do you want to lick?

2278
03:23:25,290 --> 03:23:26,770
Yes, I want to lick.

2279
03:23:27,010 --> 03:23:28,410
Let me lick you.

2280
03:23:29,210 --> 03:23:30,570
Let me lick you.

2281
03:23:38,525 --> 03:23:41,410
You have to lick yourself.

2282
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:52,820
It's not just one baby.

2283
03:23:53,750 --> 03:23:56,420
There are so many of them.

2284
03:24:03,965 --> 03:24:06,790
Look at me and lick me.

2285
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:14,410
Look at me.

2286
03:24:14,510 --> 03:24:15,730
Look at me.

2287
03:24:24,350 --> 03:24:26,310
You are a good boy.

2288
03:24:33,570 --> 03:24:34,710
You are a good boy.

2289
03:24:35,610 --> 03:24:36,610
You are a good boy.

2290
03:24:49,130 --> 03:24:50,130
I'm sorry.

2291
03:24:50,170 --> 03:24:50,850
I'm sorry.

2292
03:24:50,851 --> 03:24:51,851
You can't eat half of it.

2293
03:24:52,010 --> 03:24:53,010
You can't eat half of it.

2294
03:25:02,550 --> 03:25:04,050
You can eat the other half.

2295
03:25:31,230 --> 03:25:32,430
He seems to be in a good mood.

2296
03:25:47,770 --> 03:25:50,170
Look at this.

2297
03:25:50,171 --> 03:25:51,171
Look at this.

2298
03:25:51,270 --> 03:25:52,270
Look at this.

2299
03:25:53,350 --> 03:25:58,250
I think it's enough.

2300
03:25:58,251 --> 03:25:58,670
What are you eating?

2301
03:25:58,970 --> 03:26:07,830
It's hot.

2302
03:26:07,831 --> 03:26:13,970
It's hot.

2303
03:26:13,971 --> 03:26:15,110
No, no, no.

2304
03:26:15,630 --> 03:26:16,630
Oh, Himawari.

2305
03:26:16,730 --> 03:26:17,730
No!

2306
03:26:17,910 --> 03:26:20,610
No no no!

2307
03:26:23,590 --> 03:26:28,230
Oh, you need to pat him on the back.

2308
03:26:28,430 --> 03:26:30,110
He is pushing out his ass.

2309
03:26:30,430 --> 03:26:32,150
Look, he is putting his hands on your back.

2310
03:26:33,290 --> 03:26:34,030
Look, he is putting his hands on your back.

2311
03:26:34,031 --> 03:26:34,290
Be careful.

2312
03:26:34,650 --> 03:26:35,650
Be careful.

2313
03:26:37,470 --> 03:26:38,910
He is trying to suck you.

2314
03:26:43,970 --> 03:26:46,000
You have a scar on your face.

2315
03:26:58,160 --> 03:26:59,820
Now, it's your turn.

2316
03:27:05,280 --> 03:27:12,040
It feels so good.

2317
03:27:12,820 --> 03:27:14,220
You wet your face.

2318
03:27:21,600 --> 03:27:23,280
It feels so good.

2319
03:27:23,281 --> 03:27:24,281
This way?

2320
03:27:25,280 --> 03:27:29,500
No, no, no, no.

2321
03:27:29,560 --> 03:27:29,640
No, no, no, no.

2322
03:27:29,870 --> 03:27:30,980
No, no, no.

2323
03:27:30,981 --> 03:27:33,700
Ok, I will do it.

2324
03:27:35,340 --> 03:27:38,840
No, no.

2325
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:40,020
I'm going.

2326
03:27:40,080 --> 03:27:41,080
I'm going.

2327
03:27:41,860 --> 03:27:43,060
No, no.

2328
03:27:43,061 --> 03:27:44,061
Ok, this way.

2329
03:27:44,800 --> 03:27:46,360
Turn around.

2330
03:27:48,460 --> 03:27:49,620
Turn around.

2331
03:27:51,480 --> 03:27:53,220
Turn around.

2332
03:27:53,221 --> 03:27:54,541
You're not going to cry, are you?

2333
03:28:01,040 --> 03:28:04,160
You're not going to cry, are you?

2334
03:28:09,550 --> 03:28:14,020
You're not going to cry, are you?

2335
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:32,840
Licking his arms.

2336
03:28:34,800 --> 03:28:37,880
Would you please lick a lot, Yo-ran.

2337
03:28:57,115 --> 03:28:59,500
Look at this side.

2338
03:29:00,040 --> 03:29:01,880
Look at this side.

2339
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:04,520
Open your eyes.

2340
03:29:15,140 --> 03:29:16,920
Please punish me.

2341
03:29:18,540 --> 03:29:20,600
Please punish me.

2342
03:29:23,180 --> 03:29:26,920
Please punish me.

2343
03:29:38,420 --> 03:29:40,660
I'm going to put a lot
of candy in your hat.

2344
03:29:46,850 --> 03:29:48,500
What are you going to do with this candy?

2345
03:29:50,340 --> 03:29:53,120
Please put a lot of candy in my hat.

2346
03:29:53,540 --> 03:29:53,920
Do you like candy?

2347
03:29:54,260 --> 03:29:55,260
Yes.

2348
03:29:56,700 --> 03:29:57,700
Do you like candy?

2349
03:29:58,140 --> 03:29:59,140
Yes.

2350
03:29:59,660 --> 03:30:00,620
It's warm.

2351
03:30:00,621 --> 03:30:02,400
It's warm.

2352
03:30:06,060 --> 03:30:07,060
Let's go to the master.

2353
03:30:08,160 --> 03:30:11,100
It feels good.

2354
03:30:12,580 --> 03:30:13,940
Make a louder voice.

2355
03:30:14,240 --> 03:30:16,140
It feels good.

2356
03:30:24,050 --> 03:30:25,050
I'm going.

2357
03:30:25,150 --> 03:30:26,550
You can't go yet.

2358
03:30:26,551 --> 03:30:27,551
You can do it.

2359
03:30:31,490 --> 03:30:33,910
I'm sorry.

2360
03:30:38,510 --> 03:30:39,510
I can't do it.

2361
03:30:39,610 --> 03:30:40,610
I can do it.

2362
03:30:42,710 --> 03:30:45,010
You can do it.

2363
03:30:46,610 --> 03:30:52,850
You can do it.

2364
03:30:52,851 --> 03:30:54,270
Let's do the other side.

2365
03:30:56,710 --> 03:30:58,010
Let's do the other side.

2366
03:30:58,011 --> 03:30:59,011
It feels so good.

2367
03:30:59,410 --> 03:31:01,290
Open your legs a little bit.

2368
03:31:04,295 --> 03:31:06,850
It's so good.

2369
03:31:07,550 --> 03:31:09,490
It feels so good.

2370
03:31:11,270 --> 03:31:14,330
It feels so good.

2371
03:31:15,570 --> 03:31:20,850
It's so good.

2372
03:31:25,370 --> 03:31:26,370
Good boy!

2373
03:31:32,400 --> 03:31:33,400
Ouch!

2374
03:31:39,920 --> 03:31:44,760
I'll tell the people around
you that you're in the room.

2375
03:31:47,420 --> 03:31:49,040
I'm in the room.

2376
03:31:49,900 --> 03:31:51,180
It's warm.

2377
03:31:54,940 --> 03:31:56,720
That is the best!

2378
03:31:57,520 --> 03:31:59,100
Ahh... feels so good!

2379
03:31:59,520 --> 03:31:59,620
Feels good?

2380
03:31:59,621 --> 03:32:00,621
Nice!

2381
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:28,100
It feels so good!

2382
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:47,860
I'll make you feel better!

2383
03:33:00,940 --> 03:33:12,363
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2385
03:33:43,310 --> 03:33:45,230

Hang in there.

2418
03:37:18,160 --> 03:37:19,700

Ahhhh.

2550
03:55:01,200 --> 03:55:04,500
It feels good, right?

2551
03:55:05,630 --> 03:55:06,700
Oh!

2552
03:55:06,750 --> 03:55:11,261
It's hot Yeah, it's hot Oh!

2553
03:55:11,420 --> 03:55:12,420
Oh!

2554
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:13,740
Oh!

2555
03:55:30,620 --> 03:55:31,740
Oh!

2556
03:55:33,780 --> 03:55:34,340
Oh!

2557
03:55:34,341 --> 03:55:34,580
Oh!

2558
03:55:34,581 --> 03:55:35,440
Oh!

2559
03:55:35,441 --> 03:55:36,441
What should I do?

2560
03:56:16,580 --> 03:56:17,100
Now you're going to hug me like that.

2561
03:56:17,101 --> 03:56:17,560
I'm going to hug you.

2562
03:56:17,561 --> 03:56:19,200
It feels good.

2563
03:56:32,920 --> 03:56:38,420
Hey, what are you doing?

2564
03:56:38,421 --> 03:56:41,000
Please give me a lot of money.

2565
03:56:43,800 --> 03:56:45,700
Are you ready?

2566
03:56:48,520 --> 03:56:52,500
Please give me a lot of money.

2567
03:56:53,460 --> 03:56:54,460
Ouch!

2568
03:56:56,060 --> 03:57:01,360
It's hot.

2569
03:57:10,660 --> 03:57:12,800
I'm so tired.

2570
03:57:44,260 --> 03:57:47,140
Give me a kiss.

2571
03:58:20,440 --> 03:58:21,440
I'm Yuu.

2572
03:58:21,650 --> 03:58:22,620
Yuu channel.

2573
03:58:22,621 --> 03:58:23,621
I can see you!

2574
03:58:24,100 --> 03:58:25,100
Yeah!

2575
03:58:26,480 --> 03:58:27,900
Hello.

2576
03:58:29,520 --> 03:58:30,520
I'm Ruka Ayu.

2577
03:58:34,160 --> 03:58:35,160
Today,

2578
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:38,100
I'm going to try an
interesting project.

2579
03:58:40,600 --> 03:58:41,600
I'm going to try it.

2580
03:58:44,300 --> 03:58:48,040
What are you into these days?

2581
03:58:48,041 --> 03:58:49,161
Do you have a favorite food?

2582
03:58:50,600 --> 03:58:54,920
I'm into Sushi right now.

2583
03:58:56,010 --> 03:59:00,240
I ate it yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

2584
03:59:01,620 --> 03:59:11,960
My favorite food is Japanese
sea bream, Negitoro, and Torotaku.

2585
03:59:15,320 --> 03:59:26,360
Today's video is a video using this.

2586
03:59:27,840 --> 03:59:29,700
Do you know what this is?

2587
03:59:31,380 --> 03:59:34,740
It's a wrap.

2588
03:59:36,780 --> 03:59:41,731
Today, I'm going to wrap
this wrap around my body

2589
03:59:41,743 --> 03:59:46,300
and see how much I
can get rid of my nipples.

2590
03:59:50,500 --> 03:59:55,220
I'm going to start wrapping
the wrap around my body.

2591
03:59:55,221 --> 03:59:56,221
I'm going to take it off.

2592
04:00:08,690 --> 04:00:10,960
I'm going to take it off.

2593
04:00:26,200 --> 04:00:27,430
How is it, pink?

2594
04:00:28,150 --> 04:00:29,170
Isn't it fresh?

2595
04:00:42,420 --> 04:00:44,940
I'm going to take it off.

2596
04:00:58,440 --> 04:00:59,560
I took it off.

2597
04:00:59,561 --> 04:01:00,561
It's done.

2598
04:01:01,560 --> 04:01:04,100
I'm going to roll it.

2599
04:01:22,610 --> 04:01:23,610
Oh, no. It's stuck.

2600
04:01:25,060 --> 04:01:26,060
OK.

2601
04:01:34,840 --> 04:01:38,780
How long do you think I can roll it?

2602
04:01:46,400 --> 04:01:48,220
This is the third round.

2603
04:01:48,221 --> 04:01:49,221
I'm sorry.

2604
04:01:59,760 --> 04:02:01,320
I feel like I'm being ignored.

2605
04:02:10,300 --> 04:02:12,260
I forgot how many laps I did.

2606
04:02:17,520 --> 04:02:18,860
I'm counting.

2607
04:02:23,680 --> 04:02:25,840
I've been hiding a lot.

2608
04:02:27,330 --> 04:02:28,800
How is it?

2609
04:02:33,950 --> 04:02:36,380
Can you see it? It's hidden, isn't it?

2610
04:02:39,900 --> 04:02:45,440
Then, I'm going to peel it off from here.

2611
04:02:46,510 --> 04:02:51,560
I'd like to see how long
it will take to make it.

2612
04:02:57,930 --> 04:02:59,700
Can you hear this?

2613
04:03:05,080 --> 04:03:06,510
Oh, I did it.

2614
04:03:08,890 --> 04:03:10,430
I'm going to start.

2615
04:03:15,150 --> 04:03:16,150
The first round.

2616
04:03:18,940 --> 04:03:20,850
The second round.

2617
04:03:22,860 --> 04:03:25,050
I haven't done it yet.

2618
04:03:27,200 --> 04:03:29,230
The third round.

2619
04:03:32,860 --> 04:03:34,900
The fourth round.

2620
04:03:34,901 --> 04:03:36,420
5th week.

2621
04:03:36,421 --> 04:03:39,570
Are you okay?

2622
04:03:41,190 --> 04:03:42,930
You look fine.

2623
04:03:45,920 --> 04:03:46,920
5th week.

2624
04:03:49,350 --> 04:03:50,350
Oh, it's broken.

2625
04:03:57,785 --> 04:03:58,785
I don't know where it is.

2626
04:03:59,200 --> 04:04:00,260
Wait a minute.

2627
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:10,860
What?

2628
04:04:10,861 --> 04:04:14,060
Oh, I found it.

2629
04:04:32,490 --> 04:04:33,590
I can't find it.

2630
04:04:37,680 --> 04:04:40,010
I'll go get it.

2631
04:05:00,300 --> 04:05:01,610
I'm back.

2632
04:05:02,630 --> 04:05:04,050
Excuse me.

2633
04:05:05,860 --> 04:05:07,050
Let's continue.

2634
04:05:07,051 --> 04:05:08,130
I'll do my best.

2635
04:05:12,070 --> 04:05:13,150
How many weeks has it been?

2636
04:05:13,210 --> 04:05:14,210
6 weeks?

2637
04:05:14,400 --> 04:05:15,610
It's been 6 weeks, right?

2638
04:05:31,410 --> 04:05:32,410
How do I look?

2639
04:05:32,600 --> 04:05:33,600
Is it transparent?

2640
04:05:35,620 --> 04:05:37,740
Can you see?

2641
04:05:39,640 --> 04:05:40,720
Is it still okay?

2642
04:05:44,260 --> 04:05:45,600
I think it's almost transparent.

2643
04:05:51,680 --> 04:05:55,320
I'm going to take it off.

2644
04:05:58,375 --> 04:05:59,920
It's getting really hot.

2645
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:06,460
I feel like I'm being watched.

2646
04:06:06,461 --> 04:06:07,461
It's good.

2647
04:06:22,180 --> 04:06:24,500
I feel like summer is almost over.

2648
04:06:51,750 --> 04:06:52,750
I feel edgy.

2649
04:07:37,230 --> 04:07:38,340
I'm getting hot.

2650
04:09:14,290 --> 04:09:15,330
Ah, it feels good.

2651
04:09:49,150 --> 04:09:50,500
Ah, it feels so good.

2652
04:10:38,780 --> 04:10:39,820
Ah, it feels so good.

2653
04:10:56,510 --> 04:10:57,510
I can't do it.

2654
04:11:00,890 --> 04:11:02,310
It feels so good.

2655
04:11:02,890 --> 04:11:03,890
It's amazing.

2656
04:11:49,770 --> 04:12:37,720
I'm sorry that I feel good on my own.

2657
04:12:40,200 --> 04:12:41,680
I'm sorry that I feel good on my own.

2658
04:12:43,720 --> 04:12:47,460
Thank you for watching until the end.
