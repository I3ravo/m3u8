1
12.85 --> 14.85
 You can't see it, can you?

2
14.85 --> 16.85
 No, I can't.

3
18.85 --> 27.85
 First, take out the X like this.

4
30.85 --> 36.85
 Then, substitute it and get the Y value.

5
37.85 --> 44.85
 In the same way, let's try the second question.

6
46.85 --> 50.85
 Today, my parents are not at home.

7
50.85 --> 52.85
 Don't you want to hang out?

8
52.85 --> 54.85
 Let's go.

9
54.85 --> 56.85
 Don't you want to go to karaoke before that?

10
56.85 --> 58.85
 I want to go to the gym.

11
58.85 --> 60.85
 Let's go.

12
60.85 --> 62.85
 Let's go.

13
62.85 --> 64.85
 Everyone is free.

14
64.85 --> 66.85
 It's a good timing.

15
70.85 --> 72.85
 I can't see it.

16
72.85 --> 74.85
 I can't see it.

17
78.85 --> 80.85
 I can't see it at all.

18
82.85 --> 84.85
 I don't know at all.

19
88.85 --> 90.85
 Teacher.

20
90.85 --> 92.85
 Yes.

21
92.85 --> 94.85
 I can't see the 3.

22
94.85 --> 96.85
 3?

23
96.85 --> 104.13
 Yes.

24
104.13 --> 106.13
 It's not difficult.

25
106.13 --> 108.13
 I'm going to do it again.

26
108.13 --> 110.13
 Don't do this.

27
110.13 --> 112.13
 I'm going to solve this problem.

28
112.13 --> 116.13
 I can see it because I just apply it.

29
116.13 --> 118.13
 But, isn't it like an application?

30
118.13 --> 120.13
 Basically, it's the same.

31
120.13 --> 122.13
 It's just a little different.

32
122.13 --> 124.13
 It's just a little different.

33
130.13 --> 132.13
 Hikari, it's your tsutsuki.

34
132.13 --> 134.13
 Let me do it again.

35
134.13 --> 136.13
 I can't see it.

36
136.13 --> 138.13
 I can't see it.

37
138.13 --> 140.13
 I can't see it.

38
140.13 --> 142.13
 It's different from the previous one.

39
142.13 --> 144.13
 I can see it.

40
148.13 --> 150.13
 I see.

41
152.13 --> 154.13
 Do your best.

42
154.13 --> 156.13
 Yes.

43
156.13 --> 158.13
 I'm going to erase it.

44
158.13 --> 160.13
 Teacher.

45
160.13 --> 164.13
 Let me take a picture with my smartphone before I erase it.

46
164.13 --> 166.13
 You erased it.

47
166.13 --> 168.13
 I'm going to take a picture.

48
179.04 --> 181.04
 Can I take a picture?

49
181.04 --> 183.04
 Yes.

50
183.04 --> 185.04
 How can I do this?

51
185.04 --> 187.04
 I'm going to die.

52
189.04 --> 191.04
 I was curious about something.

53
191.04 --> 193.04
 What is it?

54
193.04 --> 197.70
 I don't know what it is.

55
197.70 --> 199.70
 Do you know this song?

56
199.70 --> 201.70
 I know this song.

57
201.70 --> 203.70
 Let's sing this song at karaoke.

58
203.70 --> 205.70
 Let's do it.

59
205.70 --> 207.70
 I've just started to learn this song.

60
207.70 --> 209.70
 Let's sing this song.

61
209.70 --> 211.70
 Let's do it.

62
211.70 --> 215.39
 I wonder if everyone is ready.

63
215.39 --> 217.39
 I'll send you the picture later.

64
219.39 --> 221.39
 Think about how to send it.

65
221.39 --> 223.39
 Yes.

66
225.39 --> 227.39
 Goodbye.

67
229.39 --> 231.39
 It's over.

68
235.09 --> 237.09
 I don't know what it is.

69
239.09 --> 241.09
 Let's take a picture.

70
241.09 --> 243.09
 Let's take a picture.

71
247.09 --> 249.09
 I made a mistake.

72
249.09 --> 251.09
 I made a mistake.

73
251.09 --> 253.09
 Did you take a picture?

74
253.09 --> 255.09
 Did you take a picture?

75
255.09 --> 257.09
 I'm going to take a picture.

76
266.86 --> 278.40
 I'll send you the picture later.

77
278.40 --> 280.40
 I'm glad it's over soon.

78
280.40 --> 284.42
 I was watching you.

79
284.42 --> 286.42
 Are you okay?

80
286.42 --> 290.24
 Are you okay?

81
290.24 --> 292.24
 What happened?

82
292.24 --> 294.24
 You were hit by a bus.

83
294.24 --> 296.24
 Are you okay?

84
296.24 --> 298.24
 You were hit by a bus.

85
298.24 --> 300.24
 I was hit by a bus.

86
325.87 --> 327.87
 Is it only a little?

87
327.87 --> 329.87
 You ate it.

88
331.87 --> 333.87
 I practiced to eat it.

89
333.87 --> 335.87
 I practiced to eat it.

90
339.87 --> 341.87
 You used a little.

91
341.87 --> 343.53
 I've seen people do that.

92
343.53 --> 345.09
 You put it on with tweezers?

93
345.09 --> 347.73
 I didn't know how to do it.

94
347.73 --> 349.05
 I was doing it by hand.

95
349.05 --> 350.57
 She was using tweezers.

96
350.57 --> 352.25
 I was like, how do you do that?

97
352.25 --> 353.69
 I'm doing it with my hands.

98
353.69 --> 355.31
 I've used tweezers before.

99
355.31 --> 356.35
 It was really hard.

100
356.35 --> 358.17
 Is it hard? I've done it before.

101
358.17 --> 360.31
 It feels like distance.

102
360.31 --> 361.13
 And it's off.

103
361.69 --> 363.95
 I'm going to take this girl.

104
363.95 --> 367.51
 When I'm hungry, I'll eat this.

105
367.51 --> 368.51
 I'm going to eat.

106
368.51 --> 371.19
 Aren't you going to karaoke soon?

107
371.19 --> 373.19
 What time is it now?

108
373.19 --> 375.19
 What time is it?

109
375.19 --> 378.50
 My phone...

110
378.50 --> 380.50
 I don't have my phone.

111
380.50 --> 382.50
 Really?

112
384.50 --> 386.50
 I always put my phone in my bag.

113
392.50 --> 394.50
 Can you let me use my phone?

114
394.50 --> 396.50
 Sure.

115
396.50 --> 398.50
 I put my phone in my bag.

116
398.50 --> 400.50
 I always put my phone in here.

117
400.50 --> 402.50
 I don't think it's here.

118
402.50 --> 404.50
 Can you put it on the wall?

119
404.50 --> 406.50
 I can't find it.

120
406.50 --> 408.50
 I don't think it's here.

121
408.50 --> 410.50
 Where is it?

122
414.50 --> 416.50
 It's my friend's phone.

123
418.50 --> 420.50
 What?

124
420.50 --> 422.50
 It's Kimura-sensei's phone.

125
422.50 --> 424.50
 It's Kimura-sensei's phone.

126
424.50 --> 426.50
 Kimura-sensei's phone?

127
426.50 --> 428.50
 Kimura-sensei's phone?

128
428.50 --> 430.50
 Kimura-sensei's phone?

129
430.50 --> 432.50
 I don't have it.

130
432.50 --> 434.50
 Do you have Nao's phone?

131
436.50 --> 438.50
 I'm glad to hear that.

132
440.50 --> 442.50
 Where did you get it?

133
442.50 --> 447.61
 I got it from someone.

134
447.61 --> 449.61
 Someone gave it to you?

135
449.61 --> 451.61
 Let's go get it.

136
451.61 --> 453.61
 If you have it, it's okay.

137
453.61 --> 455.61
 Please hold it.

138
455.61 --> 460.33
 We're going to get it.

139
460.33 --> 462.33
 Okay.

140
462.33 --> 464.33
 See you later.

141
466.33 --> 468.33
 I'm glad to hear that.

142
468.33 --> 470.33
 I'm glad to hear that.

143
470.33 --> 472.33
 Let's go get it.

144
472.33 --> 474.33
 Wait a minute.

145
474.33 --> 476.33
 Are you okay?

146
476.33 --> 478.33
 I'm okay.

147
478.33 --> 480.33
 I'm going to karaoke.

148
480.33 --> 482.33
 Wait a minute.

149
482.33 --> 484.33
 Can I call you first?

150
484.33 --> 486.33
 Can I wait?

151
486.33 --> 488.33
 Are you waiting?

152
488.33 --> 490.33
 Let's go.

153
490.33 --> 492.33
 Do you have it?

154
492.33 --> 494.33
 I'll get it soon.

155
526.70 --> 528.70
 Hibiki.

156
528.70 --> 530.70
 You have dropped your phone.

157
530.70 --> 532.70
 You dropped this, didn't you?

158
532.70 --> 534.70
 Yes, I did.

159
536.70 --> 541.70
 I heard the teacher at the school has it.

160
541.70 --> 544.70
 Yes, I delivered it.

161
544.70 --> 546.70
 Oh, really?

162
546.70 --> 547.70
 Yes.

163
548.70 --> 549.70
 Thank you.

164
549.70 --> 551.70
 You're a student there, aren't you?

165
551.70 --> 553.70
 Yes, I am.

166
554.70 --> 556.70
 Thank you.

167
556.70 --> 558.70
 I'll go get it.

168
558.70 --> 583.70
 Excuse me.

169
583.70 --> 590.41
 Kimura.

170
593.41 --> 596.41
 Oh, brother.

171
596.41 --> 601.41
 I had a light cake because it was Mohamed's week.

172
604.41 --> 606.41
 You look fine.

173
608.41 --> 614.41
 I'm sure I can hack you.

174
614.41 --> 616.41
 Oh, no.

175
616.41 --> 620.41
 I've already washed my feet since then.

176
620.41 --> 623.91
 Yes.

177
623.91 --> 625.91
 What did you say?

178
625.91 --> 628.67
 Oh.

179
630.67 --> 635.67
 You have a lot of gold in your life.

180
635.67 --> 641.67
 I just heard that the key was missing there.

181
642.67 --> 647.67
 Isn't this my student's cell phone?

182
652.67 --> 657.67
 Can you let me use your cell phone?

183
657.67 --> 658.67
 Sure.

184
658.67 --> 661.67
 Then let's talk.

185
667.33 --> 675.31
 He's coming.

186
675.31 --> 677.31
 Mr. Kimura.

187
678.31 --> 682.69
 It's dangerous if you drop your cell phone.

188
682.69 --> 684.69
 I'm glad.

189
684.69 --> 686.69
 I'm glad.

190
686.69 --> 688.69
 Let's go get it.

191
688.69 --> 689.69
 Yes.

192
689.69 --> 691.69
 Wait a minute.

193
691.69 --> 692.69
 Are you okay?

194
692.69 --> 694.69
 Yes, I'm fine.

195
694.69 --> 697.69
 I'm going to Karaoke.

196
697.69 --> 756.55
 Let me go.

197
756.55 --> 765.24
 Her name is Nao.

198
765.24 --> 769.19
 How do you know her?

199
770.19 --> 774.89
 She was in the student council.

200
775.89 --> 780.89
 That's my cell phone.

201
781.89 --> 783.89
 Why do you have it?

202
783.89 --> 792.50
 You said you left it to the teacher.

203
792.50 --> 797.22
 Please give it back.

204
797.22 --> 809.28
 I can't give it back if I get it.

205
809.28 --> 812.55
 What are you talking about?

206
812.55 --> 814.55
 It's a crime.

207
819.42 --> 824.63
 Are you all friends?

208
826.63 --> 830.33
 Are you close?

209
830.33 --> 835.24
 Don't touch me.

210
836.24 --> 840.45
 You're all cute.

211
840.45 --> 842.45
 Don't look at me.

212
844.45 --> 853.14
 You're cute.

213
860.43 --> 861.43
 Give it back.

214
861.43 --> 863.43
 What's wrong?

215
864.43 --> 866.43
 What's wrong?

216
868.43 --> 870.43
 What's wrong?

217
881.23 --> 883.23
 Give it back.

218
883.23 --> 885.23
 Take this off.

219
894.60 --> 918.50
 Do you think you can listen to me?

220
918.50 --> 920.50
 What are you doing?

221
923.50 --> 927.83
 It's delicious.

222
928.83 --> 930.83
 Give me more.

223
935.74 --> 937.74
 Give it to me.

224
939.74 --> 958.93
 I'll give you more.

225
968.54 --> 987.56
 I don't know what you're going to do to me.

226
993.46 --> 1003.22
 I like cute girls like you.

227
1004.22 --> 1020.45
 Don't do that.

228
1022.45 --> 1040.88
 I was rejected by you two years ago.

229
1042.88 --> 1050.84
 I've done too much.

230
1051.84 --> 1057.15
 I've been living without a job.

231
1059.66 --> 1069.10
 I don't want to get in there again.

232
1069.10 --> 1077.02
 Let's have fun.

233
1088.68 --> 1093.70
 I'll be nice to you.

234
1124.17 --> 1128.80
 I haven't felt like this in a long time.

235
1129.80 --> 1132.80
 What's wrong?

236
1135.80 --> 1137.80
 Don't look at me.

237
1138.80 --> 1157.13
 I haven't felt like this in a long time.

238
1161.13 --> 1163.13
 Don't look at me.

239
1164.13 --> 1167.13
 I can't stand this.

240
1167.13 --> 1169.13
 Don't look at me.

241
1191.69 --> 1193.69
 What's wrong?

242
1193.69 --> 1195.69
 Don't make me angry.

243
1207.10 --> 1234.35
 What's wrong?

244
1241.95 --> 1244.95
 How long are you going to hold it?

245
1257.82 --> 1315.94
 Don't do that.

246
1355.33 --> 1357.33
 It's delicious.

247
1365.04 --> 1369.67
 It's the same as before.

248
1374.67 --> 1379.46
 Don't do that.

249
1384.96 --> 1389.17
 It hurts, doesn't it?

250
1390.17 --> 1395.89
 You should be quiet.

251
1421.70 --> 1423.70
 What's wrong?

252
1442.50 --> 1447.77
 Do you feel good?

253
1463.84 --> 1468.41
 Don't make me angry.

254
1475.88 --> 1482.77
 Don't make me angry.

255
1490.10 --> 1493.73
 Where is this?

256
1513.55 --> 1519.78
 It hurts when it's hard.

257
1531.36 --> 1534.36
 It hurts when it's hard.

258
1555.38 --> 1564.42
 You should run away.

259
1566.42 --> 1572.02
 You should run away.

260
1589.10 --> 1592.10
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

261
1622.83 --> 1632.33
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

262
1632.33 --> 1635.33
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

263
1635.33 --> 1638.33
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

264
1638.33 --> 1641.33
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

265
1641.33 --> 1644.33
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

266
1644.33 --> 1647.33
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

267
1647.33 --> 1654.46
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

268
1654.46 --> 1665.07
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

269
1665.07 --> 1668.07
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

270
1668.07 --> 1672.70
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

271
1672.70 --> 1675.70
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

272
1675.70 --> 1681.55
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

273
1681.55 --> 1684.55
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

274
1684.55 --> 1699.01
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

275
1699.01 --> 1712.25
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

276
1712.25 --> 1724.66
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

277
1724.66 --> 1734.15
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

278
1734.15 --> 1737.15
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

279
1737.15 --> 1744.60
 It's been a long time since I've seen you.

280
1760.18 --> 1763.18
 I'm not going to do anything.

281
1771.50 --> 1778.50
 I don't know yet.

282
1788.05 --> 1791.05
 I don't know yet.

283
1806.05 --> 1809.05
 I don't know.

284
1833.02 --> 1836.02
 I don't know.

285
1880.30 --> 1883.30
 I don't know.

286
1893.99 --> 1896.99
 I don't know.

287
1907.92 --> 1937.61
 I don't know.

288
1982.50 --> 1985.50
 It's not over yet.

289
2025.50 --> 2028.50
 If you hold it in, you'll die.

290
2041.06 --> 2083.16
 If you hold it in, you'll die.

291
2083.16 --> 2086.16
 You're not going to die.

292
2086.16 --> 2091.43
 You're not going to die.

293
2104.30 --> 2128.38
 You're feeling better, aren't you?

294
2128.38 --> 2133.27
 You're feeling better, aren't you?

295
2133.27 --> 2136.27
 What's wrong?

296
2137.27 --> 2140.27
 You're in a bad mood again.

297
2140.27 --> 2143.27
 You're in a bad mood again.

298
2154.22 --> 2165.19
 You don't like to live alone.

299
2170.19 --> 2193.19
 You don't like to live alone.

300
2197.19 --> 2200.19
 You're late.

301
2200.19 --> 2203.19
 You're right.

302
2203.19 --> 2206.19
 You're taking a long time.

303
2206.19 --> 2209.19
 You're taking a long time.

304
2209.19 --> 2212.19
 You're right.

305
2213.19 --> 2217.76
 You want to go to karaoke.

306
2241.29 --> 2244.29
 I'm going to move the GPS.

307
2257.98 --> 2266.19
 Yuka.

308
2273.99 --> 2276.99
 I found my cell phone.

309
2280.99 --> 2283.99
 All right. I'm going.

310
2283.99 --> 2286.99
 All right. I'm going.

311
2286.99 --> 2304.68
 Hurry up.

312
2304.68 --> 2310.21
 You're going to be mean to Yuka, aren't you?

313
2310.21 --> 2313.21
 You're mean.

314
2313.21 --> 2316.21
 Don't do anything with Yuka.

315
2318.84 --> 2324.94
 Then you can do anything.

316
2331.26 --> 2339.86
 You can do anything.

317
2339.86 --> 2342.86
 Because of Yuka.

318
2348.86 --> 2351.86
 I'm going to pick up Nao.

319
2351.86 --> 2354.86
 I heard that the teacher is helping you.

320
2354.86 --> 2356.86
 What? Why?

321
2356.86 --> 2358.86
 I don't know. I'll be right back.

322
2358.86 --> 2359.86
 Okay.

323
2359.86 --> 2360.86
 I'll be waiting.

324
2360.86 --> 2362.86
 Okay, wait for me.

325
2362.86 --> 2363.86
 What?

326
2363.86 --> 2365.86
 You wanted to help me, didn't you?

327
2365.86 --> 2367.86
 Shut up!

328
2368.86 --> 2374.34
 No!

329
2476.15 --> 2477.15
 It's open.

330
2497.98 --> 2501.55
 You came.

331
2516.51 --> 2518.51
 Don't make a noise.

332
2519.51 --> 2521.51
 Are you two friends?

333
2528.70 --> 2529.70
 Let me go.

334
2529.70 --> 2531.70
 Kimura, tell her.

335
2534.70 --> 2540.03
 You're a good boy.

336
2544.03 --> 2547.73
 But...

337
2547.73 --> 2550.73
 I can't go against him.

338
2551.73 --> 2553.73
 So I brought you here.

339
2554.73 --> 2562.86
 If you hate him, you should hate your friend.

340
2562.86 --> 2564.86
 It's bitter.

341
2564.86 --> 2568.86
 You should have told him to go to me.

342
2571.86 --> 2575.86
 Well, I don't like violence.

343
2575.86 --> 2577.86
 Have fun.

344
2579.86 --> 2581.86
 Have fun.

345
2591.50 --> 2593.50
 Have fun.

346
2595.50 --> 2597.50
 I don't want to go.

347
2597.50 --> 2601.20
 I don't want to go.

348
2604.20 --> 2609.66
 I'll be your friend.

349
2627.12 --> 2629.12
 I don't want to go.

350
2629.12 --> 2635.89
 I don't want to go.

351
2643.82 --> 2645.82
 Be quiet.

352
2647.82 --> 2649.82
 It hurts, doesn't it?

353
2650.82 --> 2652.82
 I don't want to go.

354
2654.82 --> 2656.82
 Don't make a noise.

355
2660.82 --> 2662.82
 It hurts, doesn't it?

356
2665.82 --> 2667.82
 It hurts, doesn't it?

357
2715.46 --> 2718.46
 I've been nice to you.

358
2719.46 --> 2721.46
 I'm sorry.

359
2727.54 --> 2728.54
 I'm sorry.

360
2728.54 --> 2731.54
 You're a good boy.

361
2731.54 --> 2734.54
 You trusted me.

362
2734.54 --> 2740.62
 I like your stupidity.

363
2767.40 --> 2769.40
 It hurts, doesn't it?

364
2810.34 --> 2812.34
 It hurts, doesn't it?

365
2812.34 --> 2814.34
 I can't help it.

366
2817.34 --> 2821.34
 You shouldn't be so violent.

367
2824.34 --> 2826.34
 You're so cool.

368
2826.34 --> 2828.34
 What's going on?

369
2828.34 --> 2830.34
 What's going on?

370
2830.34 --> 2832.34
 You're so cool.

371
2832.34 --> 2834.34
 You're a good boy.

372
2844.34 --> 2846.34
 Look at me.

373
2846.34 --> 2848.34
 I'm your friend.

374
2854.34 --> 2856.34
 You're a good boy.

375
2857.34 --> 2859.34
 I'm your friend.

376
2917.29 --> 2919.29
 You're a good boy.

377
2919.29 --> 2921.29
 This way?

378
2921.29 --> 2923.29
 I like this better.

379
2923.29 --> 2926.29
 I don't like this hair style, but I like it.

380
2926.29 --> 2928.29
 This way?

381
2928.29 --> 2930.29
 You like it, don't you?

382
2930.29 --> 2932.29
 You're so cool.

383
2933.29 --> 2936.29
 You look like Kimura-sensei.

384
2936.29 --> 2938.29
 No, I don't.

385
2938.29 --> 2940.29
 You look like Kimura-sensei.

386
2946.29 --> 2950.24
 Look at me.

387
2954.24 --> 2960.24
 If you don't look at me, I'll push you.

388
2961.24 --> 2963.24
 Look at me.

389
2994.44 --> 2996.44
 You're a good boy.

390
3000.44 --> 3002.44
 Did you learn a lot from me?

391
3005.44 --> 3007.44
 You're a good boy.

392
3064.66 --> 3070.09
 Do you want to drink more?

393
3088.22 --> 3090.22
 I don't want to.

394
3092.22 --> 3094.22
 Don't do that.

395
3111.71 --> 3113.71
 Look at me.

396
3116.15 --> 3118.15
 Be quiet.

397
3120.15 --> 3123.15
 Look at me.

398
3125.15 --> 3131.70
 You don't have to do that.

399
3133.70 --> 3138.14
 You don't want to die, do you?

400
3140.14 --> 3143.14
 Oh, it's tight.

401
3147.14 --> 3150.14
 What is it?

402
3150.14 --> 3153.14
 What is it?

403
3157.14 --> 3160.14
 You're doing a little thing.

404
3165.34 --> 3168.34
 This is it.

405
3170.34 --> 3175.03
 Call your friends here.

406
3175.03 --> 3178.73
 I don't want to be put inside.

407
3178.73 --> 3180.73
 Hello.

408
3180.73 --> 3187.54
 How long can you wait?

409
3187.54 --> 3208.14
 Yuka?

410
3208.14 --> 3210.14
 It's broken.

411
3210.14 --> 3211.14
 What?

412
3211.14 --> 3213.14
 It's broken.

413
3213.14 --> 3214.14
 I don't know.

414
3214.14 --> 3216.14
 He told me to go home early.

415
3216.14 --> 3218.14
 Go home early?

416
3218.14 --> 3219.14
 That's all?

417
3219.14 --> 3220.14
 That's all.

418
3220.14 --> 3222.14
 It suddenly broke.

419
3224.14 --> 3225.14
 I don't know.

420
3225.14 --> 3226.14
 I don't know.

421
3226.14 --> 3230.14
 Maybe he's being compensated by the teacher.

422
3230.14 --> 3232.14
 Isn't that crazy?

423
3232.14 --> 3234.14
 It's funny.

424
3234.14 --> 3236.14
 You wanted to go, didn't you?

425
3236.14 --> 3238.14
 I want to go.

426
3238.14 --> 3241.14
 I'm going home.

427
3241.14 --> 3244.14
 I'm going to stay at a karaoke.

428
3244.14 --> 3246.14
 That's right.

429
3246.14 --> 3249.14
 I wanted to stay at a karaoke.

430
3249.14 --> 3252.14
 That's true.

431
3252.14 --> 3255.14
 I don't have a mom and dad.

432
3255.14 --> 3257.14
 That's true.

433
3257.14 --> 3259.14
 I'm alone after all.

434
3259.14 --> 3262.14
 I can enjoy it alone.

435
3262.14 --> 3264.14
 I can do it at home.

436
3264.14 --> 3266.14
 That's true.

437
3266.14 --> 3268.14
 Let's eat sushi.

438
3268.14 --> 3270.14
 That's great.

439
3270.14 --> 3272.14
 I'm waiting for a picture.

440
3272.14 --> 3274.14
 Let's eat sushi.

441
3274.14 --> 3275.14
 Just a picture?

442
3275.14 --> 3277.14
 I'm waiting.

443
3277.14 --> 3279.14
 Let's do this again.

444
3279.14 --> 3289.87
 Let's do that.

445
3289.87 --> 3290.87
 What are you talking about?

446
3290.87 --> 3297.49
 You're a really nice guy.

447
3297.49 --> 3300.49
 Do you want to be put inside?

448
3302.49 --> 3307.50
 I can't help it.

449
3308.50 --> 3311.50
 You didn't listen to me.

450
3315.50 --> 3317.50
 I'll let you out.

451
3355.32 --> 3360.32
 You're a really nice guy.

452
3362.32 --> 3367.32
 You're kind to your friends.

453
3369.32 --> 3372.32
 I know that.

454
3376.32 --> 3385.88
 You didn't call your friends.

455
3387.88 --> 3403.98
 You're going to be with us until we're satisfied.

456
3411.61 --> 3426.54
 You're a really nice guy.

457
3467.82 --> 3469.82
 You're a really nice guy.

458
3485.82 --> 3487.82
 Stop it.

459
3499.70 --> 3501.70
 Stop it.

460
3528.18 --> 3530.18
 Stop it.

461
3532.18 --> 3534.18
 Stop it.

462
3535.18 --> 3537.18
 I'm going.

463
3537.18 --> 3539.18
 Stop it.

464
3572.92 --> 3574.92
 You're going to be with us until we're satisfied.

465
3598.86 --> 3605.06
 Stop it.

466
3643.58 --> 3674.47
 Stop it.

467
3674.47 --> 3682.56
 Why did you do that?

468
3688.56 --> 3690.56
 Why did you deceive me?

469
3691.56 --> 3693.56
 I didn't deceive you.

470
3696.56 --> 3699.56
 You said you'd help me.

471
3699.56 --> 3700.56
 What?

472
3700.56 --> 3702.56
 You said you'd help me.

473
3703.56 --> 3705.56
 I did.

474
3705.56 --> 3710.56
 You deceived me.

475
3712.56 --> 3722.74
 You're going to be with us until we're satisfied.

476
3728.74 --> 3730.74
 I'll put you in again.

477
3730.74 --> 3732.74
 You have to do it.

478
3732.74 --> 3734.74
 No.

479
3735.74 --> 3738.74
 Don't do that.

480
3738.74 --> 3740.74
 You do it.

481
3741.74 --> 3743.74
 You have to do it.

482
3744.74 --> 3746.74
 Tanaka, look.

483
3750.30 --> 3752.30
 What are you going to do?

484
3752.30 --> 3754.30
 Stop it.

485
3755.30 --> 3756.30
 I'm going.

486
3756.30 --> 3758.30
 You have to do it.

487
3759.30 --> 3761.30
 I'm going.

488
3763.30 --> 3765.30
 You have to do it.

489
3765.30 --> 3767.30
 You have to do it.

490
3780.10 --> 3782.10
 You have to do it.

491
3792.08 --> 3811.26
 You have to do it.

492
3813.26 --> 3815.26
 What are you going to do?

493
3821.26 --> 3823.26
 Look at me.

494
3823.26 --> 3825.26
 Your mouth is hurting.

495
3827.26 --> 3829.26
 You have to do it.

496
3832.26 --> 3834.26
 Good boy.

497
3850.26 --> 3853.26
 He is eating very well.

498
3863.26 --> 3866.83
 What's wrong?

499
3876.26 --> 3878.26
 Stop it.

500
3879.26 --> 3886.86
 Stop it.

501
3886.86 --> 3888.86
 No.

502
3891.86 --> 3907.02
 You are great.

503
3907.02 --> 3909.02
 One more time.

504
3924.02 --> 3926.02
 You are great.

505
3928.02 --> 3930.02
 You are great.

506
3935.02 --> 3937.02
 It's hard.

507
3982.42 --> 4003.46
 He is looking at the desk.

508
4004.46 --> 4016.22
 You are next.

509
4025.64 --> 4043.64
 Stick out your butt.

510
4043.64 --> 4045.64
 You are great.

511
4160.23 --> 4162.23
 You are great.

512
4187.23 --> 4189.23
 Let's go to the other two.

513
4190.23 --> 4192.23
 Here you are.

514
4192.23 --> 4194.23
 You don't know your address, do you?

515
4217.17 --> 4224.17
 I wanted to stay with you because you were not here.

516
4225.17 --> 4227.17
 I'm bored.

517
4227.17 --> 4231.17
 I'll eat sushi or something.

518
4231.17 --> 4234.17
 I'll order something expensive.

519
4239.82 --> 4241.82
 Who is it?

520
4242.82 --> 4250.23
 Good evening.

521
4250.23 --> 4252.23
 Good evening.

522
4252.23 --> 4254.23
 What's wrong?

523
4254.23 --> 4258.23
 I didn't see your parents today.

524
4258.23 --> 4261.61
 What's wrong?

525
4262.61 --> 4264.61
 Do you have something to do?

526
4269.65 --> 4271.65
 You dropped your cell phone, didn't you?

527
4272.65 --> 4274.65
 Cell phone?

528
4278.79 --> 4280.79
 I didn't drop it.

529
4282.79 --> 4286.79
 You went to pick up Tanaka and Saito, didn't you?

530
4286.79 --> 4289.79
 Nao, I'm going to pick you up.

531
4289.79 --> 4290.79
 Did something happen?

532
4290.79 --> 4293.79
 My teacher helped me.

533
4293.79 --> 4295.79
 What?

534
4295.79 --> 4297.79
 I don't know. I'll be back soon.

535
4297.79 --> 4299.79
 Okay. I'll wait for you.

536
4299.79 --> 4301.79
 Wait for me.

537
4302.79 --> 4306.79
 By the way, what did you do after that?

538
4306.79 --> 4308.79
 Did you do something?

539
4310.79 --> 4314.79
 You didn't come back at all.

540
4318.49 --> 4321.49
 I was wondering if you were doing something.

541
4321.49 --> 4325.38
 I was talking to Kana.

542
4325.38 --> 4331.38
 Why do you think Tanaka and Saito didn't come back?

543
4333.82 --> 4335.82
 What?

544
4335.82 --> 4337.82
 Is it a quiz?

545
4340.82 --> 4345.19
 Why? It's not a reward, is it?

546
4345.19 --> 4350.19
 Didn't you get a call from Sakurai?

547
4351.19 --> 4353.19
 Hey, Yuka.

548
4354.19 --> 4356.19
 What?

549
4356.19 --> 4358.19
 He hung up.

550
4358.19 --> 4359.19
 What?

551
4359.19 --> 4360.19
 He hung up.

552
4360.19 --> 4363.19
 I don't know. He told me to go home early.

553
4363.19 --> 4365.19
 Go home early?

554
4365.19 --> 4366.19
 That's all?

555
4366.19 --> 4368.19
 That's all.

556
4368.19 --> 4371.19
 Did he tell you to go home early?

557
4371.19 --> 4375.50
 Why do you think he said that?

558
4379.50 --> 4381.50
 I don't know.

559
4381.50 --> 4383.50
 Do you know?

560
4384.50 --> 4386.50
 Tell me.

561
4386.50 --> 4388.50
 I want to know.

562
4388.50 --> 4394.50
 We were supposed to stay here tonight.

563
4395.50 --> 4397.50
 I see.

564
4400.46 --> 4402.46
 After that,

565
4403.46 --> 4411.77
 Tanaka and Saito had a lot of fun with my uncle.

566
4411.77 --> 4413.77
 What?

567
4414.77 --> 4416.77
 What are you talking about?

568
4416.77 --> 4418.77
 Who is your uncle?

569
4418.77 --> 4421.77
 He told me to call you.

570
4421.77 --> 4424.77
 Call your friends here.

571
4424.77 --> 4430.06
 I won't.

572
4430.06 --> 4433.57
 You have good friends.

573
4433.57 --> 4436.88
 What?

574
4437.88 --> 4441.88
 He told me to go home early.

575
4441.88 --> 4449.09
 He told me to go home early.

576
4449.09 --> 4453.04
 What?

577
4453.04 --> 4455.04
 You have good friends.

578
4455.04 --> 4459.61
 What?

579
4459.61 --> 4463.61
 That's why I came here.

580
4487.74 --> 4489.74
 What are you doing?

581
4489.74 --> 4492.74
 Do you want to have fun with me?

582
4492.74 --> 4517.88
 Do you know what you're doing?

583
4541.34 --> 4545.98
 Do you know what you're doing?

584
4545.98 --> 4547.98
 I don't know what you're talking about.

585
4547.98 --> 4557.22
 Do you want to have fun with me?

586
4568.82 --> 4572.82
 I don't want to do this.

587
4572.82 --> 4576.82
 I don't think you're in a good mood.

588
4579.82 --> 4581.82
 No.

589
4584.82 --> 4586.82
 I'm sorry.

590
4586.82 --> 4588.82
 I'm sorry.

591
4588.82 --> 4592.82
 It's not my fault.

592
4592.82 --> 4594.82
 It's not your fault?

593
4594.82 --> 4596.82
 It's not my fault.

594
4596.82 --> 4598.82
 It hurts.

595
4598.82 --> 4602.82
 What do you know about me?

596
4602.82 --> 4611.64
 I'm sick of you.

597
4611.64 --> 4614.64
 What do you know about me?

598
4614.64 --> 4617.64
 What do you know about me?

599
4619.64 --> 4621.64
 You are kind.

600
4621.64 --> 4625.64
 You are kind.

601
4625.64 --> 4627.64
 You are kind.

602
4627.64 --> 4630.64
 You are kind.

603
4632.64 --> 4636.64
 You always play in class.

604
4636.64 --> 4640.64
 You don't listen to the class.

605
4640.64 --> 4644.91
 Ugh.

606
4644.91 --> 4649.91
 You always play in class.

607
4651.91 --> 4661.74
 You're a good boy.

608
4661.74 --> 4665.74
 You're a good boy.

609
4675.65 --> 4677.65
 Don't do it.

610
4677.65 --> 4680.65
 Don't do it.

611
4681.65 --> 4683.65
 I'm sorry.

612
4719.76 --> 4721.76
 You are a child.

613
4721.76 --> 4723.76
 But you have a strong body.

614
4761.60 --> 4763.60
 Don't worry.

615
4763.60 --> 4765.60
 If you are calm,

616
4766.60 --> 4768.60
 You will feel better soon.

617
4775.54 --> 4777.54
 At first, you were angry.

618
4777.54 --> 4779.54
 But you became calm soon.

619
4829.30 --> 4832.61
 You talked to your teacher.

620
4834.61 --> 4836.61
 Your pants are messed up.

621
4849.07 --> 4851.07
 Your pants are messed up.

622
4858.58 --> 4860.58
 How can I go home?

623
4862.58 --> 4866.91
 I have to punish you.

624
4866.91 --> 4868.91
 Teacher!

625
4882.91 --> 4884.91
 I'm sorry.

626
4886.91 --> 4892.66
 I'm sorry.

627
4892.66 --> 4917.54
 Don't cry.

628
4925.78 --> 4927.78
 You are angry.

629
4927.78 --> 4929.78
 Your teacher doesn't understand you.

630
4933.78 --> 4935.78
 You are angry.

631
4935.78 --> 4937.78
 Don't cry.

632
4948.50 --> 4950.50
 You are angry.

633
4956.21 --> 4960.48
 Your pants are messed up.

634
4962.48 --> 4964.48
 I like my teacher.

635
4969.65 --> 4971.65
 Your teacher will make you feel better.

636
4971.65 --> 4973.65
 I'm glad.

637
4985.60 --> 4987.60
 Don't say that.

638
4987.60 --> 4989.60
 You don't have to feel bad.

639
4989.60 --> 4991.60
 Look at this.

640
4995.60 --> 4997.60
 You like me, don't you?

641
4999.60 --> 5001.60
 Please eat this.

642
5005.60 --> 5007.60
 You like me, don't you?

643
5007.60 --> 5009.60
 Please eat a lot.

644
5023.15 --> 5069.25
 Please eat a lot.

645
5112.80 --> 5114.80
 Your pants are messed up.

646
5126.66 --> 5128.66
 You are angry.

647
5132.42 --> 5134.42
 Do you feel good?

648
5151.81 --> 5178.48
 Your pants are messed up.

649
5180.48 --> 5182.48
 What are you doing?

650
5182.48 --> 5184.48
 Take off your pants.

651
5190.48 --> 5192.48
 Take off your pants.

652
5202.24 --> 5204.24
 You look good.

653
5206.24 --> 5208.24
 Take off your pants.

654
5208.24 --> 5210.24
 Take off your pants.

655
5217.22 --> 5219.22
 Take off your pants.

656
5219.22 --> 5236.19
 Don't do that.

657
5242.19 --> 5244.19
 Take off your pants.

658
5244.19 --> 5253.46
 Take off your pants.

659
5274.75 --> 5276.75
 Don't do that.

660
5303.25 --> 5305.25
 Be happy.

661
5307.25 --> 5309.25
 You have sex with your teacher.

662
5311.25 --> 5325.82
 Don't do that.

663
5325.82 --> 5353.20
 Take off your pants.

664
5402.32 --> 5404.32
 What do you want?

665
5404.32 --> 5418.19
 It doesn't matter if I'm happy or not.

666
5420.19 --> 5422.19
 It doesn't matter if I feel good or not.

667
5433.63 --> 5440.78
 You are nervous.

668
5440.78 --> 5448.80
 You are nervous.

669
5448.80 --> 5458.90
 Don't you feel good?

670
5460.90 --> 5462.90
 It's the worst.

671
5462.90 --> 5464.90
 It's the worst.

672
5464.90 --> 5466.90
 What's the worst?

673
5468.90 --> 5470.90
 What's the worst?

674
5487.62 --> 5489.62
 You look like you're going to cry.

675
5489.62 --> 5494.40
 You look good.

676
5502.46 --> 5512.82
 Take off your pants.

677
5523.10 --> 5525.10
 You look like you're going to cry.

678
5554.85 --> 5556.85
 Take off your pants.

679
5558.85 --> 5560.85
 Take off your pants.

680
5580.29 --> 5593.07
 What should I do?

681
5595.07 --> 5598.58
 Take off your pants.

682
5610.10 --> 5649.76
 What are you doing?

683
5654.74 --> 5656.74
 Let go of me.

684
5664.67 --> 5666.67
 What were you trying to do?

685
5666.67 --> 5668.67
 What were you trying to do?

686
5668.67 --> 5670.67
 What were you trying to do?

687
5670.67 --> 5672.67
 You can't do that.

688
5676.67 --> 5678.67
 You have to punish the bad girl.

689
5690.40 --> 5692.40
 You have to punish the bad girl.

690
5754.67 --> 5756.67
 That's why she gets angry.

691
5756.67 --> 5763.24
 Hey, if you keep calm, I'll make you feel better.

692
5765.24 --> 5766.24
 Hey!

693
5776.98 --> 5784.02
 Oh, it's in again.

694
5787.02 --> 5788.02
 It's messed up, isn't it?

695
5791.02 --> 5796.83
 Look at your teacher's face.

696
5800.87 --> 5801.87
 Your favorite teacher's face.

697
5825.11 --> 5826.11
 Huh?

698
5827.11 --> 5828.11
 What are you doing?

699
5853.14 --> 5854.14
 Say, it's good.

700
5863.05 --> 5864.05
 Say, it's good.

701
5871.16 --> 5872.16
 It's good, isn't it?

702
5874.16 --> 5875.16
 Huh?

703
5876.16 --> 5934.42
 You put it in again.

704
5944.94 --> 5945.94
 I don't know.

705
5946.94 --> 5948.94
 You should think about it yourself.

706
5959.30 --> 5960.30
 Say, it's good.

707
5967.81 --> 5986.82
 Will you marry me?

708
5992.80 --> 5999.18
 You liked that, didn't you?

709
6008.01 --> 6020.94
 No!

710
6054.52 --> 6058.82
 Your face is tattered.

711
6060.82 --> 6061.82
 Was it that scary?

712
6068.61 --> 6069.61
 It's a joke.

713
6071.61 --> 6072.61
 It's a joke.

714
6072.61 --> 6073.61
 It's a joke.

715
6073.61 --> 6074.61
 I'm sorry.

716
6075.61 --> 6076.61
 It's a joke.

717
6077.61 --> 6078.61
 I can't do that.

718
6079.61 --> 6080.61
 What are you talking about?

719
6081.61 --> 6082.61
 So, forgive me.

720
6086.61 --> 6087.61
 I'll be kind to you.

721
6090.61 --> 6091.61
 I'm sorry.

722
6098.61 --> 6100.61
 What are you talking about?

723
6101.61 --> 6102.61
 It's a joke.

724
6103.61 --> 6104.61
 All of them?

725
6105.61 --> 6106.61
 Yes, all of them.

726
6109.61 --> 6110.61
 Nao, too?

727
6111.61 --> 6112.61
 Yes, all of them.

728
6116.61 --> 6117.61
 What should I do?

729
6121.61 --> 6122.61
 What should I do?

730
6124.61 --> 6125.61
 What should I do?

731
6125.61 --> 6128.37
 What should I do?

732
6138.95 --> 6139.95
 What should I do?

733
6160.27 --> 6161.27
 Oh, no.

734
6189.33 --> 6190.33
 I'll forgive you.

735
6193.41 --> 6194.41
 I'll forgive you.

736
6203.22 --> 6204.22
 I'll forgive you.

737
6233.66 --> 6234.66
 You hate me, don't you?

738
6234.66 --> 6238.76
 You hate me, don't you?

739
6239.76 --> 6240.76
 No, I don't.

740
6249.13 --> 6250.13
 Show me your face.

741
6251.13 --> 6252.13
 Show me your face.

742
6253.13 --> 6324.75
 No, I don't.

743
6324.75 --> 6325.75
 I'm going home now.

744
6330.50 --> 6331.50
 And...

745
6332.50 --> 6333.50
 I'm not here anymore.

746
6345.50 --> 6380.06
 He always comes home early.

747
6381.06 --> 6389.46
 He always comes home early.

748
6390.46 --> 6391.46
 Why?

749
6401.77 --> 6402.77
 Is he sleeping?

750
6403.77 --> 6404.77
 Let's go.

751
6685.30 --> 6686.30
 Who are you?

752
6688.30 --> 6689.30
 Who are you?

753
6702.95 --> 6703.95
 Don't make a noise.

754
6711.95 --> 6712.95
 Don't make a noise.

755
6713.95 --> 6714.95
 Don't make a noise.

756
6717.95 --> 6718.95
 Don't make a noise.

757
6721.95 --> 6722.95
 I told you to be quiet.

758
6743.14 --> 6744.14
 Don't make a noise.

759
6749.24 --> 6760.45
 I told you to be quiet.

760
6783.34 --> 6785.34
 I don't want to go to your parents.

761
6791.34 --> 6792.34
 I told you to be quiet.

762
6806.37 --> 6807.37
 I told you to be quiet.

763
6850.28 --> 6851.28
 I don't want to go to your parents.

764
6856.02 --> 6857.02
 I told you to be quiet.

765
6861.02 --> 6862.02
 You don't like the pain, do you?

766
6869.02 --> 6870.02
 You don't like the pain, do you?

767
6972.67 --> 6973.67
 Is it better?

768
6973.67 --> 6975.67
 What are you doing?

769
7046.21 --> 7049.21
 You have a good friend.

770
7052.21 --> 7054.21
 What do you mean?

771
7055.21 --> 7057.21
 Nao-chan.

772
7059.21 --> 7061.21
 And Yuka-chan.

773
7062.21 --> 7064.21
 Did you do something to them?

774
7065.21 --> 7067.21
 What did you do?

775
7067.21 --> 7069.21
 It's the same.

776
7070.21 --> 7072.21
 You have a good friend.

777
7078.38 --> 7080.38
 Be quiet.

778
7083.33 --> 7085.33
 You have a good friend.

779
7099.15 --> 7101.15
 You have a good friend.

780
7101.15 --> 7103.15
 You have a good friend.

781
7105.15 --> 7108.91
 You have a good friend.

782
7109.91 --> 7111.91
 What did you do to them?

783
7113.91 --> 7115.91
 Don't worry.

784
7115.91 --> 7117.91
 They are still alive.

785
7119.91 --> 7121.91
 They are still alive.

786
7121.91 --> 7123.91
 We have to kill them.

787
7125.91 --> 7127.91
 Don't worry.

788
7128.91 --> 7130.91
 We will kill them.

789
7130.91 --> 7132.91
 No.

790
7132.91 --> 7134.91
 No.

791
7135.91 --> 7212.38
 No.

792
7217.38 --> 7228.56
 You don't want to die, do you?

793
7230.56 --> 7235.15
 You don't want to die, do you?

794
7236.15 --> 7240.36
 You have good friends.

795
7256.06 --> 7261.81
 You have good friends.

796
7262.81 --> 7272.62
 Go to sleep.

797
7272.62 --> 7274.62
 You should go to sleep.

798
7287.35 --> 7377.19
 You don't want to die, do you?

799
7382.23 --> 7384.23
 You don't want to die, do you?

800
7384.23 --> 7386.23
 Don't be a coward.

801
7386.23 --> 7420.01
 Don't be a coward.

802
7420.01 --> 7422.01
 Take it.

803
7422.01 --> 7440.84
 Take it.

804
7440.84 --> 7442.84
 If you are so quiet, you will be scolded.

805
7442.84 --> 7447.62
 I'm fine.

806
7447.62 --> 7449.62
 I'm fine.

807
7451.62 --> 7453.62
 They were also cowards.

808
7453.62 --> 7455.62
 They were also cowards.

809
7455.62 --> 7460.02
 Take it.

810
7498.57 --> 7500.57
 Turn your back.

811
7500.57 --> 7504.58
 Take it.

812
7506.58 --> 7520.20
 Do you want more?

813
7522.20 --> 7524.20
 Do you want more?

814
7537.83 --> 7589.34
 My dick is comfortable, isn't it?

815
7595.34 --> 7598.90
 I'll leave you wet.

816
7624.62 --> 7626.62
 I'm not a coward.

817
7635.29 --> 7637.29
 Don't you want more?

818
7641.29 --> 7643.29
 Look at me.

819
7643.29 --> 7645.29
 I won't let you go.

820
7645.29 --> 7647.29
 Look at me.

821
7647.29 --> 7652.65
 I beg you.

822
7652.65 --> 7654.65
 I beg you.

823
7654.65 --> 7658.41
 Look at me.

824
7662.23 --> 7664.23
 Don't you want more?

825
7739.64 --> 7751.46
 I won't let you go.

826
7751.46 --> 7753.46
 Look at me.

827
7753.46 --> 7799.05
 I won't let you go.

828
7871.19 --> 7995.82
 I won't do it again.

829
8023.32 --> 8028.62
 Your friends

830
8028.62 --> 8032.06
 Are raping you.

831
8035.56 --> 8037.56
 Keep it.
