1
9.20 --> 14.20
 It's smelly. Can you stop smoking?

2
58.50 --> 62.50
 I was attracted to him.

3
62.50 --> 68.34
 Hey!

4
69.34 --> 72.67
 Hey!

5
72.67 --> 75.67
 Hey, you're here. Answer me.

6
75.67 --> 78.67
 I told you not to call me hey.

7
78.67 --> 83.90
 Don't say you're not here.

8
83.90 --> 85.90
 Where's the nail clipper?

9
85.90 --> 88.90
 It's in the second drawer.

10
89.90 --> 127.43
 You seem to have a hard time.

11
127.43 --> 135.64
 I can hear your quarrel from time to time.

12
135.64 --> 142.45
 Do you want me to apologize?

13
142.45 --> 232.54
 Not really.

14
293.61 --> 298.11
 I've been worried about you.

15
298.11 --> 300.11
 Your wife is inviting me, isn't she?

16
300.11 --> 304.00
 What are you talking about?

17
304.00 --> 307.00
 You're not satisfied, aren't you?

18
307.00 --> 311.46
 I knew it.

19
314.46 --> 323.47
 Stop it.

20
323.47 --> 325.47
 Stop it.

21
325.47 --> 349.04
 I'm sorry.

22
349.04 --> 395.62
 I'm sorry.

23
440.50 --> 447.78
 I'm sorry.

24
452.46 --> 454.46
 Stop it.

25
474.67 --> 476.67
 You're in a good condition.

26
477.67 --> 479.67
 Stop it.

27
479.67 --> 487.08
 Stop it.

28
488.08 --> 494.34
 You're in a good condition, aren't you?

29
494.34 --> 496.34
 No.

30
497.34 --> 503.08
 No.

31
512.06 --> 514.06
 No.

32
514.06 --> 526.39
 Stop it.

33
539.39 --> 541.39
 Stop it.

34
555.81 --> 557.81
 Stop it.

35
568.76 --> 572.76
 I can't persuade you.

36
572.76 --> 622.15
 No.

37
622.15 --> 624.15
 I can't persuade you.

38
628.68 --> 680.22
 You can hear me, can't you?

39
680.22 --> 732.58
 No.

40
732.58 --> 734.58
 Stop it.

41
785.00 --> 851.39
 What's wrong with you?

42
852.39 --> 854.39
 Stop it.

43
863.15 --> 866.15
 You're in a good condition, aren't you?

44
866.15 --> 873.30
 Stop it.

45
956.83 --> 958.83
 Stop it.

46
1321.63 --> 1323.63
 Stop it.

47
1327.29 --> 1330.29
 Remembered the taste of sex?

48
1330.29 --> 1376.51
 It depends on your wife, but we're not exposed.

49
1376.51 --> 1380.08
 Yes, yes.

50
1380.08 --> 1383.78
 My name is Kiyoto.

51
1383.78 --> 1387.66
 My wife's name?

52
1387.66 --> 1471.78
 Give me your name.

53
1471.78 --> 1473.78
 Shizuka.

54
1473.78 --> 1475.78
 Bye, Shizuka.

55
1475.78 --> 1478.78
 Remembered the taste of sex?
