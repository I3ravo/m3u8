1
11.76 --> 13.76
 Good work.

2
13.76 --> 14.76
 Good work.

3
14.76 --> 15.76
 Can I have your name?

4
15.76 --> 17.76
 Yes, I'm Kana Momonagi.

5
17.76 --> 18.76
 Nice to meet you.

6
18.76 --> 19.76
 Nice to meet you.

7
19.76 --> 20.76
 I'm glad you're here.

8
20.76 --> 22.76
 I hear the power of the sword fell down.

9
22.76 --> 24.76
 Thanks for taking a lot of pictures.

10
24.76 --> 27.76
 It's been seven years this year.

11
27.76 --> 28.76
 That's awesome.

12
28.76 --> 30.76
 Thank you.

13
30.76 --> 33.76
 It was a lot of fun.

14
33.76 --> 37.76
 He keeps saying really interesting things.

15
37.76 --> 42.76
 I thought I could release this as an AV.

16
42.76 --> 43.76
 Did something happen?

17
43.76 --> 44.76
 Did something happen?

18
44.76 --> 46.76
 No, it was just funny.

19
46.76 --> 48.76
 Oh, really. Thank you.

20
48.76 --> 54.76
 Today's plan was to stay with Emo-kun for a day.

21
54.76 --> 57.76
 I fell in love with him.

22
57.76 --> 63.76
 He was so cute, so I enjoyed Emo-kun's reaction.

23
63.76 --> 67.76
 But I think he's a bit of a coward.

24
67.76 --> 71.76
 Actually, I'm not good at things on the ground.

25
71.76 --> 74.76
 But I like to see men's reactions.

26
74.76 --> 76.76
 Maybe he doesn't like it.

27
76.76 --> 78.76
 But I want him to do more.

28
78.76 --> 81.76
 I want to push him to the limit.

29
84.76 --> 88.76
 I wanted to make him spit salt in the scene where he's weak.

30
88.76 --> 92.76
 But he left without a word.

31
92.76 --> 94.76
 I was like, what?

32
94.76 --> 96.76
 I couldn't enjoy it.

33
96.76 --> 98.76
 You bullied him for a day, didn't you?

34
98.76 --> 99.76
 Yeah, I did.

35
99.76 --> 101.76
 I was like, that's how it's going to be.

36
101.76 --> 103.76
 I didn't do anything special.

37
103.76 --> 104.76
 You didn't do anything special?

38
104.76 --> 105.76
 No, I didn't.

39
107.76 --> 109.76
 We had breakfast together.

40
109.76 --> 114.76
 I was so happy in that scene.

41
114.76 --> 119.76
 We hugged each other all the time.

42
119.76 --> 121.76
 We've changed a lot.

43
121.76 --> 123.76
 We eat delicious food.

44
123.76 --> 124.76
 I see.

45
124.76 --> 127.76
 I'm looking at your Twitter, but you're only talking about food.

46
127.76 --> 129.76
 It's almost all about food.

47
129.76 --> 132.76
 If you quit AV, you'll probably have a job as a cook, right?

48
132.76 --> 133.76
 That's right.

49
133.76 --> 136.76
 I'm going to be a food blogger.

50
136.76 --> 137.76
 I see.

51
137.76 --> 139.76
 You're going to make ramen with shaved ice, right?

52
139.76 --> 140.76
 Yes.

53
140.76 --> 141.76
 It's not ramen, it's Jiro.

54
141.76 --> 143.76
 Why are you so into Jiro?

55
143.76 --> 148.76
 When I joined the agency, the president took me there.

56
148.76 --> 154.76
 I'm not good at ramen, but I was told that Jiro was different.

57
154.76 --> 163.76
 When I ate it, I was moved by the taste of the noodles and the thickness of the pork.

58
163.76 --> 168.76
 Then I wanted to try various stores of Jiro.

59
168.76 --> 170.76
 So I ate all the stores.

60
170.76 --> 172.76
 How many stores are there?

61
172.76 --> 176.76
 There are 41 stores.

62
176.76 --> 177.76
 39?

63
177.76 --> 178.76
 It's not just Tokyo, is it?

64
178.76 --> 179.76
 It's not just Tokyo.

65
179.76 --> 185.76
 There are stores in Sapporo, Kyoto, Sendai, etc.

66
185.76 --> 190.76
 I'm not a big fan of that kind of thing.

67
190.76 --> 196.76
 But I like the brand of clothes called Pameo Pose.

68
196.76 --> 199.76
 I thought about it during this shoot.

69
199.76 --> 201.76
 I like people who have an interesting reaction.

70
201.76 --> 203.76
 I like people who are fun to be with.

71
203.76 --> 205.76
 What kind of person do you hate?

72
208.65 --> 210.65
 Someone like my manager.

73
210.65 --> 211.65
 What do you hate about your manager?

74
211.65 --> 213.65
 What do I hate about my manager?

75
213.65 --> 216.65
 I hate people who only talk about work.

76
216.65 --> 219.65
 That's why I have a lot of bad impressions.

77
219.65 --> 221.65
 I hate people who only think about profits.

78
224.65 --> 226.65
 I don't think it's good to be with them.

79
226.65 --> 227.65
 You're interested in jobs.

80
227.65 --> 228.65
 Yes.

81
229.65 --> 234.65
 My first experience was when I graduated from junior high school.

82
234.65 --> 238.65
 It was a spring break from the third week to the first day of high school.

83
238.65 --> 239.65
 Is that your boyfriend?

84
239.65 --> 240.65
 Yes.

85
240.65 --> 241.65
 We were dating.

86
241.65 --> 245.65
 It was the last time we went to different high schools.

87
245.65 --> 247.65
 So I don't have any experience.

88
247.65 --> 250.65
 I've only had normal sex.

89
251.65 --> 253.65
 I've only had sexual intercourse.

90
254.65 --> 255.65
 That's funny.

91
257.65 --> 262.65
 If I were to be reborn, I'd like to be a rich cat.

92
262.65 --> 263.65
 Which one?

93
263.65 --> 265.65
 I'd like to be a rich mother.

94
265.65 --> 268.65
 I'd like to be a gentle grandmother.

95
268.65 --> 270.65
 I'm an animal.

96
270.65 --> 273.65
 I'd like to be a gentle woman.

97
274.65 --> 277.65
 My dream is to be someone's wife.

98
277.65 --> 278.65
 Are you serious?

99
278.65 --> 280.65
 I'm serious.

100
280.65 --> 282.65
 I want to be a housewife.

101
282.65 --> 284.65
 I don't do housework.

102
284.65 --> 286.65
 This is my first work.

103
286.65 --> 293.65
 It's a work that I've never done before.

104
293.65 --> 299.65
 If you're rooting for me, you'll be able to enjoy it.

105
299.65 --> 307.65
 I talked about the back of the AV.

106
307.65 --> 313.65
 I hope you'll enjoy it.

107
313.65 --> 316.65
 I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

108
316.65 --> 318.65
 Thank you.

109
318.65 --> 320.65
 Thank you.

110
320.65 --> 322.65
 Thank you for your hard work.

111
322.65 --> 324.65
 Thank you for your hard work.

112
324.65 --> 326.65
 I'm sorry I'm late.

113
326.65 --> 328.65
 Thank you.

114
328.65 --> 344.16
 I'm meeting Kana.

115
344.16 --> 346.16
 She's a super celebrity.

116
346.16 --> 364.13
 I'm going to meet her.

117
364.13 --> 366.13
 I'm coming in.

118
381.11 --> 382.11
 Wow.

119
384.68 --> 386.68
 There's a lot of cameras.

120
387.68 --> 389.68
 Is this okay?

121
389.68 --> 391.68
 It's like this.

122
391.68 --> 394.68
 I've seen it before.

123
394.68 --> 398.68
 I'm glad to be on the show.

124
398.68 --> 400.68
 Is it okay?

125
402.68 --> 405.68
 I'm surprised at the number of cameras.

126
405.68 --> 411.68
 I'd like to stay with MO today.

127
412.68 --> 413.68
 I'll do my best.

128
414.68 --> 415.68
 I'll do my best.

129
416.68 --> 417.68
 It's a big place.

130
418.68 --> 425.77
 I'm looking forward to it.

131
430.74 --> 436.87
 I'm going to the front.

132
436.87 --> 438.87
 I'm going to the front.

133
439.87 --> 448.60
 Nice to meet you.

134
448.60 --> 449.60
 Nice to meet you.

135
449.60 --> 451.60
 I'm Kana Momodaki.

136
451.60 --> 453.60
 I've seen you before.

137
453.60 --> 455.60
 Have you seen me before?

138
455.60 --> 456.60
 I've seen you before.

139
456.60 --> 458.60
 Let's sit here.

140
458.60 --> 459.60
 Let's sit here.

141
462.60 --> 464.60
 I've seen you in a sample.

142
465.60 --> 467.60
 You've been on the show, haven't you?

143
467.60 --> 469.60
 Yes.

144
470.60 --> 472.60
 Why are you so nervous?

145
472.60 --> 474.60
 You're a famous person.

146
477.60 --> 480.60
 I was wondering what kind of MO you were.

147
480.60 --> 482.60
 I've seen you a lot.

148
482.60 --> 484.60
 I was relieved.

149
484.60 --> 485.60
 Really?

150
485.60 --> 486.60
 I'm glad.

151
486.60 --> 488.60
 Please sit down.

152
490.60 --> 493.60
 You've been on the show a lot, haven't you?

153
493.60 --> 495.60
 Yes.

154
495.60 --> 497.60
 You've been on the show a lot, haven't you?

155
497.60 --> 499.60
 I didn't know you at all.

156
499.60 --> 501.60
 This is the first time I've been on the show.

157
502.60 --> 504.60
 Why are you more nervous than me?

158
504.60 --> 505.60
 Why?

159
507.60 --> 508.60
 Aizawa?

160
510.60 --> 511.60
 You're cute.

161
512.60 --> 513.60
 Thank you.

162
515.60 --> 517.60
 You're MO, right?

163
517.60 --> 519.60
 I like being complimented.

164
521.60 --> 523.60
 You're always complimenting me.

165
524.60 --> 527.60
 You're always complimenting me in the sample video.

166
527.60 --> 529.60
 Can I do that much?

167
529.60 --> 531.60
 Please do it.

168
532.60 --> 534.60
 I want to do it.

169
535.60 --> 537.60
 I want you to do it.

170
538.60 --> 539.60
 I want you to do it.

171
541.60 --> 543.60
 I'm looking forward to it.

172
545.60 --> 547.60
 Are you a director?

173
547.60 --> 549.60
 Yes, I'm a director.

174
550.60 --> 552.60
 It's my first time.

175
552.60 --> 557.60
 I've never met you before, but I've seen you on SNS.

176
557.60 --> 560.60
 What kind of director are you?

177
560.60 --> 562.60
 I've met you many times.

178
563.60 --> 569.60
 You're famous for your recent works.

179
570.60 --> 573.60
 I'm very popular.

180
573.60 --> 575.60
 I think so, too.

181
575.60 --> 577.60
 I met you at once.

182
584.60 --> 586.60
 Are you okay?

183
586.60 --> 588.60
 You're still dating, right?

184
589.60 --> 591.60
 I'm not dating now, so it's okay.

185
592.60 --> 594.60
 It's all in the video.

186
595.60 --> 597.60
 I don't know.

187
597.60 --> 599.60
 I don't know.

188
600.60 --> 602.60
 Tell me clearly.

189
602.60 --> 604.60
 I don't know.

190
605.60 --> 607.60
 I don't know.

191
608.60 --> 610.60
 I think you're amazing.

192
610.60 --> 612.60
 You're amazing.

193
613.60 --> 615.60
 You say that a lot.

194
617.60 --> 619.60
 You don't have to do it.

195
620.60 --> 622.60
 I don't care if you get angry at me.

196
623.60 --> 625.60
 I can't defend myself.

197
625.60 --> 629.60
 I'm in a good mood when I praise you.

198
631.60 --> 633.60
 I'm not a bad person.

199
634.60 --> 636.60
 You're a kind person.

200
636.60 --> 638.60
 You're funny.

201
639.60 --> 641.60
 That's how we feel about each other.

202
642.60 --> 644.60
 Do you have anything to drink?

203
647.60 --> 649.60
 I don't know where it is.

204
649.60 --> 651.60
 Really?

205
651.60 --> 653.60
 I'll bring it.

206
654.60 --> 657.60
 You've been here a lot, haven't you?

207
660.60 --> 662.60
 I'm nervous.

208
665.62 --> 667.62
 I'm not nervous anymore.

209
669.62 --> 671.62
 What's in the drink?

210
673.62 --> 677.18
 Can I open it without permission?

211
678.18 --> 680.18
 Is it okay?

212
682.18 --> 685.18
 Aizawa opened it for me.

213
685.18 --> 687.18
 He opened it for me.

214
687.18 --> 689.18
 That's great.

215
691.18 --> 693.18
 Let's have a toast.

216
693.18 --> 695.18
 Let's have a toast.

217
695.18 --> 697.18
 That's great.

218
697.18 --> 699.18
 Luxurious.

219
699.18 --> 708.45
 Open it.

220
709.45 --> 711.45
 That's a great sound.

221
725.29 --> 729.62
 Thank you.

222
729.62 --> 731.62
 That's how it is.

223
740.91 --> 745.31
 What should I say?

224
745.31 --> 747.31
 What do you usually do?

225
750.31 --> 752.31
 I usually say cheers.

226
754.31 --> 756.31
 You're unreliable.

227
757.31 --> 763.90
 I'll say cheers when I meet you.

228
764.90 --> 766.90
 Cheers.

229
774.91 --> 776.91
 That's great.

230
785.02 --> 787.02
 I'll say cheers when I get drunk.

231
787.02 --> 789.02
 That's too soon.

232
789.02 --> 792.02
 Do I look like I like M?

233
794.02 --> 799.02
 I've never said that I like M.

234
800.02 --> 805.02
 I want to make him drink a lot.

235
806.02 --> 808.02
 Have you ever made him drink?

236
808.02 --> 809.02
 I have.

237
809.02 --> 811.02
 But I didn't let him drink much.

238
811.02 --> 813.02
 Can I do it today?

239
813.02 --> 815.02
 Can I do it?

240
816.02 --> 819.02
 I wanted to make him drink a lot.

241
819.02 --> 822.02
 But after that, everyone stops drinking.

242
822.02 --> 825.02
 I can't do it anymore.

243
825.02 --> 827.02
 So I want to do it more.

244
827.02 --> 829.02
 Is that so?

245
830.02 --> 833.02
 Actually, there is such a tendency.

246
833.02 --> 835.02
 Please do it.

247
835.02 --> 837.02
 Drink more.

248
837.02 --> 839.02
 When I drink?

249
840.02 --> 842.02
 When I drink a lot?

250
842.02 --> 844.02
 I see.

251
844.02 --> 846.02
 It's related.

252
847.02 --> 849.02
 Then, drink a lot.

253
850.02 --> 852.02
 Let's drink a lot.

254
858.11 --> 860.11
 There are a lot of things I've heard.

255
865.19 --> 867.19
 Thank you for saying that.

256
867.19 --> 869.19
 I love ramen.

257
869.19 --> 871.19
 Is that so?

258
871.19 --> 875.19
 I don't feel like I'm going to eat it at all.

259
876.19 --> 879.19
 But I can eat it at home.

260
879.19 --> 880.19
 Can you eat it?

261
880.19 --> 881.19
 Really?

262
881.19 --> 883.19
 Can you order it?

263
883.19 --> 884.19
 It's a food.

264
884.19 --> 886.19
 That's not fair.

265
886.19 --> 888.19
 Then, I can't go to my favorite ramen shop.

266
890.19 --> 892.19
 Isn't it hot?

267
892.19 --> 893.19
 It's very hot.

268
893.19 --> 895.19
 Isn't the sun too high?

269
895.19 --> 897.19
 It's hot.

270
900.19 --> 902.19
 Isn't it very hot?

271
902.19 --> 904.19
 It's easy to get drunk.

272
907.66 --> 909.66
 Drink a lot.

273
915.86 --> 918.86
 Are you drinking?

274
918.86 --> 920.86
 Are you getting drunk?

275
920.86 --> 922.86
 I'm drinking a lot.

276
922.86 --> 924.86
 It's getting warmer.

277
924.86 --> 926.86
 It's getting warmer.

278
927.86 --> 930.86
 Where do you like to be touched?

279
930.86 --> 932.86
 My neck.

280
932.86 --> 934.86
 Your neck?

281
934.86 --> 936.86
 It's hot.

282
936.86 --> 938.86
 It's hot.

283
940.86 --> 945.20
 You took off your top, didn't you?

284
945.20 --> 947.20
 I took off my top.

285
948.20 --> 950.20
 You can do it at any time.

286
952.20 --> 954.20
 I don't know.

287
960.65 --> 962.65
 Can you really eat it?

288
964.65 --> 966.65
 Are you eating with this body?

289
966.65 --> 968.65
 I'm eating with this body.

290
968.65 --> 973.11
 Fast.

291
983.64 --> 985.64
 Is it too fast?

292
985.64 --> 991.96
 It's too fast.

293
991.96 --> 993.96
 I want to talk to you more.

294
995.96 --> 1002.09
 I want to talk to you more.

295
1002.09 --> 1003.09
 What?

296
1003.09 --> 1005.09
 If you touch me.

297
1005.09 --> 1007.09
 I think it was too fast.

298
1007.09 --> 1009.09
 I touched you.

299
1009.09 --> 1011.09
 I touched you.

300
1013.09 --> 1015.09
 Do you want me to kiss you?

301
1023.69 --> 1025.69
 Are you all right?

302
1029.15 --> 1031.15
 Is your voice important?

303
1032.15 --> 1034.15
 Are you all right?

304
1034.15 --> 1036.15
 Are you all right?

305
1037.15 --> 1039.15
 It doesn't matter.

306
1039.15 --> 1044.15
 I think it's worse to say that to the director.

307
1046.15 --> 1048.15
 I don't care.

308
1055.26 --> 1057.26
 I'm looking forward to it.

309
1085.59 --> 1087.59
 It's too fast.

310
1087.59 --> 1089.59
 It's too fast.

311
1098.70 --> 1100.70
 What are you ordering?

312
1101.70 --> 1103.70
 What are you ordering?

313
1103.70 --> 1105.70
 It's a luxury.

314
1110.70 --> 1112.70
 That's right.

315
1117.14 --> 1119.14
 Do you order yourself?

316
1124.71 --> 1126.71
 You're too sloppy.

317
1126.71 --> 1133.35
 You're too sloppy.

318
1146.41 --> 1148.41
 Are you ordering again?

319
1180.59 --> 1182.59
 That's amazing.

320
1188.76 --> 1190.76
 You're still sloppy.

321
1217.22 --> 1219.22
 Don't do that.

322
1225.24 --> 1228.87
 Drink more.

323
1231.87 --> 1233.87
 I can't do it without touching you.

324
1239.21 --> 1241.21
 I want you to drink a lot.

325
1241.21 --> 1243.21
 Drink a lot.

326
1251.62 --> 1253.62
 Drink a lot.

327
1260.90 --> 1262.90
 I can't do it.

328
1263.90 --> 1265.90
 That's amazing.

329
1273.90 --> 1275.90
 I can't do it.

330
1278.90 --> 1289.12
 I can't do it.

331
1289.12 --> 1291.12
 I can't do it.

332
1295.65 --> 1297.65
 I can't do it.

333
1298.65 --> 1300.65
 You're too sloppy.

334
1300.65 --> 1302.65
 You like it, don't you?

335
1306.28 --> 1308.28
 I want you to do it directly.

336
1309.28 --> 1311.28
 Isn't it too fast?

337
1313.28 --> 1319.73
 I can't do it.

338
1321.73 --> 1323.73
 I can't do it.

339
1323.73 --> 1328.19
 You're too sloppy.

340
1328.19 --> 1330.19
 You're too sloppy.

341
1333.72 --> 1335.72
 Is this a late-night snack?

342
1335.72 --> 1337.72
 It's a late-night snack.

343
1337.72 --> 1339.72
 It's a late-night snack.

344
1339.72 --> 1341.72
 I'm going to do it.

345
1341.72 --> 1353.54
 I want you to do it directly.

346
1395.31 --> 1397.31
 I can't help it because I've met you.

347
1397.31 --> 1399.31
 I can't do it.

348
1401.31 --> 1403.31
 I can't do it.

349
1411.34 --> 1413.34
 There's a snack, too.

350
1414.34 --> 1416.34
 That's right.

351
1422.58 --> 1424.58
 What?

352
1425.58 --> 1427.58
 What?

353
1427.58 --> 1429.58
 Is this a snack?

354
1430.58 --> 1432.58
 What?

355
1432.58 --> 1434.58
 That's funny.

356
1435.58 --> 1437.58
 Then I'll have a snack.

357
1446.11 --> 1448.11
 Is this snack delicious?

358
1450.11 --> 1452.11
 Please taste it.

359
1460.09 --> 1462.09
 Does it feel good to stretch it?

360
1464.09 --> 1466.09
 Yes.

361
1470.17 --> 1472.17
 Does it feel good?

362
1472.17 --> 1474.17
 Yes.

363
1489.02 --> 1491.02
 Why are you holding back your voice?

364
1498.91 --> 1500.91
 You were holding back your voice.

365
1507.91 --> 1509.91
 You're funny.

366
1509.91 --> 1511.91
 Don't let go of me.

367
1511.91 --> 1513.91
 You're in the way.

368
1514.91 --> 1522.51
 Come here.

369
1536.03 --> 1538.03
 Does it feel good?

370
1539.03 --> 1541.03
 Let go of me.

371
1544.03 --> 1571.73
 Is it okay?

372
1571.73 --> 1573.73
 You're amazing.

373
1574.73 --> 1576.73
 Can you afford to think about that?

374
1579.73 --> 1581.73
 Can you afford to think about that?

375
1581.73 --> 1583.73
 No.

376
1583.73 --> 1585.73
 I can't afford it.

377
1603.17 --> 1605.17
 What are you doing?

378
1609.17 --> 1611.17
 I'm going to take it off.

379
1621.07 --> 1629.50
 Does it feel good?

380
1641.12 --> 1643.12
 Take it off.

381
1656.42 --> 1658.42
 Don't sleep.

382
1659.42 --> 1661.42
 Don't sleep, Najima.

383
1661.42 --> 1663.42
 Take it off.

384
1674.13 --> 1676.13
 Did you take it off?

385
1676.13 --> 1678.13
 Yes, I did.

386
1692.77 --> 1696.34
 You took it off.

387
1714.46 --> 1724.62
 You are enjoying by yourself.

388
1741.35 --> 1743.35
 Don't sleep.

389
1743.35 --> 1750.12
 Don't sleep.

390
1750.12 --> 1752.12
 Your body is so hot.

391
1761.26 --> 1764.77
 What's wrong?

392
1774.77 --> 1776.77
 Did you spill champagne?

393
1782.77 --> 1784.77
 Are you embarrassed?

394
1784.77 --> 1786.77
 You are so cute.

395
1788.77 --> 1790.77
 You just came out.

396
1790.77 --> 1792.77
 Aizawa-kun.

397
1802.77 --> 1804.77
 What is this?

398
1850.27 --> 1852.27
 I want you to drink it directly.

399
1852.27 --> 1854.27
 I want you to drink it directly.

400
1854.27 --> 1856.27
 You don't have to drink it.

401
1860.27 --> 1862.27
 Does it feel good?

402
1862.27 --> 1864.27
 Yes, it does.

403
1866.27 --> 1868.27
 Don't say that.

404
1868.27 --> 1870.27
 Please.

405
1884.51 --> 1886.51
 Please.

406
1886.51 --> 1888.51
 Thank you.

407
1894.51 --> 1900.70
 Can I look at it?

408
1900.70 --> 1904.85
 No.

409
1904.85 --> 1906.85
 Can I drink it?

410
1906.85 --> 1911.82
 Thank you.

411
1913.82 --> 1917.90
 Please drink it directly.

412
1919.90 --> 1921.90
 Please drink it directly.

413
1931.09 --> 1933.09
 I got it.

414
1956.13 --> 1958.13
 You spilled it.

415
1960.13 --> 1962.13
 You look like Hinode.

416
1972.43 --> 1974.43
 You look like Hinode.

417
1981.78 --> 1983.78
 You look like Hinode.

418
2013.98 --> 2015.98
 You just came out.

419
2054.85 --> 2056.85
 Does it feel good?

420
2056.85 --> 2088.19
 Yes, it does.

421
2111.49 --> 2113.49
 What are you doing?

422
2115.49 --> 2117.49
 Why are you running away?

423
2117.49 --> 2119.49
 You are cheating.

424
2121.49 --> 2123.49
 You are cheating.

425
2129.49 --> 2131.49
 Take it.

426
2131.49 --> 2135.06
 Take it with a spoon.

427
2135.06 --> 2137.06
 A spoon?

428
2137.06 --> 2139.06
 Yes.

429
2139.06 --> 2141.06
 Take it.

430
2141.06 --> 2143.06
 Take it with a spoon.

431
2143.06 --> 2145.06
 Take it with a spoon.

432
2145.06 --> 2147.06
 Is it taken?

433
2147.06 --> 2149.06
 Yes.

434
2299.30 --> 2304.14
 Show me your face.

435
2333.50 --> 2335.50
 Show me.

436
2335.50 --> 2341.54
 You are sucking it.

437
2347.17 --> 2353.87
 You are sucking it.

438
2353.87 --> 2355.87
 You are sucking it.

439
2355.87 --> 2357.87
 You just drank it.

440
2363.87 --> 2365.87
 Let me do it.

441
2373.31 --> 2375.31
 Let me do it.

442
2377.31 --> 2382.38
 Hey.

443
2382.38 --> 2392.35
 Hey.

444
2392.35 --> 2394.35
 Hey.

445
2394.35 --> 2397.79
 Show me.

446
2397.79 --> 2399.79
 Hey.

447
2399.79 --> 2401.79
 You should wipe it for me.

448
2405.17 --> 2407.17
 You are bad at it.

449
2407.17 --> 2412.02
 You are bad at it.

450
2414.02 --> 2416.02
 I will do it.

451
2416.02 --> 2418.02
 I will do it.

452
2420.02 --> 2422.02
 I will do it.

453
2422.02 --> 2424.02
 What?

454
2424.02 --> 2426.02
 No, I don't want to.

455
2426.02 --> 2428.02
 Come on, get on the bed.

456
2428.02 --> 2430.02
 One more time.

457
2432.02 --> 2440.06
 You can touch it.

458
2444.06 --> 2447.57
 Touch it.

459
2454.48 --> 2456.48
 Is it soft?

460
2458.48 --> 2460.48
 Touch it.

461
2464.48 --> 2466.48
 I just said it.

462
2468.48 --> 2470.48
 Take a break.

463
2474.48 --> 2476.48
 What are you talking about?

464
2476.48 --> 2478.48
 You like this, don't you?

465
2488.48 --> 2490.48
 Hey.

466
2490.48 --> 2492.48
 Look.

467
2494.48 --> 2496.48
 You like this, don't you?

468
2521.34 --> 2523.34
 What?

469
2523.34 --> 2525.34
 What?

470
2536.67 --> 2538.67
 You like this, don't you?

471
2542.67 --> 2544.67
 It's messed up.

472
2546.67 --> 2548.67
 Look at this.

473
2548.67 --> 2550.67
 I know.

474
2550.67 --> 2552.67
 It's not done yet.

475
2568.05 --> 2570.05
 Don't run away.

476
2572.05 --> 2574.05
 Don't run away.

477
2574.05 --> 2576.05
 Hey.

478
2580.05 --> 2582.05
 Why are you running away?

479
2582.05 --> 2584.05
 No, I'm not.

480
2584.05 --> 2586.05
 Let me see.

481
2599.81 --> 2601.81
 I want to see the toilet.

482
2607.81 --> 2609.81
 I haven't seen the toilet yet.

483
2613.81 --> 2615.81
 I just said it.

484
2615.81 --> 2617.81
 Don't stop me.

485
2621.81 --> 2623.81
 Do you want to go out?

486
2629.81 --> 2631.81
 Do you want to go out?

487
2631.81 --> 2633.81
 What?

488
2635.81 --> 2637.81
 What?

489
2639.81 --> 2641.81
 Hey.

490
2643.81 --> 2645.81
 Take a deep breath.

491
2654.83 --> 2656.83
 Don't you want to do it?

492
2656.83 --> 2664.24
 I want to do it.

493
2666.24 --> 2668.24
 Don't you want me to touch it?

494
2670.24 --> 2672.24
 I want you to do it.

495
2672.24 --> 2678.69
 Yes.

496
2678.69 --> 2687.82
 Turn around.

497
2694.86 --> 2702.91
 I'll let you touch it.

498
2702.91 --> 2704.91
 What's that reaction?

499
2714.11 --> 2716.11
 You're not a virgin, are you?

500
2716.11 --> 2718.11
 You're doing it, aren't you?

501
2720.11 --> 2722.11
 You look like a virgin.

502
2722.11 --> 2724.11
 I'm not a virgin.

503
2724.11 --> 2726.11
 Really?

504
2731.41 --> 2736.70
 What's that reaction?

505
2759.34 --> 2761.34
 Do you want to go out?

506
2761.34 --> 2763.34
 Do you want me to let you go out?

507
2765.34 --> 2779.79
 I'll let you lick me.

508
2784.19 --> 2795.31
 Are you licking me?

509
2799.31 --> 2801.31
 You like to be licked, don't you?

510
2801.31 --> 2803.31
 You like to be licked, don't you?

511
2803.31 --> 2807.46
 You like to be licked, don't you?

512
2850.61 --> 2852.61
 That's amazing.

513
2868.29 --> 2870.29
 You like to be licked, don't you?

514
2872.29 --> 2874.29
 You like to be licked, don't you?

515
2874.29 --> 2876.29
 You like to be licked, don't you?

516
2878.29 --> 2880.29
 I don't know what you're talking about.

517
2880.29 --> 2882.29
 You like to be licked, don't you?

518
2884.29 --> 2886.29
 Do your best to lick me.

519
2899.82 --> 2901.82
 I want you to feel good.

520
2911.36 --> 2913.36
 This side, too.

521
2918.67 --> 2926.59
 That's amazing.

522
2928.59 --> 2940.48
 What are you looking at?

523
2940.48 --> 2942.48
 You're not a virgin, are you?

524
2951.82 --> 2953.82
 Show me your tongue.

525
2953.82 --> 2955.82
 Show me your tongue.

526
2974.14 --> 2978.86
 You suck.

527
2982.37 --> 2984.37
 Does it hurt?

528
2988.45 --> 2990.45
 That's amazing.

529
2992.45 --> 2994.45
 You're not a virgin.

530
2996.45 --> 3004.30
 Lick me more.

531
3004.30 --> 3006.30
 That's amazing.

532
3023.36 --> 3027.89
 Lick me.

533
3042.03 --> 3044.03
 Lick me.

534
3059.02 --> 3061.02
 No, no, no.

535
3065.02 --> 3067.02
 You're so kind.

536
3069.02 --> 3073.49
 Did it hurt?

537
3073.49 --> 3075.49
 Did it hurt?

538
3075.49 --> 3077.49
 Let's put it in.

539
3082.85 --> 3084.85
 Do you want to sleep?

540
3084.85 --> 3088.48
 Let's sleep.

541
3088.48 --> 3090.48
 Get ready.

542
3094.48 --> 3096.48
 I'm not a virgin.

543
3096.48 --> 3101.01
 What do you mean?

544
3101.01 --> 3103.01
 Are you a virgin?

545
3103.01 --> 3105.01
 I'm not a virgin.

546
3109.01 --> 3111.01
 You're a virgin.

547
3111.01 --> 3113.01
 I'm a virgin.

548
3115.01 --> 3117.01
 I'm a virgin.

549
3119.01 --> 3121.01
 You'll get angry.

550
3126.51 --> 3128.51
 Wait a minute.

551
3128.51 --> 3130.51
 I'm a virgin.

552
3134.51 --> 3136.51
 How many times are you going to do this?

553
3136.51 --> 3138.51
 I'm a virgin.

554
3140.51 --> 3142.51
 Are you okay?

555
3142.51 --> 3144.51
 I'm okay.

556
3144.51 --> 3146.51
 You'll get angry.

557
3146.51 --> 3148.51
 I'm a troublemaker.

558
3148.51 --> 3150.51
 What are you choosing?

559
3152.51 --> 3154.51
 I'm a virgin.

560
3154.51 --> 3156.51
 Are you greedy?

561
3156.51 --> 3158.51
 Can you hold it?

562
3158.51 --> 3165.92
 I'll hold it.

563
3165.92 --> 3174.80
 Put it on.

564
3174.80 --> 3181.11
 If you don't put it on properly, I'll tell the people at the office.

565
3181.11 --> 3183.11
 That's right.

566
3183.11 --> 3185.11
 I'll be scolded.

567
3185.11 --> 3187.11
 I put it on properly.

568
3187.11 --> 3188.11
 Did you put it on?

569
3188.11 --> 3198.49
 I put it on.

570
3198.49 --> 3201.38
 I don't like it.

571
3217.97 --> 3219.97
 You're lying a lot.

572
3219.97 --> 3220.97
 You're confident, aren't you?

573
3220.97 --> 3222.97
 I'm confident.

574
3222.97 --> 3226.97
 That's great.

575
3239.54 --> 3240.54
 Does it feel good?

576
3240.54 --> 3242.54
 That's great.

577
3246.17 --> 3247.17
 That's great.

578
3250.67 --> 3252.67
 You look like you're having a hard time.

579
3260.69 --> 3263.69
 You're not tired yet, are you?

580
3266.69 --> 3268.69
 I'm a little tired.

581
3268.69 --> 3269.69
 Why?

582
3270.69 --> 3273.69
 You're so thin.

583
3282.69 --> 3285.69
 Why are you trying so hard?

584
3285.69 --> 3287.69
 I'm so thin.

585
3288.69 --> 3290.69
 You're thinner than I thought.

586
3290.69 --> 3291.69
 You're thinner than I thought.

587
3291.69 --> 3293.69
 You're thinner than I thought.

588
3293.69 --> 3294.69
 What's that?

589
3303.76 --> 3304.76
 You can do it.

590
3331.52 --> 3332.52
 While taking a picture.

591
3354.39 --> 3357.39
 What are you doing?

592
3357.39 --> 3359.39
 Are you told to take a picture?

593
3363.39 --> 3365.39
 You're taking it easy.

594
3368.39 --> 3370.39
 Are you taking a picture?

595
3379.02 --> 3381.02
 I'm taking a picture.

596
3381.02 --> 3382.02
 I'm taking a picture.

597
3382.02 --> 3384.02
 He can afford it.

598
3385.02 --> 3387.02
 You're annoying.

599
3398.41 --> 3401.41
 You're shaking the camera.

600
3417.76 --> 3422.61
 You can't stop it.

601
3426.24 --> 3453.70
 Take your time.

602
3457.70 --> 3459.70
 You can't take it off.

603
3464.70 --> 3466.70
 What are you thinking?

604
3466.70 --> 3468.70
 You're so confused.

605
3473.40 --> 3474.40
 From the back.

606
3495.74 --> 3497.74
 I want you to take a picture of me.

607
3499.74 --> 3501.74
 You're going to take a picture of me, aren't you?

608
3501.74 --> 3502.74
 I'm sorry.

609
3502.74 --> 3503.74
 I'm not banned.

610
3503.74 --> 3506.74
 You'll be scolded by the agency.

611
3506.74 --> 3508.74
 I'll give you energy.

612
3510.74 --> 3511.74
 Be careful.

613
3512.74 --> 3514.74
 Is it hard to understand?

614
3528.61 --> 3530.61
 Move yourself.

615
3542.74 --> 3544.74
 I can't say it.

616
3546.74 --> 3548.74
 Do your best.

617
3551.74 --> 3556.40
 Did you get it?

618
3558.40 --> 3569.84
 It's getting faster.

619
3575.48 --> 3576.48
 It's awkward.

620
3576.48 --> 3578.48
 It's awkward to move.

621
3579.48 --> 3581.48
 Do it faster.

622
3587.48 --> 3589.48
 You're bad.

623
3592.05 --> 3594.05
 You're bad.

624
3594.05 --> 3595.05
 You're bad.

625
3601.00 --> 3603.00
 You have to move properly.

626
3617.12 --> 3619.12
 Do your best.

627
3635.66 --> 3637.66
 How is it?

628
3638.66 --> 3639.66
 Do your best.

629
3639.66 --> 3640.66
 Keep going.

630
3659.48 --> 3661.48
 You're touching it first.

631
3667.89 --> 3669.89
 Are you moving properly?

632
3676.06 --> 3685.77
 Do you want me to move?

633
3686.77 --> 3688.77
 I'll do my best.

634
3689.77 --> 3702.62
 You're doing your best.

635
3718.33 --> 3747.84
 What?

636
3750.84 --> 3751.84
 What?

637
3752.84 --> 3753.84
 Did you get it?

638
3753.84 --> 3754.84
 I didn't get it.

639
3754.84 --> 3756.84
 I was surprised.

640
3756.84 --> 3757.84
 I didn't get it.

641
3757.84 --> 3758.84
 What?

642
3758.84 --> 3761.84
 I felt like I got it.

643
3761.84 --> 3762.84
 Did you get it?

644
3762.84 --> 3764.84
 I didn't get it.

645
3765.84 --> 3766.84
 You got it, right?

646
3766.84 --> 3767.84
 I didn't get it.

647
3768.84 --> 3769.84
 You're bad.

648
3771.84 --> 3772.84
 Don't move.

649
3773.84 --> 3774.84
 Don't move.

650
3776.84 --> 3777.84
 I didn't get it.

651
3778.84 --> 3779.84
 Let me do it.

652
3783.84 --> 3784.84
 You did it.

653
3789.84 --> 3790.84
 Move.

654
3791.84 --> 3796.39
 Wait.

655
3796.39 --> 3797.39
 I think I can do it.

656
3801.39 --> 3802.39
 You're moving fast.

657
3804.39 --> 3805.39
 Wait.

658
3805.39 --> 3806.39
 I think I can do it.

659
3810.39 --> 3811.39
 I'll do it.

660
3825.70 --> 3826.70
 You're moving fast.

661
3838.65 --> 3840.65
 Did you think I was a bad person?

662
3848.62 --> 3850.62
 What are you talking about?

663
3861.22 --> 3862.22
 I'll do it.

664
3868.22 --> 3869.22
 Put it on.

665
3873.55 --> 3874.55
 Put it on.

666
3881.85 --> 3882.85
 What are you doing?

667
3882.85 --> 3883.85
 What are you doing?

668
3884.85 --> 3886.85
 You're not supposed to put it on.

669
3887.85 --> 3889.85
 You're not supposed to put it on.

670
3898.67 --> 3899.67
 There's no break.

671
3900.67 --> 3902.67
 If you don't put it on, I'll go home.

672
3905.67 --> 3906.67
 I'll put it on.

673
3906.67 --> 3907.67
 Put it on.

674
3911.43 --> 3912.43
 Hurry up.

675
3913.43 --> 3914.43
 Did you put it on?

676
3914.43 --> 3915.43
 Did you put it on?

677
3915.43 --> 3916.43
 Did you put it on?

678
3916.43 --> 3917.43
 I did.

679
3917.43 --> 3918.43
 I put it on.

680
3941.46 --> 3942.46
 I'll do it.

681
3942.46 --> 3943.46
 Why?

682
3945.46 --> 3946.46
 You're bad.

683
3948.46 --> 3949.46
 You said something weird.

684
3952.46 --> 3953.46
 You're apologizing.

685
3953.46 --> 3954.46
 Why?

686
3954.46 --> 3955.46
 Why are you apologizing?

687
3955.46 --> 3956.46
 I'm sorry.

688
3957.46 --> 3958.46
 I'll do it.

689
3958.46 --> 3959.46
 Why?

690
3960.46 --> 3961.46
 I'll do it.

691
3962.46 --> 3963.46
 I'll do it.

692
3963.46 --> 3964.46
 You're going to be stupid.

693
3964.46 --> 3965.46
 I'm stupid.

694
3966.46 --> 3967.46
 You should be stupid.

695
3969.46 --> 3970.46
 Show me that you're stupid.

696
3987.88 --> 3988.88
 You're already stupid.

697
3990.88 --> 3991.88
 You're already stupid.

698
3992.88 --> 3993.88
 Not at all.

699
3994.88 --> 3995.88
 I can be more stupid.

700
3995.88 --> 3996.88
 More?

701
3996.88 --> 3997.88
 I can be more stupid.

702
3999.88 --> 4000.88
 That's not true.

703
4001.88 --> 4019.40
 You can go inside, can't you?

704
4019.40 --> 4029.18
 Yes, I can.

705
4036.26 --> 4039.70
 Oh, I see.

706
4039.70 --> 4041.70
 I see.

707
4041.70 --> 4043.70
 What?

708
4043.70 --> 4045.70
 Well...

709
4045.70 --> 4051.54
 You want to take a break as soon as I let you out.

710
4051.54 --> 4053.54
 No, no, no.

711
4053.54 --> 4058.33
 No, no, no, no, no.

712
4058.33 --> 4060.33
 No, no, no, no, no.

713
4060.33 --> 4062.33
 This way.

714
4065.33 --> 4069.02
 Hey.

715
4069.02 --> 4072.91
 It's on the bed.

716
4072.91 --> 4091.26
 Oh.

717
4091.26 --> 4106.80
 What are you doing?

718
4107.80 --> 4112.01
 Slowly.

719
4112.01 --> 4114.01
 You are clumsy.

720
4114.01 --> 4116.01
 You are clumsy.

721
4116.01 --> 4132.31
 You are clumsy.

722
4132.31 --> 4134.31
 You are so clumsy.

723
4134.31 --> 4136.31
 I see.

724
4143.74 --> 4148.08
 Do your best.

725
4148.08 --> 4165.98
 Oh.

726
4165.98 --> 4167.98
 Oh.

727
4167.98 --> 4169.98
 You are clumsy.

728
4170.98 --> 4172.98
 Oh.

729
4172.98 --> 4174.98
 Oh, it feels good.

730
4174.98 --> 4176.98
 Do your best.

731
4176.98 --> 4182.66
 Oh.

732
4183.66 --> 4185.66
 Oh.

733
4185.66 --> 4187.66
 Oh.

734
4187.66 --> 4189.66
 You are going to fall asleep.

735
4189.66 --> 4191.66
 Hey.

736
4191.66 --> 4193.66
 You are going to fall asleep.

737
4193.66 --> 4195.66
 I'm going to fall asleep.

738
4197.66 --> 4199.66
 Don't fall asleep.

739
4200.66 --> 4203.66
 I'm always listening to your hard-pitch.

740
4206.66 --> 4208.66
 Do your best.

741
4208.66 --> 4210.66
 Aizawa-kun.

742
4210.66 --> 4212.66
 You can do it, right?

743
4214.66 --> 4216.66
 Why are you moving like this?

744
4216.66 --> 4218.66
 Do your best.

745
4218.66 --> 4220.66
 Let's aim to be a good actor.

746
4220.66 --> 4222.66
 I'm going to fall asleep if I do my best.

747
4223.66 --> 4225.66
 Do your best.

748
4226.66 --> 4228.66
 Do your best.

749
4228.66 --> 4230.66
 Do your best.

750
4230.66 --> 4232.66
 You can be a good actor.

751
4240.70 --> 4242.70
 You are amazing.

752
4242.70 --> 4244.70
 You can be a good actor.

753
4244.70 --> 4246.70
 Do you want to be a good actor?

754
4246.70 --> 4248.70
 Yes.

755
4253.70 --> 4255.70
 More.

756
4255.70 --> 4257.70
 Give me a harder one.

757
4259.70 --> 4263.33
 Are you tired?

758
4263.33 --> 4265.33
 I'm sorry.

759
4267.33 --> 4271.92
 Do your best.

760
4274.92 --> 4276.92
 Do your best.

761
4277.92 --> 4279.92
 That's right.

762
4279.92 --> 4281.92
 Oh.

763
4281.92 --> 4283.92
 That's right.

764
4283.92 --> 4285.92
 Do your best until I go.

765
4289.68 --> 4291.68
 Wait a minute.

766
4291.68 --> 4293.68
 I'm not waiting.

767
4293.68 --> 4295.68
 Wait a minute.

768
4296.68 --> 4298.68
 I'm not waiting.

769
4300.68 --> 4302.68
 I'm sorry.

770
4302.68 --> 4304.68
 That's right.

771
4309.68 --> 4311.68
 No.

772
4312.68 --> 4314.68
 You can't do it yet.

773
4314.68 --> 4316.68
 You can't do it yet.

774
4316.68 --> 4318.68
 You can't do it yet.

775
4318.68 --> 4320.68
 You can't do it yet.

776
4321.68 --> 4323.68
 No.

777
4323.68 --> 4325.68
 No.

778
4325.68 --> 4327.68
 Wait a minute.

779
4328.68 --> 4330.68
 Hey.

780
4332.68 --> 4334.68
 Wait a minute.

781
4336.68 --> 4340.50
 No.

782
4341.50 --> 4346.10
 What?

783
4346.10 --> 4348.10
 What?

784
4350.41 --> 4352.41
 You are amazing.

785
4356.41 --> 4358.41
 I couldn't stand it.

786
4360.41 --> 4362.41
 I couldn't stand it.

787
4363.41 --> 4365.41
 Take off the tissue.

788
4365.41 --> 4367.41
 Take off the tissue.

789
4369.41 --> 4371.41
 I'm putting it on your chest.

790
4377.41 --> 4379.41
 Why are you taking it off?

791
4383.41 --> 4385.41
 Don't take it off.

792
4386.41 --> 4388.41
 It's not there.

793
4390.41 --> 4392.41
 Don't get carried away.

794
4392.41 --> 4394.41
 Don't get carried away.

795
4394.41 --> 4396.41
 It's not there.

796
4396.41 --> 4398.41
 You want me to go, don't you?

797
4398.41 --> 4400.41
 You want me to go, don't you?

798
4406.41 --> 4408.41
 You wanted me to go, didn't you?

799
4410.41 --> 4412.41
 Were you happy that a lot of it came out?

800
4412.41 --> 4414.41
 Did you want to take it?

801
4414.41 --> 4416.41
 Did you want to take a lot of it?

802
4417.41 --> 4419.41
 Are you happy?

803
4424.41 --> 4426.41
 Don't be too excited.

804
4426.41 --> 4428.41
 You can't do it.

805
4428.41 --> 4430.41
 If you pick it up on the third try, I hope that a lot of it will come out.

806
4430.41 --> 4432.41
 If you pick it up on the third try, I hope that a lot will come out.

807
4434.41 --> 4436.41
 That's not it.

808
4446.36 --> 4448.36
 Let's do it for the fourth time.

809
4449.36 --> 4450.36
 Do you want to do your best?

810
4451.36 --> 4453.36
 I think I can do my best next time.

811
4457.36 --> 4458.36
 Let's do our best for the fourth time.

812
4468.36 --> 4470.36
 Let's do our best next time.

813
4471.36 --> 4472.36
 Let's take a break.

814
4476.36 --> 4483.36
 You have to go after I say.

815
4484.36 --> 4485.36
 Do your best.

816
4487.36 --> 4488.36
 Please take a break.

817
4489.36 --> 4491.36
 You said you would do your best.

818
4492.36 --> 4494.36
 I want to do my best for the fourth time.

819
4495.36 --> 4496.36
 It doesn't matter.

820
4497.36 --> 4498.36
 Do your best.

821
4499.36 --> 4500.36
 You will be promoted.

822
4500.36 --> 4501.36
 Don't be angry.

823
4506.12 --> 4510.56
 I can't do my best.

824
4511.56 --> 4514.56
 You said you would do your best for the fourth time.

825
4515.56 --> 4517.56
 I don't evaluate myself.

826
4521.56 --> 4522.56
 Don't be so serious.

827
4524.56 --> 4544.37
 You were happy when you were in the bath, right?

828
4709.48 --> 4711.48
 I was happy.

829
4712.48 --> 4714.48
 You are wrong.

830
4720.22 --> 4727.43
 You said you would do your best.

831
4728.43 --> 4729.43
 I'm sorry.

832
4730.43 --> 4731.43
 I'm sorry.

833
4732.43 --> 4733.43
 Did you say that?

834
4734.43 --> 4735.43
 Did you say that?

835
4742.09 --> 4743.09
 I'll do my best next time.

836
4744.09 --> 4746.09
 Can I do my best next time?

837
4785.78 --> 4786.78
 I'm sorry.

838
4797.94 --> 4798.94
 I don't want to do it.

839
4805.10 --> 4806.10
 Let's do it.

840
4815.10 --> 4816.10
 I don't want to do it.

841
4818.10 --> 4819.10
 I don't want to do it.

842
4824.86 --> 4832.74
 I'm sorry.

843
4832.74 --> 4834.74
 You're doing it again.

844
4834.74 --> 4836.74
 I'm sorry.

845
4836.74 --> 4838.74
 See?

846
4838.74 --> 4840.74
 It came out.

847
4840.74 --> 4842.74
 You don't take it off?

848
4842.74 --> 4844.74
 It's okay.

849
4844.74 --> 4846.74
 You're not good at it.

850
4848.74 --> 4850.74
 I'm sorry.

851
4854.74 --> 4859.46
 Can you wash it?

852
4859.46 --> 4861.46
 I can.

853
4863.46 --> 4865.46
 Do you want me to heat it up more?

854
4897.85 --> 4899.85
 It's not enough.

855
4899.85 --> 4901.85
 I'll take a break.

856
4901.85 --> 4903.85
 Did you take a break?

857
4903.85 --> 4905.85
 You took a break, didn't you?

858
4905.85 --> 4907.85
 You took a break, didn't you?

859
4907.85 --> 4909.85
 It's still coming out.

860
4914.38 --> 4922.04
 How many minutes are left?

861
4966.25 --> 4968.25
 Let's have a toast.

862
4968.25 --> 4984.36
 Cheers.

863
4984.36 --> 4986.36
 You're hungry, aren't you?

864
4986.36 --> 4988.36
 Yes, I am.

865
4992.36 --> 4994.36
 I opened the lid of sake.

866
4996.36 --> 4998.36
 It's still not enough.

867
5000.36 --> 5002.36
 It's not enough at all.

868
5002.36 --> 5004.36
 It's not enough overall.

869
5004.36 --> 5006.36
 I'm running out of snacks.

870
5006.36 --> 5008.36
 Let's go shopping.

871
5008.36 --> 5010.36
 Is it near here?

872
5010.36 --> 5012.36
 Yes, it's near the convenience store.

873
5012.36 --> 5014.36
 Let's go to the convenience store.

874
5014.36 --> 5016.36
 Let's go.

875
5016.36 --> 5018.36
 You know where to go.

876
5020.36 --> 5022.36
 Did you bring it?

877
5022.36 --> 5024.36
 Yes, I did.

878
5024.36 --> 5026.36
 Do you want to eat ice cream?

879
5026.36 --> 5028.36
 Yes, I do.

880
5028.36 --> 5030.36
 Is there a park on the way home?

881
5030.36 --> 5032.36
 Yes, there is.

882
5032.36 --> 5034.36
 Let's eat ice cream there.

883
5034.36 --> 5036.36
 Ice cream?

884
5036.36 --> 5038.36
 Let's go.

885
5094.12 --> 5096.12
 I wonder what flavor the ice cream is.

886
5098.12 --> 5100.12
 It's wet.

887
5100.12 --> 5106.12
 In this season,

888
5106.12 --> 5108.12
 I wonder if there are sweet potatoes.

889
5110.12 --> 5112.12
 Is there pears?

890
5112.12 --> 5114.12
 Is there La France?

891
5114.12 --> 5116.12
 It's good.

892
5116.12 --> 5118.12
 I hope there is.

893
5118.12 --> 5120.12
 Gari Gari-kun is also good.

894
5120.12 --> 5122.12
 I'll power up my ice cream.

895
5124.12 --> 5126.12
 Mango?

896
5126.12 --> 5128.12
 It's not a banana.

897
5128.12 --> 5130.12
 Both are good.

898
5130.12 --> 5132.12
 Both are good.

899
5132.12 --> 5134.12
 It's in the banana shake.

900
5134.12 --> 5136.12
 It's good, isn't it?

901
5136.12 --> 5138.12
 It's not a banana.

902
5142.26 --> 5156.20
 There is a mango.

903
5156.20 --> 5158.20
 There is a mango.

904
5158.20 --> 5161.70
 There is a corn, too.

905
5161.70 --> 5163.70
 I've never seen it before.

906
5165.70 --> 5167.70
 There is a peach.

907
5167.70 --> 5169.70
 There is a peach, but I want to eat a corn.

908
5169.70 --> 5171.70
 You can buy a lot of it.

909
5171.70 --> 5173.70
 Do you want it?

910
5175.70 --> 5177.70
 Human grilled vegetables.

911
5181.70 --> 5183.70
 Do you want to eat it?

912
5195.51 --> 5197.51
 You look like you don't have anything.

913
5199.51 --> 5201.51
 It looks good.

914
5205.27 --> 5217.35
 What are you doing?

915
5230.54 --> 5232.54
 There is a chicken.

916
5247.13 --> 5251.14
 There is a chicken, too.

917
5251.14 --> 5256.18
 Thank you.

918
5258.18 --> 5260.18
 You didn't notice it.

919
5264.18 --> 5266.18
 There was a camera.

920
5266.18 --> 5268.18
 There was a camera on the roof.

921
5268.18 --> 5270.18
 It's a dangerous guest.

922
5270.18 --> 5272.18
 I'm hungry.

923
5279.59 --> 5281.59
 Let's have a toast in the park.

924
5289.61 --> 5291.61
 Let's have a toast.

925
5294.92 --> 5296.92
 Is it heavy?

926
5296.92 --> 5298.92
 It was quite heavy.

927
5306.97 --> 5308.97
 Are you okay?

928
5310.97 --> 5312.97
 I'm sorry.

929
5336.01 --> 5338.01
 Do you want to eat this?

930
5340.01 --> 5342.01
 It's a corn.

931
5344.01 --> 5346.01
 Is it heavy?

932
5346.01 --> 5348.01
 Do you want to eat it?

933
5348.01 --> 5350.01
 Do you want to eat it first?

934
5354.01 --> 5356.01
 Why do you eat it?

935
5360.47 --> 5362.47
 How does it taste?

936
5362.47 --> 5364.47
 It tastes like corn.

937
5364.47 --> 5366.47
 Is it light?

938
5366.47 --> 5370.23
 Let me eat it.

939
5381.02 --> 5383.02
 It's a corn.

940
5383.02 --> 5385.02
 It's good.

941
5385.02 --> 5387.02
 It tastes like sugar.

942
5387.02 --> 5390.52
 It's sweet.

943
5392.52 --> 5394.52
 Do you want to eat it first?

944
5396.52 --> 5398.52
 Do you want to eat it first?

945
5400.52 --> 5402.52
 Let me eat it.

946
5402.52 --> 5404.52
 It's still hard.

947
5404.52 --> 5406.52
 Eat it in one bite.

948
5412.52 --> 5422.04
 Is it good?

949
5424.04 --> 5426.04
 There is a bean paste inside.

950
5426.04 --> 5428.04
 There is a bean paste inside.

951
5428.04 --> 5430.04
 We haven't got there yet.

952
5434.04 --> 5436.04
 We want to get there.

953
5447.29 --> 5449.29
 It's good.

954
5453.29 --> 5455.29
 I'm curious about the taste.

955
5455.29 --> 5457.29
 It's sweet.

956
5459.29 --> 5461.29
 I'm hungry.

957
5463.29 --> 5465.29
 It's good.

958
5465.29 --> 5467.29
 Let's make a toast.

959
5480.07 --> 5487.48
 Cheers.

960
5489.48 --> 5491.48
 It's good to drink outside.

961
5491.48 --> 5495.37
 It's quiet.

962
5495.37 --> 5499.70
 There is no one here.

963
5499.70 --> 5503.53
 I don't think so.

964
5506.90 --> 5508.90
 We are going outside.

965
5508.90 --> 5510.90
 Do you want me to tell you a story?

966
5512.90 --> 5514.90
 You don't have to tell me.

967
5514.90 --> 5516.90
 I'm excited to go outside.

968
5538.89 --> 5540.89
 Do you want to taste the ice cream?

969
5540.89 --> 5542.89
 Do you want to taste the ice cream?

970
5544.89 --> 5546.89
 I'm a scary person.

971
5548.89 --> 5550.89
 I'm a scary person.

972
5552.89 --> 5554.89
 What are you into these days?

973
5560.89 --> 5562.89
 K-POP

974
5566.89 --> 5568.89
 I see.

975
5568.89 --> 5570.89
 What do you like?

976
5570.89 --> 5572.89
 I'm going to sing.

977
5572.89 --> 5574.89
 Why?

978
5574.89 --> 5576.89
 You like it.

979
5578.89 --> 5580.89
 What do you like?

980
5580.89 --> 5582.89
 I like TT.

981
5584.89 --> 5586.89
 Do it more rhythmically.

982
5588.89 --> 5590.89
 TT.

983
5590.89 --> 5592.89
 It's wrong.

984
5592.89 --> 5594.89
 You are making fun of me.

985
5596.89 --> 5598.89
 TT means sad.

986
5602.89 --> 5604.89
 Do TT now.

987
5604.89 --> 5606.89
 TT.

988
5608.89 --> 5610.89
 You are in a good mood.

989
5614.89 --> 5616.89
 Are you going to cry?

990
5616.89 --> 5618.89
 I'm going to cry.

991
5628.17 --> 5630.17
 I'm going to cry.

992
5630.17 --> 5632.17
 I'm going to cry.

993
5634.17 --> 5636.17
 Why are you tired?

994
5638.17 --> 5640.17
 Are you tired of TT?

995
5640.17 --> 5642.17
 It's getting cold.

996
5642.17 --> 5644.17
 It's getting cold.

997
5650.50 --> 5652.50
 Let's go.

998
5652.50 --> 5658.50
 It's beautiful.

999
5660.50 --> 5662.50
 You are suddenly romantic.

1000
5664.50 --> 5666.50
 It's beautiful.

1001
5666.50 --> 5684.09
 It's cold.

1002
5684.09 --> 5686.09
 Let's go home and continue.

1003
5691.32 --> 5693.32
 No one was here.

1004
5693.32 --> 5695.32
 It's dark.

1005
5695.32 --> 5697.32
 It's okay.

1006
5699.32 --> 5701.32
 Please open the door.

1007
5707.83 --> 5713.13
 Please let me in.

1008
5715.13 --> 5725.93
 I'm home.

1009
5735.77 --> 5737.77
 It's warm.

1010
5737.77 --> 5746.90
 I drank a lot.

1011
5752.34 --> 5757.26
 I'm full.

1012
5757.26 --> 5759.26
 I'm sleepy.

1013
5768.87 --> 5770.87
 Are you going to bed?

1014
5770.87 --> 5772.87
 Are you going to sleep?

1015
5780.57 --> 5785.29
 Do you go to bed?

1016
5791.16 --> 5793.16
 Take off your socks.

1017
5793.16 --> 5805.27
 I have to clean it up or he'll get mad at me.

1018
5810.67 --> 5817.63
 Give it to me.

1019
5820.63 --> 5822.63
 I'm sleepy.

1020
5830.57 --> 5832.57
 Good night.

1021
5833.57 --> 5864.27
 Hurry up.

1022
5866.27 --> 5882.64
 Good night.

1023
5888.98 --> 5890.98
 Good night.

1024
5892.98 --> 5894.98
 Good night.

1025
5900.25 --> 5902.25
 Are you sleepy?

1026
5925.53 --> 5927.53
 Are you sleepy?

1027
5939.42 --> 5941.42
 Are you going to sleep?

1028
5941.42 --> 5944.92
 Don't do that.

1029
5951.92 --> 5953.92
 Don't do that.

1030
5975.23 --> 5977.23
 Good night.

1031
5979.23 --> 5981.23
 I won't let you sleep tonight.

1032
5982.23 --> 5984.23
 I won't let you sleep.

1033
6091.22 --> 6108.04
 I changed my clothes.

1034
6111.04 --> 6114.04
 I'm going to wake him up.

1035
6149.86 --> 6151.86
 I'm going to wake him up.

1036
6152.86 --> 6154.86
 I'm going to wake him up.

1037
6158.86 --> 6160.86
 Take it off.

1038
6161.86 --> 6163.86
 Take it off, please.

1039
6166.86 --> 6169.86
 He hasn't woken up at all.

1040
6173.86 --> 6175.86
 He's wearing a cute outfit.

1041
6203.10 --> 6205.10
 Don't do that.

1042
6213.10 --> 6215.10
 Are you going to take this out?

1043
6221.10 --> 6227.04
 Take it out.

1044
6238.86 --> 6240.86
 Hey.

1045
6241.86 --> 6243.86
 I told you I wanted you to wipe the salt.

1046
6243.86 --> 6245.86
 But you're too slow.

1047
6247.86 --> 6249.86
 You're too fast.

1048
6253.86 --> 6255.86
 I can't help it.

1049
6257.86 --> 6259.86
 You're not going to take it out?

1050
6259.86 --> 6261.86
 Are you still going to take it out?

1051
6262.86 --> 6267.14
 I'm going to take it out.

1052
6268.14 --> 6270.14
 Take it out.

1053
6286.91 --> 6288.91
 I didn't do anything.

1054
6288.91 --> 6290.91
 I was surprised.

1055
6290.91 --> 6292.91
 Are you surprised?

1056
6295.91 --> 6298.91
 It was amazing to wipe the salt.

1057
6299.91 --> 6301.91
 You're too fast.

1058
6305.91 --> 6307.91
 You didn't see anything, did you?

1059
6307.91 --> 6309.91
 I didn't see anything.

1060
6309.91 --> 6311.91
 Look at me.

1061
6311.91 --> 6313.91
 I'm wearing a cute outfit.

1062
6313.91 --> 6315.91
 That's right.

1063
6318.91 --> 6320.91
 Are you still going to stand up?

1064
6321.91 --> 6323.91
 Are you going to stand up?

1065
6323.91 --> 6325.91
 I wiped the salt.

1066
6326.91 --> 6328.91
 You're too slow.

1067
6328.91 --> 6330.91
 You're too slow.

1068
6335.91 --> 6337.91
 You're too slow.

1069
6339.91 --> 6341.91
 I'm sorry.

1070
6341.91 --> 6343.91
 I'm sorry.

1071
6344.91 --> 6346.91
 It's cute.

1072
6346.91 --> 6348.91
 Okay.

1073
6348.91 --> 6350.91
 Take that out.

1074
6350.91 --> 6352.91
 It's a toy.

1075
6352.91 --> 6356.42
 There's salt in there.

1076
6360.43 --> 6365.64
 I couldn't enjoy it at all.

1077
6365.64 --> 6369.08
 I can't enjoy it alone.

1078
6377.90 --> 6379.90
 It's wet.

1079
6379.90 --> 6381.90
 I'm sorry.

1080
6385.90 --> 6389.78
 Can you take it out?

1081
6389.78 --> 6395.66
 Yes, I can.

1082
6399.35 --> 6401.35
 You're going to wipe the salt.

1083
6401.35 --> 6403.35
 I'm sorry.

1084
6409.93 --> 6411.93
 It feels good.

1085
6437.28 --> 6442.51
 How do you feel?

1086
6442.51 --> 6444.51
 Are you in Kenjan mode?

1087
6460.52 --> 6462.52
 I couldn't enjoy it at all.

1088
6462.52 --> 6465.96
 I can't enjoy it alone.

1089
6474.51 --> 6476.51
 It's wet.

1090
6476.51 --> 6478.51
 It feels good.

1091
6489.34 --> 6491.34
 It feels good.

1092
6504.62 --> 6506.62
 Oh, no.

1093
6515.18 --> 6542.36
 I'm going to wipe the salt with a toy.

1094
6550.60 --> 6552.60
 It feels good.

1095
6553.60 --> 6555.60
 Does it feel good?

1096
6556.60 --> 6558.60
 That's Kenjan mode.

1097
6558.60 --> 6560.60
 That's Kenjan mode.

1098
6563.60 --> 6566.60
 I was in Kenjan mode at the end.

1099
6569.60 --> 6579.12
 Oh, no.

1100
6581.12 --> 6583.12
 I'm going to wipe the salt.

1101
6584.12 --> 6608.49
 I knew it.

1102
6608.49 --> 6619.00
 I wiped the salt.

1103
6619.00 --> 6621.00
 It felt good.

1104
6621.00 --> 6623.00
 I wiped the salt alone.

1105
6623.00 --> 6625.00
 Whose fault is it?

1106
6626.00 --> 6628.00
 It's Aizawa's.

1107
6628.00 --> 6630.00
 It's Aizawa's fault.

1108
6632.00 --> 6634.00
 Can you stand up?

1109
6636.00 --> 6638.00
 I want to put the salt in your mouth.

1110
6646.00 --> 6649.76
 Can you stand up?

1111
6649.76 --> 6651.76
 You can stand up, right?

1112
6651.76 --> 6653.76
 You can stand up, right?

1113
6654.76 --> 6659.29
 I'm sorry.

1114
6661.29 --> 6676.84
 I can't believe that I made a girl do it alone.

1115
6677.84 --> 6679.84
 I'm sorry.

1116
6679.84 --> 6681.84
 I didn't mean to.

1117
6720.88 --> 6735.49
 Oh, no.

1118
6738.49 --> 6740.49
 Oh, no.

1119
6741.49 --> 6743.49
 You can stand up, right?

1120
6762.58 --> 6764.58
 Put on the rubber band.

1121
6812.82 --> 6814.82
 What's impossible?

1122
6815.82 --> 6817.82
 Oh, no.

1123
6819.82 --> 6821.82
 Don't wipe the salt alone.

1124
6826.82 --> 6828.82
 Oh, no.

1125
6829.82 --> 6831.82
 I'm going to die.

1126
6831.82 --> 6833.82
 What?

1127
6833.82 --> 6835.82
 I'm going to die.

1128
6835.82 --> 6837.82
 I'm not going to die.

1129
6839.82 --> 6841.82
 Oh, no.

1130
6841.82 --> 6843.82
 Oh, no.

1131
6843.82 --> 6845.82
 What's wrong?

1132
6845.82 --> 6847.82
 What's wrong?

1133
6969.60 --> 6978.67
 Get up.

1134
6978.67 --> 6980.67
 Aizawa, get up.

1135
6995.38 --> 6997.38
 It's morning.

1136
6997.38 --> 6999.38
 I can't open my eyes.

1137
7001.38 --> 7004.82
 Good morning.

1138
7006.82 --> 7008.82
 Are you sleepy?

1139
7008.82 --> 7010.82
 It's morning.

1140
7012.82 --> 7014.82
 It's morning.

1141
7014.82 --> 7016.82
 It's morning.

1142
7024.80 --> 7027.80
 If you're sleepy, you can sleep a little longer.

1143
7032.80 --> 7035.80
 You can sleep as you like.

1144
7046.25 --> 7048.25
 Are you awake?

1145
7050.25 --> 7052.25
 You're awake.

1146
7069.38 --> 7074.36
 Oh, no.

1147
7078.36 --> 7080.36
 Good morning.

1148
7080.36 --> 7082.36
 Good morning.

1149
7082.36 --> 7084.36
 Are you awake?

1150
7084.36 --> 7086.36
 I'm awake.

1151
7089.06 --> 7091.06
 Oh, no.

1152
7091.06 --> 7093.06
 Oh, no.

1153
7096.43 --> 7098.43
 It feels like it's morning.

1154
7098.43 --> 7100.43
 It's morning.

1155
7100.43 --> 7102.43
 Are you awake?

1156
7102.43 --> 7105.94
 I'm awake.

1157
7121.38 --> 7123.38
 What's wrong?

1158
7123.38 --> 7125.38
 What's wrong?

1159
7140.23 --> 7143.23
 It's a waste of time if you don't feel good.

1160
7165.00 --> 7167.00
 Oh, no.

1161
7167.00 --> 7169.00
 Oh, no.

1162
7169.00 --> 7171.00
 Oh, no?

1163
7171.00 --> 7173.00
 Oh, no.

1164
7173.00 --> 7175.00
 Oh, no.

1165
7175.00 --> 7177.00
 Here?

1166
7180.00 --> 7182.00
 Oh, it feels good.

1167
7182.00 --> 7195.62
 Does it feel good?

1168
7195.62 --> 7217.14
 Touch me.

1169
7217.14 --> 7219.14
 Touch me firmly.

1170
7224.56 --> 7226.56
 You're not good at it.

1171
7227.56 --> 7228.56
 I'm sorry.

1172
7228.56 --> 7230.56
 Touch me firmly.

1173
7244.54 --> 7246.54
 Touch me a lot.

1174
7246.54 --> 7262.02
 Touch me directly.

1175
7291.34 --> 7293.34
 I'm awake now.

1176
7296.34 --> 7298.34
 Touch me.

1177
7310.01 --> 7312.01
 Use your tongue more.

1178
7314.01 --> 7316.01
 Move your tongue a lot.

1179
7323.90 --> 7329.32
 Oh, it feels good.

1180
7330.32 --> 7332.32
 You're good.

1181
7336.32 --> 7338.32
 More.

1182
7338.32 --> 7340.32
 More.

1183
7348.85 --> 7362.98
 It's delicious.

1184
7362.98 --> 7364.98
 Oh, no.

1185
7388.58 --> 7390.58
 What are you doing?

1186
7438.91 --> 7440.91
 Wait a minute.

1187
7440.91 --> 7442.91
 Wait a minute.

1188
7451.38 --> 7453.38
 Oh, no.

1189
7453.38 --> 7464.30
 Why?

1190
7465.30 --> 7467.30
 What?

1191
7467.30 --> 7471.00
 Do you want to lick me?

1192
7471.00 --> 7478.54
 I want to lick you.

1193
7478.54 --> 7510.14
 Do you want to lick me?

1194
7510.14 --> 7512.14
 Do you want to lick me?

1195
7512.14 --> 7514.14
 Do you want to lick me?

1196
7514.14 --> 7516.14
 Yes.

1197
7539.92 --> 7541.92
 Wait a minute.

1198
7544.55 --> 7546.55
 Oh, no.

1199
7551.55 --> 7553.55
 Don't move.

1200
7555.55 --> 7557.55
 Wait a minute.

1201
7557.55 --> 7559.55
 Wait a minute.

1202
7566.06 --> 7568.06
 It feels good.

1203
7569.06 --> 7571.06
 Wait a minute.

1204
7571.06 --> 7573.06
 No, no, no.

1205
7575.88 --> 7577.88
 Do you want to lick me?

1206
7577.88 --> 7579.88
 I want to lick you.

1207
7579.88 --> 7583.58
 Oh, no.

1208
7599.41 --> 7601.41
 Oh, no.

1209
7615.40 --> 7617.40
 No.

1210
7617.40 --> 7619.40
 Don't lick me.

1211
7621.40 --> 7623.40
 I want to lick you.

1212
7628.50 --> 7630.50
 Hurry up.

1213
7632.50 --> 7634.50
 Oh, no.

1214
7635.50 --> 7637.50
 What are you doing?

1215
7637.50 --> 7639.50
 Hurry up.

1216
7639.50 --> 7641.50
 I can't open it.

1217
7641.50 --> 7643.50
 Open it.

1218
7645.50 --> 7648.50
 I'll put it in if you don't put it on me.

1219
7654.50 --> 7656.50
 Put it on me.

1220
7656.50 --> 7658.50
 Put it on me.

1221
7658.50 --> 7660.50
 Did you put it on me?

1222
7660.50 --> 7662.50
 Not yet.

1223
7662.50 --> 7664.50
 I want to put it in.

1224
7664.50 --> 7666.50
 Did you put it on me?

1225
7666.50 --> 7674.87
 Yes, I did.

1226
7678.87 --> 7680.87
 Does it feel good?

1227
7680.87 --> 7689.82
 Yes.

1228
7689.82 --> 7691.82
 I'll put it in if you hurry up.

1229
7691.82 --> 7693.82
 I'll put it in slowly.

1230
7693.82 --> 7695.82
 Slowly?

1231
7695.82 --> 7697.82
 Oh, no.

1232
7697.82 --> 7699.82
 I'll put it in.

1233
7702.70 --> 7704.70
 I'll put it in slowly.

1234
7705.70 --> 7707.70
 Hang in there.

1235
7707.70 --> 7709.70
 I'll do my best.

1236
7709.70 --> 7711.70
 You can do it, right?

1237
7711.70 --> 7713.70
 Yes.

1238
7713.70 --> 7715.70
 This much?

1239
7715.70 --> 7717.70
 This much.

1240
7725.59 --> 7727.59
 This much?

1241
7727.59 --> 7729.59
 Wait a minute.

1242
7729.59 --> 7731.59
 Can you put it in this much?

1243
7733.59 --> 7737.35
 Oh, no.

1244
7737.35 --> 7739.35
 Does it feel good?

1245
7751.06 --> 7753.06
 It feels good, doesn't it?

1246
7753.06 --> 7757.21
 Yes, it does.

1247
7759.21 --> 7761.21
 It's hard.

1248
7765.21 --> 7767.21
 Oh, no.

1249
7772.78 --> 7774.78
 Hey.

1250
7774.78 --> 7776.78
 Say something new.

1251
7790.12 --> 7792.12
 Do you want to kiss me?

1252
7792.12 --> 7794.12
 Why?

1253
7794.12 --> 7796.12
 Why?

1254
7823.21 --> 7825.21
 You look like you're not used to it.

1255
7825.21 --> 7827.21
 You look like you're not used to it.

1256
7827.21 --> 7829.21
 You look like you're not used to it.

1257
7829.21 --> 7831.21
 Try to do it.

1258
7835.21 --> 7837.21
 I can't.

1259
7839.21 --> 7841.21
 Do it.

1260
7851.29 --> 7853.29
 I can't do it because I'm too comfortable.

1261
7853.29 --> 7855.29
 You can do it.

1262
7855.29 --> 7857.29
 Hang in there.

1263
7861.29 --> 7866.52
 Hold the panties.

1264
7866.52 --> 7868.52
 Hold the panties and hang in there.

1265
7874.52 --> 7876.52
 Why?

1266
7876.52 --> 7878.52
 Don't stop.

1267
7880.52 --> 7882.52
 Why?

1268
7882.52 --> 7889.29
 You can do it.

1269
7889.29 --> 7891.29
 You can do it.

1270
7898.97 --> 7900.97
 Don't stop.

1271
7900.97 --> 7902.97
 Don't stop in the middle.

1272
7906.86 --> 7918.23
 Don't stop in the middle.

1273
7920.23 --> 7924.50
 You can do it.

1274
7924.50 --> 7954.86
 More.

1275
7954.86 --> 7956.86
 It feels good.

1276
7976.01 --> 7978.01
 Just like this.

1277
7978.01 --> 7982.86
 Just like this.

1278
7989.51 --> 7991.51
 You can't do it.

1279
7991.51 --> 7993.51
 You can't move.

1280
7995.51 --> 7999.66
 You can't move.

1281
8029.18 --> 8031.18
 Does it feel good?

1282
8031.18 --> 8041.02
 You can do it.

1283
8052.06 --> 8072.39
 It feels good.

1284
8084.22 --> 8086.22
 You can't do it.

1285
8092.22 --> 8094.22
 It feels good.

1286
8102.14 --> 8104.14
 It looks painful.

1287
8121.08 --> 8123.08
 It feels good.

1288
8129.08 --> 8131.08
 You haven't done it yet.

1289
8131.08 --> 8146.74
 You can do it.

1290
8170.31 --> 8172.31
 You can do it.

1291
8191.29 --> 8198.63
 Move more.

1292
8213.86 --> 8215.86
 Move more.

1293
8219.69 --> 8221.69
 You can do it.

1294
8229.83 --> 8231.83
 Don't stop.

1295
8231.83 --> 8233.83
 Don't stop.

1296
8233.83 --> 8244.09
 Move.

1297
8244.09 --> 8246.09
 It feels good.

1298
8279.06 --> 8281.06
 Move more.

1299
8281.06 --> 8287.06
 Move more.

1300
8287.06 --> 8289.06
 Do you want me to move?

1301
8291.06 --> 8293.06
 Do you want me to move?

1302
8295.06 --> 8297.06
 It feels good.

1303
8303.06 --> 8305.06
 Isn't it good?

1304
8309.06 --> 8311.06
 How does it feel?

1305
8311.06 --> 8313.06
 How does it feel?

1306
8313.06 --> 8315.06
 It feels good.

1307
8326.25 --> 8329.75
 You can do it.

1308
8329.75 --> 8331.75
 It's your turn.

1309
8342.46 --> 8344.46
 It feels good.

1310
8353.86 --> 8355.86
 You can't touch here.

1311
8357.86 --> 8359.86
 It feels good.

1312
8359.86 --> 8361.86
 It feels good.

1313
8361.86 --> 8363.86
 It feels good.

1314
8371.03 --> 8377.74
 It feels good.

1315
8387.27 --> 8389.27
 You can do it.

1316
8397.03 --> 8401.43
 Keep doing it.

1317
8416.54 --> 8418.54
 You can do it.

1318
8437.32 --> 8439.32
 Move more.

1319
8443.32 --> 8446.76
 You can do it.

1320
8446.76 --> 8448.76
 You can't do it.

1321
8450.76 --> 8452.76
 What are you doing?

1322
8452.76 --> 8454.76
 What are you doing?

1323
8454.76 --> 8456.76
 Wait a minute.

1324
8458.76 --> 8460.76
 Did you do it?

1325
8460.76 --> 8462.76
 Did you do it?

1326
8466.76 --> 8468.76
 You almost did it.

1327
8470.76 --> 8472.76
 Did you do it?

1328
8474.76 --> 8476.76
 I'm sorry.

1329
8476.76 --> 8478.76
 I'm sorry.

1330
8478.76 --> 8480.76
 I'm sorry.

1331
8484.76 --> 8486.76
 You're not good.

1332
8486.76 --> 8491.93
 You're not good.

1333
8491.93 --> 8493.93
 Why did you do it by yourself?

1334
8493.93 --> 8495.93
 Why did you do it by yourself?

1335
8497.93 --> 8499.93
 Couldn't you bear it?

1336
8509.22 --> 8511.22
 Why did you do it by yourself?

1337
8516.58 --> 8518.58
 Wait a minute.

1338
8522.58 --> 8524.58
 I almost did it.

1339
8528.58 --> 8535.29
 I'm sorry.

1340
8535.29 --> 8537.29
 I'm sorry.

1341
8537.29 --> 8542.33
 I almost did it.

1342
8546.33 --> 8548.33
 Couldn't you bear it?

1343
8554.33 --> 8556.33
 You can't do it anymore?

1344
8556.33 --> 8558.33
 You can't do it anymore?

1345
8562.33 --> 8576.52
 I almost did it.

1346
8576.52 --> 8579.96
 You're so polite.

1347
8579.96 --> 8586.98
 I can't help it.

1348
8586.98 --> 8588.98
 I'm hungry.

1349
8588.98 --> 8590.98
 Do you want to eat something?

1350
8590.98 --> 8592.98
 I'm hungry.

1351
8594.98 --> 8596.98
 Make something.

1352
8600.98 --> 8606.92
 I'll make something.

1353
8606.92 --> 8608.92
 You didn't let me go.

1354
8608.92 --> 8610.92
 Make something delicious.

1355
8610.92 --> 8612.92
 Something delicious?

1356
8612.92 --> 8614.92
 You grabbed my panties.

1357
8614.92 --> 8616.92
 You grabbed my panties.

1358
8624.92 --> 8626.92
 Did it work?

1359
8626.92 --> 8628.92
 Did it work?

1360
8646.20 --> 8648.20
 I'm hungry.

1361
8648.20 --> 8652.79
 You're not satisfied.

1362
8652.79 --> 8654.79
 I'm not satisfied.

1363
8658.79 --> 8660.79
 I'm not satisfied.

1364
8660.79 --> 8664.36
 Make something.

1365
8666.36 --> 8668.36
 I know.

1366
8668.36 --> 8670.36
 I saw it.

1367
8670.36 --> 8672.36
 You made it by yourself.

1368
8672.36 --> 8679.64
 Are you good at cooking?

1369
8681.64 --> 8692.50
 How about you?

1370
8692.50 --> 8694.50
 How about you?

1371
8694.50 --> 8696.50
 I'm good at cooking.

1372
8700.50 --> 8702.50
 What are you doing?

1373
8702.50 --> 8704.50
 You're annoying.

1374
8704.50 --> 8706.50
 You can make fried eggs.

1375
8706.50 --> 8714.04
 But I made it today.

1376
8714.04 --> 8716.04
 There are a lot of seasonings.

1377
8716.04 --> 8720.63
 There are a lot of seasonings.

1378
8720.63 --> 8722.63
 I don't need it.

1379
8731.29 --> 8733.29
 I'm hungry.

1380
8733.29 --> 8735.29
 I'm hungry.

1381
8735.29 --> 8737.29
 Do you eat breakfast?

1382
8739.29 --> 8742.73
 I don't usually eat breakfast.

1383
8748.02 --> 8750.02
 Can you eat yogurt?

1384
8750.02 --> 8752.02
 Is that a banana?

1385
8754.02 --> 8756.02
 I'm an apple.

1386
8760.23 --> 8762.23
 I'm a banana.

1387
8762.23 --> 8764.23
 I didn't hear you.

1388
8764.23 --> 8766.23
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

1389
8768.23 --> 8770.23
 Oh, it's a sausage!

1390
8771.23 --> 8773.23
 Is it okay? Wow.

1391
8792.77 --> 8794.77
 Show me how you make it.

1392
8801.17 --> 8803.17
 Is it too oily?

1393
8810.17 --> 8812.17
 You can crack an egg, can't you?

1394
8813.17 --> 8815.17
 I can do that, too.

1395
8839.34 --> 8841.34
 Hurry up.

1396
8846.06 --> 8848.06
 It's going to splatter.

1397
8850.06 --> 8857.14
 I won't forgive you if you don't do it.

1398
8858.14 --> 8860.14
 I'll do my best to make it delicious.

1399
8863.14 --> 8865.14
 I'll help you.

1400
8866.14 --> 8868.14
 What?

1401
8869.14 --> 8871.14
 I'll help you.

1402
8872.14 --> 8874.14
 What do you mean?

1403
8874.14 --> 8876.14
 I'll help you.

1404
8876.14 --> 8878.14
 What?

1405
8878.14 --> 8880.14
 I'll do this.

1406
8880.14 --> 8882.14
 You're watching over me.

1407
8882.14 --> 8895.38
 It looks good.

1408
8896.38 --> 8898.38
 You're going to get burned.

1409
8899.38 --> 8901.38
 I have cooked rice.

1410
8901.38 --> 8903.38
 I have cooked rice.

1411
8903.38 --> 8905.38
 What?

1412
8905.38 --> 8907.38
 Do you want me to help you?

1413
8913.48 --> 8915.48
 What should I do?

1414
8918.48 --> 8920.48
 Do you want me to help you?

1415
8920.48 --> 8922.48
 You won't get burned, will you?

1416
8922.48 --> 8924.48
 What do you do when you cook?

1417
8924.48 --> 8926.48
 I don't touch your nipples.

1418
8926.48 --> 8928.48
 Why?

1419
8928.48 --> 8930.48
 I can't do anything.

1420
8931.48 --> 8935.50
 Can you look at me?

1421
8935.50 --> 8937.50
 It hurts.

1422
8940.50 --> 8942.50
 How much should I cook?

1423
8942.50 --> 8944.50
 Just a little bit.

1424
8947.50 --> 8949.50
 Do you like it?

1425
8949.50 --> 8951.50
 I was surprised.

1426
8953.50 --> 8955.50
 I like it.

1427
8957.50 --> 8959.50
 I'm done cooking rice.

1428
8960.50 --> 8962.50
 I'm done.

1429
8964.50 --> 8966.50
 I'll put it on a plate.

1430
8968.50 --> 8970.50
 I'm done.

1431
8974.66 --> 8976.66
 Is this enough?

1432
8976.66 --> 8978.66
 Is this enough?

1433
8982.66 --> 8984.66
 Is the sausage on top of the rice cooked?

1434
8984.66 --> 8986.66
 The sausage is running away.

1435
8986.66 --> 8988.66
 I can't get it.

1436
8989.66 --> 8991.66
 It's done.

1437
8992.66 --> 8994.66
 Is it done?

1438
8996.66 --> 8998.66
 I'm making a salad.

1439
8998.66 --> 9002.30
 I'll put the rice on the plate.

1440
9002.30 --> 9004.30
 I'm done.

1441
9008.30 --> 9010.30
 Is this enough?

1442
9010.30 --> 9012.30
 Yes.

1443
9022.28 --> 9024.28
 Is the sausage on top of the rice cooked?

1444
9024.28 --> 9026.28
 Yes.

1445
9026.28 --> 9028.28
 It's not sticking to the plate.

1446
9030.28 --> 9032.28
 I'll put this on the plate, too.

1447
9032.28 --> 9034.28
 I'm done.

1448
9034.28 --> 9036.28
 I'm done.

1449
9039.28 --> 9041.28
 It looks delicious.

1450
9047.28 --> 9054.94
 What's next?

1451
9054.94 --> 9058.45
 What's next?

1452
9058.45 --> 9060.45
 Is it miso soup?

1453
9061.45 --> 9063.45
 It smells like breakfast.

1454
9075.36 --> 9077.36
 What's next?

1455
9077.36 --> 9079.36
 I'll put this on the plate.

1456
9081.36 --> 9083.36
 I'm done.

1457
9083.36 --> 9085.36
 I'll put chopsticks on the plate.

1458
9091.23 --> 9093.23
 It's sweet.

1459
9093.23 --> 9095.23
 Don't break it.

1460
9096.23 --> 9098.23
 Go, go.

1461
9107.18 --> 9109.18
 It looks like breakfast.

1462
9112.18 --> 9114.18
 I want natto.

1463
9115.18 --> 9117.18
 Yogurt?

1464
9120.18 --> 9122.18
 Do you have yogurt?

1465
9124.18 --> 9126.18
 I'm hungry.

1466
9126.18 --> 9128.18
 I want to eat it.

1467
9128.18 --> 9130.18
 I want to eat natto.

1468
9152.35 --> 9154.35
 Spoon?

1469
9154.35 --> 9156.35
 There are many processes.

1470
9157.35 --> 9159.35
 Thank you for the breakfast.

1471
9159.35 --> 9182.12
 Hurry up.

1472
9184.12 --> 9192.04
 It's an ideal breakfast.

1473
9199.08 --> 9209.82
 I'll enjoy it.

1474
9212.82 --> 9218.43
 It's my first time to eat like this.

1475
9237.32 --> 9239.32
 It's delicious.

1476
9244.63 --> 9246.63
 You ate it all at once.

1477
9248.63 --> 9250.63
 It's impossible.

1478
9250.63 --> 9252.63
 What do you mean?

1479
9252.63 --> 9254.63
 It's impossible.

1480
9270.28 --> 9272.28
 It was delicious.

1481
9272.28 --> 9274.28
 There are only two pieces.

1482
9274.28 --> 9276.28
 I ate it all.

1483
9277.28 --> 9279.28
 It's impossible.

1484
9279.28 --> 9281.28
 It's impossible.

1485
9281.28 --> 9283.28
 I ate it all.

1486
9285.28 --> 9287.28
 You didn't let me eat it at once.

1487
9287.28 --> 9289.28
 It's okay.

1488
9289.28 --> 9291.28
 I'll give you a reward.

1489
9291.28 --> 9293.28
 I'll give you a reward.

1490
9305.17 --> 9307.17
 It's like thin hair.

1491
9307.17 --> 9309.17
 It's sticky.

1492
9310.17 --> 9312.17
 Do you want to watch a movie?

1493
9312.17 --> 9314.17
 It's sticky.

1494
9314.17 --> 9316.17
 It's sticky.

1495
9325.59 --> 9327.59
 You can't do that to food.

1496
9327.59 --> 9329.59
 Thank you.

1497
9335.27 --> 9343.00
 Don't open your mouth.

1498
9343.00 --> 9348.62
 Don't open your mouth.

1499
9348.62 --> 9350.62
 Don't open your mouth.

1500
9355.62 --> 9357.62
 If you eat natto, you can't chew it.

1501
9360.62 --> 9363.99
 Thank you.

1502
9368.90 --> 9370.90
 Thank you for the meal.

1503
9370.90 --> 9372.90
 It was delicious.

1504
9372.90 --> 9374.90
 I'm full.

1505
9376.90 --> 9378.90
 I'll go home.

1506
9378.90 --> 9401.42
 I'll go home.

1507
9401.42 --> 9410.62
 Will the sea come?

1508
9410.62 --> 9412.62
 No, it won't.

1509
9425.64 --> 9427.64
 Is this okay?

1510
9427.64 --> 9439.08
 Yes.

1511
9439.08 --> 9441.08
 I have a lot of spare.

1512
9443.08 --> 9445.08
 I can bring a lot of people.

1513
9445.08 --> 9447.08
 No.

1514
9447.08 --> 9449.08
 No.

1515
9459.11 --> 9461.11
 Do you always do this?

1516
9461.11 --> 9465.77
 Yes.

1517
9465.77 --> 9467.77
 What?

1518
9467.77 --> 9469.77
 I'm brushing my teeth.

1519
9469.77 --> 9471.77
 It's cute.

1520
9473.77 --> 9475.77
 Thank you for the meal.

1521
9475.77 --> 9477.77
 It's cute.

1522
9477.77 --> 9479.77
 It's hard to touch.

1523
9479.77 --> 9481.77
 What's going on?

1524
9483.77 --> 9487.59
 What's going on?

1525
9489.59 --> 9491.59
 Do you like brushing your teeth?

1526
9491.59 --> 9493.59
 Yes.

1527
9495.59 --> 9497.59
 Do you like brushing your teeth?

1528
9497.59 --> 9499.59
 Yes.

1529
9499.59 --> 9504.31
 Thank you for the meal.

1530
9508.26 --> 9510.26
 It's dangerous to do this.

1531
9510.26 --> 9512.26
 Thank you for the meal.

1532
9531.50 --> 9533.50
 Is it okay to put this here?

1533
9533.50 --> 9535.50
 Yes.

1534
9539.50 --> 9541.50
 I'm done brushing my teeth.

1535
9551.58 --> 9553.58
 Hurry up and brush your teeth.

1536
9553.58 --> 9555.58
 Hurry up and brush your teeth.

1537
9555.58 --> 9557.58
 I'm going to sleep.

1538
9559.58 --> 9561.58
 What are you doing?

1539
9563.58 --> 9565.58
 It's a nice day today.

1540
9565.58 --> 9567.58
 Yes.

1541
9567.58 --> 9575.18
 I'm going to sleep.

1542
9577.18 --> 9579.18
 I'm looking forward to it.

1543
9585.18 --> 9587.18
 I wish I could stay up all night.

1544
9587.18 --> 9589.18
 I had a lot of fun in the morning.

1545
9595.18 --> 9597.18
 I want to kiss you soon.

1546
9603.18 --> 9605.18
 It's time to sleep.

1547
9609.18 --> 9611.18
 Hurry up and brush your teeth.

1548
9611.18 --> 9613.18
 A little more.

1549
9613.18 --> 9615.18
 A little more.

1550
9615.18 --> 9617.18
 I'm waiting for you.

1551
9621.18 --> 9625.13
 I'm going home.

1552
9632.17 --> 9634.17
 Good night.

1553
9634.17 --> 9636.17
 Good night.

1554
9658.06 --> 9660.06
 Good night.

1555
9665.48 --> 9667.48
 Do you want to brush your teeth?

1556
9679.19 --> 9681.19
 I'm not done yet.

1557
9681.19 --> 9683.19
 You're taking too long.

1558
9683.19 --> 9685.19
 You're taking too long.

1559
9688.57 --> 9690.57
 I'm going to sleep.

1560
9696.57 --> 9704.42
 Are you done?

1561
9704.42 --> 9706.42
 No, I'm not done yet.

1562
9718.09 --> 9719.09
 What?

1563
9719.09 --> 9743.10
 I don't know.

1564
9751.10 --> 9754.10
 You were standing a lot when I took you out.

1565
9754.10 --> 9755.10
 Hey.

1566
9755.10 --> 9756.10
 Stand up.

1567
9756.10 --> 9758.10
 Be satisfied by yourself.

1568
9758.10 --> 9759.10
 I'm sorry.

1569
9759.10 --> 9760.10
 Be satisfied by yourself.

1570
9760.10 --> 9762.10
 Have a meal.

1571
9762.10 --> 9764.10
 Why?

1572
9764.10 --> 9765.10
 I'm sorry.

1573
9765.10 --> 9766.10
 Hey.

1574
9779.06 --> 9780.06
 Look at me.

1575
9792.46 --> 9794.46
 Be satisfied by yourself.

1576
9797.46 --> 9807.14
 I'm sorry.

1577
9809.14 --> 9810.14
 I can't.

1578
9812.14 --> 9813.14
 I'm going to go.

1579
9813.14 --> 9814.14
 What?

1580
9814.14 --> 9815.14
 I'm going to go.

1581
9815.14 --> 9816.14
 What?

1582
9816.14 --> 9817.14
 Are you going to go?

1583
9817.14 --> 9818.14
 I'm going.

1584
9819.14 --> 9820.14
 Don't go yet.

1585
9821.14 --> 9822.14
 One more.

1586
9827.14 --> 9828.14
 I'm done.

1587
9828.14 --> 9829.14
 I'm done.

1588
9829.14 --> 9830.14
 So, Go.

1589
9830.14 --> 9831.14
 I'm done.

1590
9831.14 --> 9832.14
 Go.

1591
9832.14 --> 9833.14
 I'm done.

1592
9833.14 --> 9834.14
 Are you sure?

1593
9836.14 --> 9837.14
 Mom.

1594
9837.14 --> 9838.14
 What's the matter?

1595
9838.14 --> 9839.14
 Hold on.

1596
9851.39 --> 9852.39
 Did you have fun?

1597
9852.39 --> 9854.39
 Yes, I did.

1598
9866.04 --> 9870.06
 What is it?

1599
9870.06 --> 9872.06
 You look beautiful.

1600
9872.06 --> 9874.06
 Why did you say that?

1601
9874.06 --> 9876.06
 You look beautiful again.

1602
9876.06 --> 9878.06
 Thank you.

1603
9880.06 --> 9882.06
 Did you enjoy the meal?

1604
9882.06 --> 9886.97
 Yes.

1605
9886.97 --> 9888.97
 I'm leaving.

1606
9888.97 --> 9890.97
 Thank you.

1607
9912.94 --> 9914.94
 I'm really leaving.

1608
9914.94 --> 9921.83
 Thank you.

1609
9923.83 --> 9925.83
 I'm leaving.

1610
9925.83 --> 9927.83
 What?

1611
9927.83 --> 9935.69
 I'm leaving.

1612
9943.69 --> 9945.69
 Please talk to me.

1613
9962.12 --> 9964.12
 You should have said you were lonely.

1614
9964.12 --> 9966.12
 Yes, I'm lonely.

1615
9966.12 --> 9968.12
 I want to be with you more.

1616
9976.63 --> 9978.63
 What?

1617
9978.63 --> 9980.63
 I want to hear your voice.

1618
9980.63 --> 9982.63
 Here?

1619
9982.63 --> 9990.30
 Here, too?

1620
9992.30 --> 9994.30
 But...

1621
9994.30 --> 9998.70
 Let me see.

1622
10002.70 --> 10004.70
 This is the entrance.

1623
10006.70 --> 10008.70
 You look lonely.

1624
10010.70 --> 10012.70
 I'm lonely.

1625
10033.67 --> 10039.77
 I can't help it.

1626
10062.87 --> 10064.87
 You look lonely.

1627
10073.72 --> 10075.72
 You didn't say you were lonely.

1628
10077.72 --> 10091.21
 Yes.

1629
10093.21 --> 10095.21
 I'm lonely.

1630
10095.21 --> 10097.21
 Really?

1631
10097.21 --> 10099.21
 I'm lonely, too.

1632
10099.21 --> 10101.21
 I'm lonely.

1633
10101.21 --> 10103.21
 I want to be with you more.

1634
10103.21 --> 10105.21
 Do you want to be with me more?

1635
10105.21 --> 10107.21
 Do you want to be with me again?

1636
10107.21 --> 10109.21
 I'm lonely.

1637
10111.21 --> 10113.21
 Oh, my goodness.

1638
10113.21 --> 10115.21
 Oh, my goodness.

1639
10121.35 --> 10123.35
 I'm leaving.

1640
10123.35 --> 10125.35
 I want to have more fun.

1641
10129.35 --> 10131.35
 Oh, my goodness.

1642
10131.35 --> 10133.35
 I'm leaving.

1643
10138.66 --> 10140.66
 I didn't touch you.

1644
10140.66 --> 10144.17
 I'm leaving.

1645
10152.55 --> 10154.55
 Well?

1646
10154.55 --> 10156.55
 Then I'm leaving.

1647
10158.55 --> 10160.55
 How about you?

1648
10160.55 --> 10162.55
 I'm going to come out.

1649
10166.55 --> 10168.55
 I'm going to come out.

1650
10168.55 --> 10170.55
 That's it.

1651
10170.55 --> 10172.55
 It's time.

1652
10174.55 --> 10176.55
 I'm leaving.

1653
10176.55 --> 10178.55
 Finished.

1654
10178.55 --> 10180.55
 Do you want to open the door?

1655
10224.28 --> 10226.28
 Oh, wait a minute.

1656
10226.28 --> 10228.28
 Kana-san.

1657
10228.28 --> 10230.28
 If you don't mind,

1658
10230.28 --> 10232.28
 how about having a meal together next time?

1659
10232.28 --> 10234.28
 What?

1660
10234.28 --> 10236.28
 I can't exchange contacts.

1661
10236.28 --> 10238.28
 Let's exchange contacts.

1662
10238.28 --> 10240.28
 It was fun.

1663
10240.28 --> 10242.28
 Thank you.

1664
10242.28 --> 10244.28
 I'll tell you my contact.

1665
10244.28 --> 10246.28
 No, no, no.

1666
10246.28 --> 10248.28
 Bye.
