00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,440
Curry Tube

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,930
Thank you for your presents.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,890
Thank you.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,430
After this, let's take a rest at the inn.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,090
OK.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,151
Well... Hey, Hayashi.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,250
Are we there yet? Well.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,630
..

9
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,030
I think we'll be there soon.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,910
It's been a long time since
I've been to a hot spring.

11
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:33,750
Do you have a open-air
bath, Hayashi-kun? Yes, I do.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,290


13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,830
Yay!

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,430
Let's go in together.

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,930
I want to go in.

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,150
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,310
Okay.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,730
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

19
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:49,250
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

20
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:49,610
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

21
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:49,890
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

22
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:50,550
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,030
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

24
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:51,810
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,150
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

26
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,210
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,870
We're going on a business
trip, so don't miss it.

28
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:03,110
What's going on?

29
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,411
It's strange that there are only two rooms.

30
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,530
We are four people in one room,
but Hayashi is in a single room.

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,150
The balance is bad.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,790
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:18,685
If I told you the budget and
the number, it would be like this.

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,130
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,350
Well, it can't be helped.

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,190
It doesn't seem to be
so narrow, so this is fine.

37
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,790
Or do you want to be with Hayashi?

38
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,911
Do you want to stay
with me? No, no, no.

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,291
You don't, do you? OK, then.

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,790


41
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,810
Let's have dinner together after this.

42
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,310
OK.

43
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,810
Shall we go to the hotel
room? What? Let's go.

44
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,130
Let's go.

45
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,730
Let's go.

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,710



47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,760
Let's go to the room with Hayashi.

48
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,270
What? Don't go.

49
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,530
I'll see you at the meeting.

50
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:49,531
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

53
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,211
This is a man's room.

54
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,290
Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:29,520
Are you OK? I'm OK.

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

58
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,420
See you later.

60
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,770


61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
OK.

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,220
I didn't see you.

64
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,840
Oh, I see.

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,140
It's small, isn't
it? Yes, it is.

66
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,141


67
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,210
Hey, why are you coming this way?

68
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:01,211
What?

69
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,910
Because I'm a man.

70
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,790
No way.

71
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,800
I told you so.

72
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm a man.

73
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,080
Please get out of here.

74
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Wait a minute.

75
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
What?

76
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,710
What?

77
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,670
Oh, wait a minute.

78
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,550
This is a men's room.

79
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,590
Oh, is it? Yes, it is.

80
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,230


81
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,370
Oh, it's a men's room.

82
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,070
So, please get out of here.

83
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,380
So, it's a men's room, isn't it?

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,600
No, it's a men's room.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
What is it?

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,540
What is it? Oh, yes.

87
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820


88
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,570
What?

89
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,550
What?

90
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,830
Hey, hey, it's a problem.

91
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,310
I told you I'm a man.

92
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,710
What? You're right.

93
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,310


94
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,290
Why do you make a mistake?

95
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,690
Do you want to come in with me?

96
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,130
What? No, I'm fine.

97
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,010
Just kidding. See you.

98
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,050
What's going on?

99
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,190
Are you sure you're okay?

100
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,270
Wow, it looks so delicious.

101
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,130
It looks so delicious.

102
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,850
Thank you for your present today.

103
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,230
Thank you.

104
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,850
Hayashi, say cheers.

105
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,490
Me?

106
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,510
Thank you for your present.

107
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:44,750
Thank you very much.
The presentation went well and...

108
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm so full.

109
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,610
I want to drink sake.

110
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,170
Let's toast.

111
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:50,910
Let's drink.

112
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Cheers!

113
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,470
Cheers!

114
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
You drink so fast.

115
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I want to drink sake.

116
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,370
I see.

117
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
You drink so fast.

118
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,540
Were you thirsty? I love sake.

119
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,360
Excuse me.

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,080
Thank you.

121
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,081
Be careful.

122
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320


123
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:15,680
Yes.

124
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
You look like a fool.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,580
You can see my face.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Well, then.

129
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,410
You are great.

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,160
You look like a fool.

132
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I'll take it.

134
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,440
What?

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,100
Is he the director?

137
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
He is a little polite.

138
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,800
No, no, no.

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:37,880
What?

140
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Is he a fool? No, he is not.

141
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,740
What are you doing?

142
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,040
I want to eat it.

143
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,360
I'll do it.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Will you do it?

145
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,880
You are too late.

146
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,520
Thank you.

147
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,620
It looks delicious.

148
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Is it a squid?

149
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Is it a salmon? It's a scallop.

150
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
It's a scallop.

151
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,460
It's delicious.

152
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,200
It's fresh.

153
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,840
It's soft.

154
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,000
It's good, isn't it?

155
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Yeah, it's good.

156
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
I can't stop drinking.

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,980
Yeah, it's good.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
I'm going to change.

159
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
You're fast.

160
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,980
You're too fast.

161
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,540
I used to drink a lot when I was a student.

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Here you are.

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I think it's almost gone.

164
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Yeah, it's amazing.

165
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,610
You should eat more.

166
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,590
Thank you.

167
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:06,591
Thank you for the meal.

168
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,750
Are you eating nutritious food?

169
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,190
No, I usually eat cup noodles.

170
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,050
At a convenience store?

171
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,190
That's why you can't work.

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
That's right.

173
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,250
Eat a lot.

175
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,090
I'm sorry I pulled my legs today.

176
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,830
You were biting a lot.

177
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,230
You have to get used to it.

178
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,370
Yes.

179
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,571
Are you nervous about work?

180
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,990
I'm not good at talking in front of people.

181
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,510
Excuse me.

182
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Are you okay? It's amazing.

183
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,990
It's amazing.

184
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,850


185
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,510
I have Japanese sake.

186
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,130
Japanese sake?

187
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,710
It's a big deal.

188
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,190
I'll change it to Japanese sake.

189
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,210
I'll have a drink.

190
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,310
Don't spill it.

191
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,450
Here we go.

192
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,530
Oh, no.

193
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,610
Hey, there's more here.

194
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,010
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,350
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,510
Oh, no.

197
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:17,511
What are you doing? I'm sorry.

198
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,430
It's okay.

199
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,090
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,670
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,790


202
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,930
You can't even wear it.

203
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,810
I'm really sorry.

204
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:31,811
I'm really sorry.

205
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,930
We ate a lot.

206
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,310
It's good to eat like this once in a while.

207
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,210
It's fun.

208
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,350
It refreshes me.

209
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,450
I have to eat.

210
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,050
I can't help it.

211
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,410
I ran out of sake.

212
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,700
I don't have beer, so
I'll have Japanese sake.

213
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,690
I see.

214
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,170
That's right.

215
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,350
You should have noticed it earlier.

216
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Don't spill it.

217
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
You spilled it.

218
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:20,550
You spilled it.

219
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,770
This is not good.

220
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,370
It's good.

221
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,970
Let's pour some for everyone.

222
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,150
Yeah, pour some for them.

223
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,590
Then I'll pour some for you.

224
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,370
Excuse me.

225
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,170
I want to drink.

226
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,810
It's a Japanese sake party.

227
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,150
You're pouring it properly.

228
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,350
My legs are numb.

229
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,240
Do you want some Japanese sake?

230
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,400
Are you sure?

231
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,600
I want to drink it.

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,160
I want to drink it, too.

233
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
I see.

234
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,060
Excuse me.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Excuse me.

236
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,801
Oh, sorry.

237
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
I spilled the tea.

239
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,540
What are you doing?

241
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:41,552
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

242
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:56,520
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

243
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,420
Oh, sorry.

244
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
You're late.

245
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
You're late.

246
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,800
Excuse me.

247
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
Oh?

248
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,280
Oh, you're here.

249
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,680
You've grown up.

250
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
You've grown up.

251
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,530
Why are you sitting there?

252
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,010
What's wrong?

253
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,810
No, I don't think so.

254
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,170
I don't know.

255
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,290
You don't have to ask.

256
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,130
Hey, it's gone.

257
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,590
See, it's gone.

258
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,050
Give it to him.

259
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,930
Thank you.

260
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,030
Did you grab it?

261
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,510
I'm grabbing it.

262
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,770
Don't worry, everyone.

263
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,350
Hey, it's me.

264
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,550
Do you drink a lot?

265
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,210
Yes.

266
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,430
Are you weak?

267
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,810
I can't drink it at all.

268
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,670
It's okay.

269
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,290
It's delicious.

270
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,830
One more time.

271
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,660
I'm going to drink it.

272
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:20,661
Wow.

273
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Drink it.

274
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,260
Put it on your lips.

275
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Hurry up.

276
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
It's getting wet!

277
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
It's getting wet! It's OK.

278
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160


279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm going to drink it.

280
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,820
I can't drink that much.

281
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,520
It's getting wet.

282
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
It's getting wet.

283
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,260
It's because of your shoulders.

284
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,260
I'll give you a massage.

285
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,261
I'll do it for you.

286
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
I have a shoulder.

287
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Shoulder? I see.

288
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,850


289
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Like this? Harder.

290
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840


291
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Wow.

292
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,910
I'll do it next.

293
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,010
I'll do it next.

294
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,580
Hayashi, are you good at it?

295
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,920
Yes.

296
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,100
You just touched it.

297
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,340
Don't push too hard.

298
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:30,341
I did it.

299
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Push more.

300
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,300
There, there, push more.

301
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,140
Yes, yes, yes.

302
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
Not bad.

303
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Not bad.

304
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,240
Yes, there.

305
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,560
It's wrinkled, isn't
it? Loosen it more.

306
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100


307
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,620
Yes, yes, it feels good.

308
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,040
You did it.

309
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
I was praised.

310
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Yes.

311
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
How is it?

312
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Is it good?

313
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Is it good?

314
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Hayashi, are you angry?

315
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,220
Me? No, I'm not.

316
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,256
Do you want me to
massage you? No, I'm fine.

317
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280


318
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:11,820
Why? No, no, no.

319
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,480


320
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:13,920
Do you want to see? No, I don't.

321
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380


322
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,260
What?

323
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,800
Why?

324
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
What?

325
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Where are you angry?

326
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
What? Where?

327
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,560
Where are you angry? My feet.

328
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:21,900


329
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Your feet?

330
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,525
What's wrong? It looks painful.

331
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
No, no, no.

332
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,920
A little, a little.

333
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
You're a couple.

334
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,540
You're a couple.

335
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
You're going out today.

336
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Yes, I'm okay.

337
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,140
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,440
What? Wait.

339
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,620
What?

340
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
What is this?

341
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,000
What is this?

342
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Who is he?

343
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,660
What's wrong?

344
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
What?

345
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
What?

346
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,440
What are you playing?

347
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,240
It's a different thing.

348
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:55,540
What's different?

349
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
What's this?

350
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
What?

351
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
What are you doing?

352
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,040
What made you so
excited? It's so shaped.

353
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,960


354
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,580
Isn't it big? It's big.

355
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,720
But it smells.

356
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900


357
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,020
It was in the bathroom, wasn't it?

358
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
No.

359
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
I didn't bring my underwear.

360
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,360
You didn't bring your underwear?

361
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:20,640
You don't have
underwear? It's dirty.

362
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,720
Oh, dirty.

363
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200


364
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,500
Take off your dirty underwear.

365
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,360
Take it off?

366
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Why not?

367
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Take off? It's dirty.

368
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,280
It's stinky.

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
This is a smelly underwear.

370
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,220
Take it off.

371
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Take it off!

372
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,240
Take it off!

373
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:44,980
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

374
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,000
Hurry up!

375
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Are you ready?

376
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Hurry up!

377
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,700
Take it off! Take it
off! Take it off! I got it.

378
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900


379
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Wow!

380
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,940
I've never seen such a thing!

381
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,140
It's amazing!

382
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,400
I've never seen such a thing.

383
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,070
It's so big.

384
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,560
Everyone told me to take it off.

385
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,660
Why did you make it
so big? Hey, touch it.

386
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,180
What? Touch it.

387
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,660



388
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,300
Why? It's a freebie.

389
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Touch it.

390
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,120
No, no, no.

391
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,180
Touch it.

392
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,720


393
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:35,710
I don't have a handkerchief.

394
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,150
No, you don't.

395
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:38,151
Why?

396
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,030
Why?

397
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,670
The one who lost the
rock-paper-scissors touch it.

398
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,190
The one who lost?

399
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,070
Rock-paper-scissors!

400
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,610
Rock-paper-scissors!

401
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,310
Rock-paper-scissors!

402
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:51,350
Rock-paper-scissors!

403
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,890
What? What?

404
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,810
What? What?

405
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,230
What? What? What? Wait.

406
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,231
Your hand.

407
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,270


408
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,590
..

409
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,030
What?

410
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,031
Wow!

411
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,890
What is this?

412
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,150
What is this? Please stop it.

413
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,850


414
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,750
Is this a YouTube
video? No, it's not.

415
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440


416
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,610
I was surprised.

417
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,010
Oh, my God.

418
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,550
Oh, my God.

419
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,270
It's moving.

420
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,430
Oh, my God.

421
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:26,431
What is this?

422
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,590
What is this?

423
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,450
It's a little bit small.

424
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,630
Don't open your eyes!

425
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,050
I lost to the second time, so I'm sorry.

426
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,350
One more time.

427
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,070
Wait a minute.

428
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,590
Look at this.

429
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,330
Calm down.

430
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,070
He moved a lot.

431
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,230
How did he do that?

432
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,990
Wow! Wait a minute.

433
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,311
Wow!

434
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,250
Wow!

435
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
It's huge!

436
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,830
It's moving!

437
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,570
It's moving!

438
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,930
It's moving!

439
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,190
Let it stand more.

440
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,970
Look!

441
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,970
It's moving!

442
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,930
It's moving!

443
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,230
It's moving!

444
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,670
Is it reacting?

445
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,970
Wow!

446
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,910
Let me take it off.

447
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
What is it? Imagine it.

448
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,050


449
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,210
How is it?

450
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,390
It's moving!

451
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,270
It's moving!

452
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,930
The blood vessels are amazing.

453
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,410
It's alive.

454
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,750
Amazing.

455
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,330
I didn't know there was a mole here.

456
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,910
It's true!

457
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,170
Isn't it slanted?

458
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:49,010
Isn't it big?

459
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:51,070
Can you put it in?

460
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,510
This is the only way
to do it! Please try it.

461
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,070


462
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,850
It moved!

463
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,910
Hold it! Hold it! I will try it.

464
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,010


465
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,130
It's upside down!

466
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:12,131
Let me see! Here too.

467
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,990


468
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,590
Wow!

469
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,330
I got a good one.

470
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,170
Let me see!

471
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,570
Let me see!

472
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,890
I got a good one.

473
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
I'll borrow a good one.

474
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,430
What?

475
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,970
Wow!

476
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,670
It's a good one.

477
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,110
It's dirty.

478
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
Wow!

479
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,790
If this was Uekura...

480
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,110
You have to clean it.

481
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,290
Do you want to try wrapping it?

482
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,890
Do you wrap it?

483
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,110
You can touch it directly.

484
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,790
If you tear one sheet...

485
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,930
It looks like a living thing.

486
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,790
Wow!

487
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:08,990
How is it?

488
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,450
It's hot!

489
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:10,830
Hot?

490
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,290
It's getting hot.

491
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,990
Let me stand up.

492
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,870
How many percent
is it? It's 30%.

493
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,651
30%?

494
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,890
It's not hot at all.

495
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,530
Let me stand up quickly.

496
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,690
Quickly.

497
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,490
Oh, it's the butt.

498
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,290
Let me see.

499
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,090
What is it? It's the butt.

500
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,250


501
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,810
Which one do you like?

502
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:37,811
The butt or the boobs?

503
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,190
Which one?

504
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,330
Which one do you like?

505
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,550
Which one? Pick one.

506
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,970
Not wow.

507
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,590


508
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,570
What are you looking
at? What? Hurry up.

509
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,530


510
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,290


511
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,790
Which one do you like? Pick one.

512
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,950
I can't choose.

513
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,230


514
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,950
You can't?

515
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,530
I don't think so.

516
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,910
I don't think so.

517
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,590
You can't?

518
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,950
Let's decide who to touch.

519
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,430
Rock-paper-scissors again?

520
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,730
Rock-paper-scissors?

521
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,290
Our team will lose again.

522
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,650
No, we won't.

523
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,030
Rock-paper-scissors.

524
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:26,031
Oh!

525
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,410
Rock, paper, scissors!

526
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,250
Rock, paper, scissors!

527
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,790
Rock, paper, scissors!

528
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,350
Oh!

529
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,790
You lost!

530
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,110
OK!

531
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,570
Rock, paper, scissors!

532
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,270
Yeah!

533
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,770
What?

534
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,190
Does it mean we change?

535
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,690
It's a 30% chance!

536
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,630
30%?

537
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,590
100%?

538
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,530
Hurry up!

539
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,030
Hurry up!

540
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,930
Does it feel good?

541
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
How do you feel? Well.

542
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,550
..

543
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,790
It feels good a little bit.

544
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,170
What are you talking about?

545
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,710
It doesn't feel good.

546
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,070
It feels good.

547
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
See?

548
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,450
Hurry up!

549
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:17,451
Is Sate coming?

550
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,390
Is Sate coming?

551
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,630
Can't I sit here?

552
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:21,670
You don't like this part?

553
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,290
You like this part.

554
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,970
You like this part.

555
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
She likes her nipples.

556
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,770
Look at her nipples.

557
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:32,011
Her nipples are getting bigger.

558
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,550
Wow.

559
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,430
It's so hard.

560
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,330
It's twitching.

561
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,150
It's wrapped.

562
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:49,670
It's sealed, so you
can lick it as it is, right?

563
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,290
Oh?

564
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,390
Really? Wait a minute.

565
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:53,310


566
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,570
Why?

567
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,690
It's not your fault.

568
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,830
It's not my fault.

569
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,390
It's your fault.

570
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,330
Yeah.

571
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,910
It's getting bigger.

572
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,510
It's getting bigger.

573
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,730
How is it?

574
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:09,731
How is it?

575
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,070
How is it?

576
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,630
What does it taste like?

577
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,630
It's full of juice.

578
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,070
It's too big.

579
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,450
It's bigger than my boyfriend's.

580
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,730
What is this? It's so big.

581
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,270
It's so hard.

582
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,950


583
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,810
What is this? It's so sticky.

584
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,130


585
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,090
Is it hot? Yes, it is.

586
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,350
Wow, it's hard.

587
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,390


588
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,890
I can't get it in.

589
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,646
You're moving your hips,
aren't you? No, I'm not.

590
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,750
Really? No, I'm not.

591
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,070
You're shaking.

592
00:25:21,071 --> 00:25:22,071


593
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,530
You're moving your hips.

594
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,410
Wow, you're shaking, too.

595
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,610
That's right.

596
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,710
Look, it's getting bigger.

597
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,170
It's hard.

598
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:38,530
What's wrong with you?

599
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:39,531
You made it so hard.

600
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,710
Let's eat.

601
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
How is it?

602
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,390
It's like a wrap.

603
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,930
It doesn't go in at all.

604
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,890
It doesn't go in at all.

605
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:02,891
I want to see it.

606
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,130
Let's see.

607
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,330
Wow.

608
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,890
Wow.

609
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,370
Wow.

610
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:21,430
Wow.

611
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:22,690
Wow.

612
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,590
It's black.

613
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,030
Wow.

614
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,031
Wow.

615
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,670
Wow, that's amazing.

616
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,190
Rapping is tough.

617
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,050
It's really tough.

618
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,350
Wow.

619
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,830
Wow.

620
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,370
Wow.

621
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,550
Wow.

622
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,310
Do you play Sanju Game?

623
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,830
Sanju Game?

624
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,090
Do you know what that is?

625
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,050
I know what it is.

626
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,270
You cut it with your hands.

627
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,990
I've heard of it.

628
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,150
1, 2, 3.

629
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,850
The loser of this game
will get a ferrari like this?

630
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,750
How about that?

631
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,170
This is a match that can't be lost.

632
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,070
It's huge.

633
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,310
Go to sleep.

634
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,910
I'm sleepy.

635
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,610
Let's go to sleep.

636
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:21,150
Let's go around the clock.

637
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,151
Let's go clockwise.

638
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,710
1, 2, 3!

639
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,650
What are you doing?

640
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,010
What's next?

641
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,790
Clockwise? Me? This way.

642
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070


643
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,190


644
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,050
How long?

645
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,950
Yes, think about it.

646
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,990
4, 5, 6.

647
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,370
You're attacking.

648
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,810
7.

649
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,370
Sexy.

650
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,290
How to touch.

651
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,030
Nine.

652
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,030
Ten.

653
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,210
Eleven.

654
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,370
Twelve.

655
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,350
How is it?

656
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Stop at twelve? From thirteen.

657
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,630


658
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,930
13

659
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,490
14

660
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,770
Do you feel good, Hayashi?

661
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,830
Yes.

662
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,650
15

663
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,210
Stop at 14!

664
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,390
14

665
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
15

666
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
16

667
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,490
What?

668
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:49,870
What is it?

669
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,390
You can't say it!

670
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,990
How do I do that? I can't go on.

671
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,910
20, 21, 22.

672
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:11,130
..

673
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,670
You are getting closer and closer.

674
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,590
Go on, go on! Twenty.

675
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,330
..three! Twenty.

676

Twenty-five!

679
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,470
Twenty-five?

680
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,650
It's almost there!

681
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:38,990
Oh no!

682
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,610
It's in my mouth!

683
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,590
What should I do? 26, 27, 28.

684
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:51,170


685
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:59,410
What was it?

686
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,090
29.

687
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,370
It's 29.

688
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,830
Here we go.

689
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,170
20

690
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,070
20

691
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,090
20

692
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,390

696
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,890


697
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,330
30

698
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,070
30

699
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:34,590
30

700
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:34,630
30

701
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:34,870
30

702
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,230
We've opened the souvenir book.

703
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,690
What's this? Can I
lick it? Yes, you can.

704
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,131
You said it yourself.

705
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,410
I shouldn't have said that.

706
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,330
I'm going to lick it.

707
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,010
Look at me, Hayashi.

708
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,870
Look at me.

709
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:02,530
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

710
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,630
Don't move your hip.

711
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,810
I am not moving.

712
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:16,250
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

713
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,010
Wow, that's amazing.

714
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,810
Wow, that's a great sound.

715
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,490
It's getting more intense.

716
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,570
It's dripping.

717
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,710
That's how you usually lick it.

718
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
It's embarrassing.

719
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,190
It smells good.

720
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,191
Let's eat it properly.

721
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,690
Wow, it's amazing.

722
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,970
You're taking a lot.

723
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,710
You like to eat blood, don't you?

724
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,990
Wow, it's amazing.

725
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,430
It became hard.

726
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:05,690
It's getting smaller!

727
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,350
Look!

728
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,490
Look here!

729
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,390
The gap is huge!

730
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,090
The gap is huge!

731
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,630
Amazing!

732
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,250
What kind of room do you usually live in?

733
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,891
What kind of room do you usually live in?

734
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,150
Show us!

735
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,070
Are you going to show us?

736
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,570
Show us!

737
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:27,870
Show us your daily life.

738
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,850
How do you manage it?

739
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,050
What? I'm curious.

740
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,710
Who is it?

741
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,910
Who is it?

742
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,130
Well, I guess it's Sefure.

743
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,650
I'm curious.

744
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,930
I'm curious.

745
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:41,790
I'm curious.

746
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:42,130
Well, show me.

747
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,430
Show me.

748
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,710
Well, first of all,

749
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,391
Well, first of all, I'll
start from the bottom.

750
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,250
I'll start from the bottom.

751
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:49,410
I'll start from the bottom.

752
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:49,490
I'll start from the bottom.

753
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:49,510
I'll start from the bottom.

754
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:49,670
I'll start from the bottom.

755
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:49,850
I'll start from the bottom.

756
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:50,851
Wow.

757
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:53,890
Wow.

758
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:54,891
Wow.

759
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,550
Wow.

760
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:57,950
I like the way you touch it.

761
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,330
Wow!

762
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:01,331
Is it a pitch pipe?

763
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,390
Wow!

764
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,690
Wow!

765
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,290
Are you purring?

766
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,850
Wow!

767
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,050
Wow! It feels good.

768
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,030
It feels good.

769
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,950


770
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,130
You didn't make such a voice when I did it.

771
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,270
No, I didn't.

772
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,190
Are you good at it?

773
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,750
You are better than me.

774
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,010
You have a very erotic face.

775
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,790
I didn't know you have such a face.

776
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,140
You look like you were put in a safe.

777
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,510
I think it will be bigger.

778
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,750
It's not like this yet.

779
00:33:52,751 --> 00:34:04,490
I'm going to show you my boobs.

780
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,590
I'm not going to let you touch it yet.

781
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,790
You want to touch it, don't you?

782
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,530
It's soft, so imagine it.

783
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:17,210
What's wrong, Tachibana-san?

784
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,970
Tachibana-san, you have a nice boob.

785
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,150
You must be envious.

786
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,230
You're always daydreaming, aren't you?

787
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,070
I'm not daydreaming.

788
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,510
You're just glancing around.

789
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,410
I'm not glancing around.

790
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,390
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

791
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,390
Icchan, you can't do that!

792
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,250
Wait a minute!

793
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,590
Too fast! I can't do it.

794
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,490


795
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,210
Why are you so fast?

796
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,370
You should work faster.

797
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,770
I can't do it.

798
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,650
Why are you so fast?

799
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,850
You can't do it, Icchan.

800
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,430
I can't do it.

801
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,010
Next!

802
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,930
Show us!

803
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,270
I'm under a lot of pressure!

804
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,610
Show us!

805
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,170
I'll make the best voice!

806
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,310
That's good!

807
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,810
He's the type to do it from the bottom.

808
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,530
Haruka!

809
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,790
Wow, you are so sexy!

810
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,690
It feels good, doesn't it?

811
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,550
Eat it!

812
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,490
Eat it!

813
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,850
What's the matter?

814
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,050
Wow, you are so sexy!

815
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,290
You are so sexy!

816
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,210
Wow, you are so sexy!

817
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,350
Wow, you are so sexy!

818
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,790
What are you doing?

819
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,230
What's going on?

820
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:15,030
Wow! It's amazing!

821
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,190
It's touching!

822
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,630
What are you touching?

823
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,590
It's touching!

824
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:31,591
What is it?

825
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,870
I can't believe it.

826
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,410
What is it?

827
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,090
What are you so happy about?

828
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,330
I want to touch it, too.

829
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,810
Wow!

830
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,270
Wow!

831
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:00,630
Wow! What is
this? It's so erotic.

832
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,850


833
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,590
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

834
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,910
No, no, no!

835
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,610
No, no, no!

836
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,690
No? No? No?

837
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,050
Ah!

838
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,990
He can't get it out.

839
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,370
Did you try to get it out?

840
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,810
I can't get it out.

841
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:23,811
I don't think so.

842
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,230
I haven't seen it.

843
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,570
You haven't?

844
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,650
I want to see it.

845
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,790
Excuse me.

846
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,790
You are so mean.

847
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,710
You are so mean.

848
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,350
How can you remember that?

849
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,351
Wow!

850
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,090
It's a big one!

851
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,690
Wow!

852
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,110
It's a big one!

853
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,090
Wow!

854
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:00,091
It's a big one!

855
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,250
Wow!

856
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,550
It's amazing!

857
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,030
How is it?

858
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,630
Wow!

859
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:17,510
Oh, no!

860
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,870
Oh, no!

861
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,650
Why?

862
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
Hold on!

863
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,790
Oh, no!

864
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,350
Oh, no!

865
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,710
Oh, no!

866
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,510
Oh, no!

867
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,350
What's coming out?

868
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,790
Oh, no!

869
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,250
Oh, no!

870
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,530
Oh, no!

871
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,410
Oh, no! It's hot.

872
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:44,411


873
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,190
Do you want to lick it?

874
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,270
Do you want to lick it together?

875
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,190
You are so erotic.

876
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,530
It's not easy to lick
because you two are big.

877
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:07,590
It's easy to lick.

878
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,970
Touch her breast.

879
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,670
I'm just touching you.

880
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,470
How do you feel?

881
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,710
You are amazing!

882
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,510
You don't have time to rest.

883
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,350
Look!

884
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,790
Look at Shino's boobs!

885
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Look!

886
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,030
It's soft, isn't it?

887
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,290
How do you feel? It's soft.

888
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,770


889
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,330
It's soft?

890
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,650
Why are you acting
like a child? It's true.

891
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,950
Don't touch it.

892
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,510
Touch it a lot.

893
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
It's cool.

894
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,390
No, no, no.

895
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,550
You can't! You can't!

896
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:13,050
Becca, no!

897
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,070
You can't!

898
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,310
You can't, right?

899
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,450
Did you put up with it?

900
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,630
What about you, Becca?

901
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,070
What about your boobs?

902
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,570
You're so flirty!

903
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,370
Wow!

904
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,410
It's a big one!

905
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:41,850
It's big! Yes, yes.

906
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,810
Touch this side, too.

907
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,970
Wow!

908
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,250
Wow!

909
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,710
It's so plump!

910
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,650
It's so plump! It feels good.

911
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,950
It's stuck in your boob.

912
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,790
It's already stuck.

913
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,550
Wow!

914
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,870
Wow!

915
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,730
It's a bubble wrap!

916
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,310
Do you like bubble wrap?

917
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,170
Do you like bubble wrap?

918
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:26,550
Can you feel softness?

919
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,570
Wow!

920
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,350
You like bubble wrap! Oh, I see.

921
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:34,910


922
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,550
You are a country boy.

923
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,030
But you don't let go of your boobs.

924
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,230
You love boobs.

925
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,130
You are a boob-adventurer.

926
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,490
Really?

927
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,130
Wow!

928
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,210
Wow!

929
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,950
You are like a baby.

930
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:09,990
I want to do it, too.

931
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,950
I want to do it, too.

932
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:15,850
Which one do you want to do?

933
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:18,770
Which one do you want to do?

934
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,190
This one?

935
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,010
Let's do this one.

936
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,510
Do you want to
lick it? Like this.

937
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,230


938
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,230
Wow!

939
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,390
Wow!

940
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,610
You look so happy.

941
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,910
It's a baby.

942
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:45,350
It's a baby.

943
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:46,351
I feel so good.

944
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,010
I feel so good.

945
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,170
It's like a baby.

946
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,590
It's so painful.

947
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,350
It's so painful.

948
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,990
It's like a baby.

949
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:06,650
I'm so happy to see you.

950
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,690
I'm so happy to see you.

951
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,130
Did you try it on?

952
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,630
You love it, don't you?

953
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,810
How do you like it?

954
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,030
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

955
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,370


956
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,730
Wow, it's really tight.

957
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,910
Wow, it's really tight.

958
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:33,330
I think I'm going to suffocate.

959
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,870
Wow, amazing!

960
00:43:42,775 --> 00:43:45,230
Teimo, I love your boobs!

961
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,310
You're still pooping.

962
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,570
Oh, no.

963
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
It's still hard.

964
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,630
It's hard.

965
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,370
It's gross.

966
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,510
What?

967
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,610
Do you want more? Oh, no.

968
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,570


969
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,630
Do you want more? No, no, no.

970
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,870
No, no, no.

971
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,890
No, no, no.

972
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,190
Oh, no, no, no.

973
00:44:23,191 --> 00:44:24,930


974
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,770
I want to show you the talents of the
organizers of this sun dance ceremony!

975
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:43,130
This is the eve of the event.

976
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:48,190
Let's dance together!

977
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:51,010
I want to do it, too.

978
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,210
I want to do it, too.

979
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,490
Wait, wait, wait.

980
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,190
No, no, no.

981
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,690
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

982
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,390
Wow!

983
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,510
It's dirty!

984
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,690
What's this?

985
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,450
It's all over the place.

986
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,230
It's all over the place.

987
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,990
It's all over the place.

988
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,230
What's going on?

989
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,230
What's going on?

990
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,390
What's going on?

991
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:36,391
Wow!

992
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,570
Wow!

993
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,230
What? What? What?

994
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,350
Wow!

995
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,550
What? It's not coming out?

996
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,070
It's not coming out?

997
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,630
It's already out!

998
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,730
It's so ugly!

999
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,550
Wow! It's the worst.

1000
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,190


1001
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,550
It's so ugly!

1002
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,170
It's not strong enough.

1003
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,710
It's too early.

1004
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Let's drink again.

1005
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:17,830
Don't you go to bed yet?

1006
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,130
We don't go to bed.

1007
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,610
We are going to sleep.

1008
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,630
We are going to sleep.

1009
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,430
Are you trying to
sleep? I drank a lot.

1010
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,470


1011
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,250
You are sleepy because you went to bed.

1012
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,850
No, no, no.

1013
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:36,891
You didn't look like that.

1014
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,730
You did.

1015
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:44,546
Does Hayashi have a girlfriend?

1016
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,310
A girlfriend?

1017
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,711
He doesn't have a girlfriend anymore.

1018
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,170
That's true.

1019
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,810
I heard that.

1020
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,850
Why is Hayashi so unpopular?

1021
00:46:58,851 --> 00:46:59,851
I don't think so.

1022
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,090
Why?

1023
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,530
It's because it smells like money.

1024
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,870
Isn't it too much?

1025
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,490
Don't you rely on her?

1026
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:06,590
No.

1027
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,930
I don't rely on her.

1028
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,070
I see.

1029
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,810
Have you ever been in a relationship?

1030
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,290
Well, maybe a little bit.

1031
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,630
You're strong.

1032
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,570
How much do you rely on her?

1033
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,630
That's a secret.

1034
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:22,930
What?

1035
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:23,931
What do you mean?

1036
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,890
Are you hiding it? No, no, no.

1037
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:25,950


1038
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Wow! No, I'm not.

1039
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,651
You're a magician.

1040
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,370
No, I'm not.

1041
00:47:31,371 --> 00:47:31,710
Are you a magician? No, I'm not.

1042
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,330


1043
00:47:33,545 --> 00:47:34,670
Then, you're not.

1044
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:35,950
You're not yet.

1045
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,210
Well, I'm not.

1046
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,770
Why do you feel
like that? That's right.

1047
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,370


1048
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:40,910
It doesn't make sense.

1049
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:41,850
It's suspicious.

1050
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:42,710
It's suspicious.

1051
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:43,590
What?

1052
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,590
Well, it's okay.

1053
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:46,890
Why? I'm curious.

1054
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,090


1055
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,050
Why?

1056
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,270
We got along so well.

1057
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,030
Yes.

1058
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,770
Yes.

1059
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,310
Are you drinking? Yes, I am.

1060
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,290


1061
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,790
Drink up! Yes, I am.

1062
00:48:01,935 --> 00:48:03,070
Wait a minute.

1063
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,670


1064
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,610
What's wrong?

1065
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,050
You are sleeping with
your penis on your pillow.

1066
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,090
I want to sleep with my penis on my pillow.

1067
00:48:18,091 --> 00:48:19,291
I feel like I want to do that.

1068
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,730
What? Wait a minute.

1069
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,870


1070
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,330
What's wrong with you?

1071
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,150
Are you in love with me?

1072
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,050
What? No, no, no.

1073
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,650
No, I'm not.

1074
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:31,690
You're right.

1075
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:32,691


1076
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,750
My boyfriend's eyes are big.

1077
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,470
Is that so?

1078
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,090
What?

1079
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,810
You like big eyes.

1080
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,310
No, no, no.

1081
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,950
What? What? What?

1082
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,710
Wait, wait, wait.

1083
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,210
Can't you listen to
your senpai? Wait.

1084
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:51,870


1085
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,750
Wait, wait, wait.

1086
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,410
What?

1087
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,170
What are you doing?

1088
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,690
Why aren't you wearing
your panties? No, no, no.

1089
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:01,950


1090
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,090
Why?

1091
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,581
Why aren't you wearing your panties?

1092
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,551
Why aren't you wearing your panties?

1093
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,541
Were you expecting
something? No, I wasn't.

1094
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,450
I'm sorry.

1095
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:12,451


1096
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,070
No?

1097
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,030
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,670
Wait, wait, wait.

1099
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,830
No, no, no.

1100
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,150
Wait, wait, wait.

1101
00:49:36,151 --> 00:49:37,151
What are you
doing? Wait a minute.

1102
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,951
What? Wait a minute.

1103
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,030
Wait a minute.

1104
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,630
Wait a minute.

1105
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,210
Wait a minute.

1106
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:49,550


1107
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,170
What?

1108
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,070
What are you waiting
for? It's rubbing.

1109
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,270
It's rubbing.

1110
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,750


1111
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,910
It's rubbing?

1112
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,190
What are you
doing? I got a chair.

1113
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:02,890


1114
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,310
Is it OK?

1115
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,050
Is it really a chair?

1116
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:08,750
It's comfortable to sit on.

1117
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,810
Can I touch it?

1118
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,910
Can I touch it?

1119
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,870
Has it started?

1120
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,290
No, it hasn't started yet.

1121
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,150
Has it started?

1122
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,410
What's going on?

1123
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,870
I can't move my hips.

1124
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,190
It's different.

1125
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,970
I can't move my hips.

1126
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,650
It's a chair.

1127
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,030
A chair? Yes, yes, yes.

1128
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:31,910
Hey, hey, hey.

1129
00:50:31,935 --> 00:50:33,170


1130
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:39,270
What? What?

1131
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:48,590
Are you really just
sitting? Yes, I am.

1132
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,251
I'm just sitting.

1133
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,070
Really?

1134
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:54,710
Yes.

1135
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:55,670
Hey.

1136
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,270
Wow!

1137
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,350
It's in there!

1138
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,570
What? You found out?

1139
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,050
No way!

1140
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:03,190
No way!

1141
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,710
How can it fit in there?

1142
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:05,910
It's so big!

1143
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,110
Wow!

1144
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,270
How did it get in there?

1145
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,610
How did it get in
there? I didn't know.

1146
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,070


1147
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,270
Look!

1148
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,730
It's in there!

1149
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,150
It's in there!

1150
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,510
It's so big!

1151
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,511
It's so big!

1152
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,810
Wow!

1153
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,690
What's the name? No, I don't.

1154
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,190


1155
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:27,770
You don't? No, I don't.

1156
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:28,250


1157
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,930
Are you sure?

1158
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,090
I don't want to put him
in such a big house.

1159
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,290
What?

1160
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,470
You don't?

1161
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,090
He's my boyfriend.

1162
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,950
He's your boyfriend.

1163
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,930
He's your boyfriend.

1164
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:45,670
He's my boyfriend.

1165
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:45,790
I love him.

1166
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,310
I love him.

1167
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,730
Let him move.

1168
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,750
Wow, you look so much better.

1169
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,210
Young people are amazing.

1170
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,030
You're right.

1171
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,130
You're so strong.

1172
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,530
How many times can you do it in a day?

1173
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,870
I can do it as many times as I want.

1174
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,150
Let's see how many
times you can do it today.

1175
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,630
You haven't had a
girlfriend for a long time.

1176
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,210
That's right.

1177
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:23,771
It's been a while since we've seen you.

1178
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,030
You look like a treasure hunter.

1179
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,650
I'm so happy.

1180
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,850
I'm so happy.

1181
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,490
I can see your face.

1182
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,190
I'm so happy.

1183
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,380
What are you doing?

1184
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,470
I'm changing my clothes.

1185
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,250
What?

1186
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:46,251
You're in the way.

1187
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:47,930
What?

1188
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,140
What?

1189
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,790
Are you going back to the castle?

1190
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,350
Are you sure?

1191
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,550
Are you sure?

1192
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,250
Hurry up!

1193
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,930
Don't make a girl wait.

1194
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:05,650
Don't look at me like that.

1195
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,230
What is it? It's a scab.

1196
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,740
It's a scab.

1197
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:24,850
It's a scab.

1198
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,250


1199
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,370
It's a scab, isn't it?

1200
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:28,550
It's a scab, isn't it?

1201
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:28,630
It's a scab, isn't it?

1202
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:29,630
I can feel the pressure.

1203
00:53:29,631 --> 00:53:29,750
I can feel the pressure.

1204
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:31,210
I can see your shoulders.

1205
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,850
I can see them.

1206
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,450
Wow, amazing.

1207
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,710
I can see your chest.

1208
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,330
Your shoulders are amazing.

1209
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,510
It feels good.

1210
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,950
You look so happy.

1211
00:53:54,555 --> 00:53:55,650
You look so happy.

1212
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,150
It feels good.

1213
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:00,750
You have to move more.

1214
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,490
Oh, no.

1215
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,430
You have to move more.

1216
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,590
Oh, no.

1217
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:09,910
You have to move faster.

1218
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:11,910
It doesn't feel good.

1219
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,830
Oh, no.

1220
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,890
It feels good.

1221
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,870
It feels good.

1222
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,710
Oh, no.

1223
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:20,711
You are moving so fast.

1224
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:22,950
Oh, no.

1225
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,550
Oh, no.

1226
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,510
I can see your eyes.

1227
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,430
I feel good.

1228
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,160
I feel good, too.

1229
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,530
Wait a minute.

1230
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,450
I feel good.

1231
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,570
I feel good.

1232
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,450
Only Ayashi doesn't feel good.

1233
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:50,310
I feel good.

1234
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,150
Wow!

1235
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,230
I've never reached this far.

1236
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,250
Wow!

1237
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,530
Wow! It feels good.

1238
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,850


1239
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:21,150
How do you feel?

1240
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,210
How do you feel?

1241
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,370
Do you feel good?

1242
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,490
It's been a long time.

1243
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,310
Look this way.

1244
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,310
Oh, I see.

1245
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,230
It's amazing.

1246
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,150
It's amazing.

1247
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,250
I feel good.

1248
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,230
What?

1249
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,470
What? What? What?

1250
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,290
What?

1251
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:52,430
What is this?

1252
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:56,850
Wow!

1253
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,690
Can you see it?

1254
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,330
Wow!

1255
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,290
It's so big!

1256
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,490
I can barely see it.

1257
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:16,250
I'm sorry, but you are crying a lot.

1258
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,670
It's OK.

1259
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,430
Do you want to
cry? I want to cry.

1260
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,750
It's OK.

1261
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,910


1262
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,490
Wow!

1263
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,550
It feels good!

1264
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,090
Does it feel good?

1265
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,670
Wow!

1266
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,530
Wow!

1267
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,490
Wow!

1268
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,850
It's like a push and pull game!

1269
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,310
Wow!

1270
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,650
It's amazing!

1271
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,550
We're all on it!

1272
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,130
Wow!

1273
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,190
Wow!

1274
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:11,191
Wow!

1275
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,590
It feels so good!

1276
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,230
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

1277
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,650


1278
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:47,430
I want to see your face.

1279
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,190
I want to see your face.

1280
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,170
Your face?

1281
00:57:56,171 --> 00:58:01,530
I want to see your face.

1282
00:58:01,531 --> 00:58:02,531
It's not fair.

1283
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,506
You'll get bored if you only
play with cabbage, won't you?

1284
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,230
I think the big one is better.

1285
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,530
The big one feels good,
doesn't it? Yes, it does.

1286
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:13,250


1287
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,690
Does it feel good?

1288
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:17,410
How do you feel?

1289
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,710
It feels really good.

1290
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,170
It feels good.

1291
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,690
Wow, there are a lot of them.

1292
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,290
Wow, there are a lot of them.

1293
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,250
They are so big.

1294
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,730
Can you see them?

1295
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,330
Can you see them? Oh, no.

1296
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:46,730


1297
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,110
What is it?

1298
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:49,730
What is it? Wow, amazing.

1299
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,110
Wow, amazing.

1300
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,430
Wow, amazing.

1301
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,491
Wow!

1302
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,050
Wow!

1303
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:02,051
I'm in the water.

1304
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,070
Wow!

1305
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:05,790
Wow!

1306
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,390
It feels good!

1307
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,290
I'm so happy!

1308
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,350
It feels good!

1309
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,170
Wow!

1310
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,110
Ai-chan!

1311
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,230
Wow!

1312
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,750
It feels good!

1313
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:45,630
It feels good!

1314
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:50,090
Ai-chan! It's freezing.

1315
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,450
So creepy.

1316
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,530


1317
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:03,590
Ouch, my stomach hurts.

1318
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:19,130
Oh, it feels good.

1319
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,230
What's wrong? Why did you get up?

1320
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:23,231
What is it?

1321
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,470
Do you want me to touch you?

1322
01:00:33,985 --> 01:00:37,390
Oh, it feels good.

1323
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:39,930
Oh, it's great.

1324
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:50,130
Oh, it feels good.

1325
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,230
I'm sorry.

1326
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,410
I'm sorry.

1327
01:00:59,130 --> 01:00:59,690
I'm sorry.

1328
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:00,691
I'm sorry.

1329
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,670
I'm sorry.

1330
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,350
You are so busy.

1331
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,030
You are so busy.

1332
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,910
You don't have time to rest.

1333
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,350
Move him more.

1334
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,970
You can do it faster,
can't you? More, more.

1335
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,350
It feels good.

1336
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,810


1337
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,790
Hayashi, do you
feel good? Yes, I do.

1338
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,570


1339
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,970
It's been a long time since you
had a bath, so you feel good.

1340
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:00,490
Yes, I do.

1341
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,610
Wow, you feel good.

1342
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,870
Wow, you feel good.

1343
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:18,950
Hayashi, more, more, more, more.

1344
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:20,730
It's getting intense.

1345
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:25,490
It's coming out!

1346
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,530
It's coming out!

1347
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,330
It's so cute!

1348
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,990
It's coming out!

1349
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,510
It's so cute! I'm so nervous.

1350
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,310
Don't worry.

1351
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,110
I'm so nervous.

1352
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,330
I'm so nervous.

1353
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,770


1354
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,870
You are sweating a lot.

1355
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,330
I'm sweating a lot.

1356
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:06,150
I'm sweating a lot.

1357
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,550
I'm sweating a lot.

1358
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,830
I'm sweating a lot.

1359
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,190
I'm going to lick you.

1360
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,750
Wait a minute.

1361
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,550
It's still wet, isn't it?

1362
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:35,890
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

1363
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,290
I'm going to put it in your mouth.

1364
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,310
It's still a long way to go.

1365
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,660
It's going in.

1366
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,350
Are you looking at it?

1367
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,070
Look at where it's going in.

1368
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,550
Can you see it? It's big.

1369
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,350
It's big.

1370
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,710
It's in.

1371
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:06,660
It's too big.

1372
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,710


1373
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,030
It's the first time I've ever
seen something like this.

1374
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,430
It's too big.

1375
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,150
Is it big?

1376
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,750
It's not moving at all.

1377
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,170
I'm afraid I'm going to die.

1378
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,370
It's not moving yet.

1379
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,010
It's not moving yet.

1380
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:38,710
It's too big.

1381
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,760
I'm so happy.

1382
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,900
I'm so happy.

1383
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,040
You're so happy, aren't you?

1384
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,460
You must be happy.

1385
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,020
I'm going to cry.

1386
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:06,730
I'm so happy.

1387
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,570
You're so cute.

1388
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,100
I'm so happy.

1389
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,070
Ah, it's scary.

1390
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,590
How do you feel,
Hayashi? It's scary.

1391
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:23,570


1392
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,050
How do you feel,
Hayashi? Calm down.

1393
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,250


1394
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,350
How do you feel?

1395
01:05:27,351 --> 01:05:28,606
Which one do you feel better, Hayashi?

1396
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,070
Why are you asking me?

1397
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,150
Which one?

1398
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:31,570
Which one?

1399
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,750
Which one?

1400
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,410
It's me, isn't it?

1401
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,230
It's me, isn't it?

1402
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:37,290
Which one?

1403
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,510
Do you want me to be
more violent? I'm scared.

1404
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:40,890


1405
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:45,030
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! I feel sick.

1406
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:46,450
I feel sick.

1407
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,440
You are too big.

1408
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,120
You have a big body.

1409
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,120
I have a cramp in my back.

1410
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,200
How can you remember that?

1411
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,140
I don't remember at all.

1412
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,500
I don't remember at all.

1413
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,080
That's because you are old.

1414
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,440
I'm so happy!

1415
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:25,440
I'm so happy!

1416
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,860
I'm so happy!

1417
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:35,120
I'm so happy!

1418
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,140
How is it?

1419
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,460
You cleaned up and
put it in the box, Hayashi.

1420
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,180
How is it?

1421
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,080
How is it?

1422
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,560
How does your juice taste?

1423
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:46,561
Are you a baby?

1424
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,460
You are so cute!

1425
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,480
You are so cute!

1426
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,080
It feels so good!

1427
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,620
You are the best!

1428
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,280
I am going to fall down.

1429
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,500
You have white eyes!

1430
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:24,840
Look at his mouth.

1431
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,520
He has a big mouth.

1432
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,160
It feels good.

1433
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,700
Which one do you
like? I feel good.

1434
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:38,040


1435
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,280
Which one do you like?

1436
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,620
Which one do you like?

1437
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,220
I like this one.

1438
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,400
You don't mind? I'm so sorry.

1439
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,500


1440
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,670
How do you feel?

1441
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,520
Do you want me to stretch
your neck more? I'm sorry.

1442
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:26,761
How do you feel? I feel good.

1443
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,640
I feel good.

1444
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,420


1445
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,240
How do you feel? I feel good.

1446
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,940
I feel good.

1447
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:44,980
I feel good.

1448
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,040
I feel good.

1449
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,721
Can we see that?

1450
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,240
Wow!

1451
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,460
OMG!

1452
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,340
OMG!

1453
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,180
Go, go!

1454
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,750
Wow!

1455
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,820
She's crying!

1456
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,260
OMG!

1457
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,660
She's really crying!

1458
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,520
That was too much!

1459
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,000
That was really
intense! You are crying.

1460
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:16,300


1461
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,300
You are still crying.

1462
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:20,820
Just this one.

1463
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,740
You are crying a lot.

1464
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,660
You are crying a lot.

1465
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,120
Oh, you are crying! I'm sorry.

1466
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,340


1467
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,640
I'm sorry I'm crying.

1468
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,540
I'm happy.

1469
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,460
I'm happy.

1470
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,300
I'm happy.

1471
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:43,060
I'm happy.

1472
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:44,061
I'm happy.

1473
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,550
Do you want me to
put it in? Yes, put it in.

1474
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,010


1475
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,570
OK, I'll put it in.

1476
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,470
Do you want to
put it in? It's big.

1477
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,150


1478
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,550
Wow, it's so big.

1479
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:19,870
It's huge, isn't it?

1480
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,470
Amazing!

1481
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:25,010
It's so big!

1482
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:38,970
Oh, my god!

1483
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,090
Oh, my god! It's too big!

1484
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,030
Oh, my god! It's too big!

1485
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:57,110
Oh, it's intense!

1486
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:16,890
I'm going to cry.

1487
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:28,040
I'm going to cry.

1488
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:35,000
I'm going to cry.

1489
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,040
What's wrong with you?

1490
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,860
What's wrong with you?

1491
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,970
You have a lot of hair on your waist.

1492
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,530
You have a lot of hair on your waist.

1493
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,810
Look behind you.

1494
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:00,150
Oh, my God.

1495
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:04,470
Oh, my God.

1496
01:12:04,471 --> 01:12:05,590
Are you okay? It's no edge.

1497
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,050
Oh, my God.

1498
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:11,430


1499
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,290
You're so good at moving.

1500
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,190
Oh, my God.

1501
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,250
You're shaking.

1502
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,850
How far are you in?

1503
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,730
Are you in? You're shaking.

1504
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:45,000


1505
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,540
Wow, she is strong! I feel good.

1506
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,000


1507
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,700
You are grombling.

1508
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,540
Oh, awesome!

1509
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,840
Yes!

1510
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:07,820
Oh!

1511
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:08,821
Oh!

1512
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:09,520
Oh! He's moving.

1513
01:13:09,521 --> 01:13:11,100


1514
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,700
He's moving twice! It's amazing.

1515
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,100
It's amazing.

1516
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,700


1517
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,270
Hayashi, you should move too.

1518
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,350
Come here.

1519
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,110
She is crying.

1520
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:53,111
Oh, my God.

1521
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,240
Oh, my God.

1522
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,520
She is cold.

1523
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,600
Did you get a cold, too?

1524
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,920
Yes.

1525
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,820
Oh, my God.

1526
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,460
Oh, my God.

1527
01:14:14,461 --> 01:14:15,060
Well, that's great.

1528
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,720
Oh, my God.

1529
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,840
That's a good feeling.

1530
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,550
I feel so good.

1531
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:36,551
I feel so good.

1532
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,110
Oh, no.

1533
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,170
Let's go.

1534
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,810
Let's go.

1535
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,330
Oh, she's gone.

1536
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,730
Where is she?

1537
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,070
She's coming out.

1538
01:14:58,071 --> 01:14:59,210
It's coming out so much!

1539
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,310
How many times?

1540
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,330
It's coming out so much!

1541
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,430
Are you okay?

1542
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,890
It's coming out so much!

1543
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,850
It's coming out so much!

1544
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,770
It's coming out so much!

1545
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:14,830
It's coming out so much!

1546
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:15,831
It's so sticky!

1547
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,350
It's so sticky!

1548
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,410
It's so sticky! I'm going to.

1549
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,970
..

1550
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,810
I'm going to go last!

1551
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:25,590
You're a bird!

1552
01:15:25,591 --> 01:15:25,970
It's a bird, isn't it?

1553
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:29,130
It's a bird, so I'm going
to put it on my eyes.

1554
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,590
What are you going to show me?

1555
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:35,770
Don't expect too much.

1556
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,530
I'm scared.

1557
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,050
I'm going to give you a heart.

1558
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:41,130
Did you find out?

1559
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:45,030
I'm going to take it off.

1560
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,190
It's in your ear.

1561
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,710
Is it in my ear? Let me see.

1562
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:50,950


1563
01:15:55,740 --> 01:16:02,330
I'm going to push myself down
and show you my strongest Kijoi.

1564
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,770
Senpai, please show us.

1565
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,170
I'm not your senpai at all.

1566
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,150
Here I go.

1567
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,151
Here we go.

1568
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:26,230
It's so big.

1569
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:27,850
It's big, isn't it?

1570
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,970
Wow.

1571
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,890
How do you feel?

1572
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,030
Wow.

1573
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:32,410
I can't believe it.

1574
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:34,790
I can't believe it.

1575
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,130
Wow.

1576
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,570
It feels so good.

1577
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:45,910
Oh, it's great.

1578
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,990
Oh, it feels so good.

1579

01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,570
Oh, it's great.

1581
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:03,470
Oh, it's great.

1582
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:22,750
Oh, my God!

1583
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:31,900
Oh, my God!

1584
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,720
Wow!

1585
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:43,380
I'm going to throw up.

1586
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,940
I'm going to throw up.

1587
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:57,700
I feel great.

1588
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,720
Ah, it's so nice.

1589
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,100
It feels so good.

1590
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,320
It feels so good.

1591
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:20,800
It feels so good.

1592
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:30,900
I'm going to throw up.

1593
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
It feels so good!

1594
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,660
Aoi-chan!

1595
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:52,200
Aoi-chan!

1596
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,240
Aoi-chan!

1597
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,700
Aoi-chan!

1598
01:18:56,701 --> 01:18:57,701
Yes!

1599
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:14,010
Oh, it feels good.

1600
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,390
Oh, it feels so good.

1601
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,430
Oh, it feels so good.

1602
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,370
Oh, it feels so good when I rub my back.

1603
01:19:26,055 --> 01:19:27,750
Oh, it feels so good.

Oh, it's cool.

01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,810
Oh, it's cold.

1609
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:58,750
I'm going to cry.

1610
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:07,330
It's ticklish.

1611
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,250
You have a very good face.

1612
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,990
You have a big heart.

1613
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,450
It's ticklish.

1614
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:23,451
I'm sick.

1615
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:25,890
I'm sick.

1616
01:20:27,765 --> 01:20:29,190
I'm sick.

1617
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,230
I'm sick.

I'm sick.

1627
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:50,130
I'm sick.

1628
01:20:54,650 --> 01:21:00,770
Wow, it feels so good.

How do you feel?

How do you feel?

1639
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:05,900
How do you feel? I'm so happy.

1653
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,240
Go, go, go!

1654
01:22:47,241 --> 01:22:48,780
Go, go, go!

1655
01:22:50,985 --> 01:22:52,500
Oh, no! It came out again!

1656
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,600
Did it come out again?

1657
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,000
It's so big!

1658
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,720
What?

1659
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:00,620
What?

1660
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,780
Which one is it?

1661
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,680
Wow!

1662
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,440
Wow!

1663
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,040
There are so many!

1664
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,041
So many!

1665
01:23:08,305 --> 01:23:09,520
It's overflowing!

1671
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,660
Can you still do it?

1672
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:26,400
I can't do it yet.

1673
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,940
It's amazing.

1674
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,180
The taste of the spirit of the spirit.

1675
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,520
I'm so happy.

1676
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,800
It's unfair.

1677
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,800
I can't do it anymore.

1678
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:44,960
I can't do it anymore.

1679
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,440
I can't do it anymore.

1680
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,480
Well, we sweat a lot.

1681
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,140
Let's take a bath together.

1682
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,600
I agree.

1683
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,860
Let's take a bath together.

1684
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Let's go.

1685
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,640
It's OK. Let's take a bath.

1686
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,830
Which way? Hurry up.

1687
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,010


1688
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:19,950
It's been a long time since I've been here.

1689
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,950
It's so dirty here.

1690
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:25,290
You have to clean it up.

1691
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,990
It's so noisy.

1692
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,000
It's not good.

1693
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,060
How do you feel?

1694
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,540
How do you feel?

1695
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:51,660
I was washed by my senior.

1696
01:24:51,661 --> 01:24:53,160
Thank you so much for washing me.

1697
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,540
You should be grateful.

1698
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,420
That's right.

1699
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,660
Great.

1700
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,360
How do you feel? Great.

1701
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,400
What's up?

1702
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,020
What's up?

1703
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,200
He's getting bigger.

1704
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:30,560
Wow, he's standing up.

1705
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:33,560
He's really energetic.

1706
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:40,140
He's really energetic.

1707
01:25:40,141 --> 01:25:40,920
He's really energetic.

1708
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:45,020
Wow, amazing.

1709
01:25:45,021 --> 01:25:46,700
How do you feel? Good.

1710
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,220
Great.

1711
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,900


1712
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,060
It's getting warmer.

1713
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,660
Great.

1714
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,680
How do you feel? Great.

1715
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,800


1716
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,440
How do you feel?

1717
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:13,441
Can you feel it?

1718
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:14,820
Wow!

1719
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,080
Wow!

1720
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,680
Wow!

1721
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,200
Wow!

1722
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,440

I didn't know you liked
your buttocks so much.

1830
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,100
It's so cool.

It feels so good.

1864
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:30,130
It's worth working hard.

1865
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:33,650
It's true.

1866
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:38,750
I don't know why Hayashi is doing his best.

1867
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,520
It's tough.

1868
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,050
I'm not doing my best.

1869
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:45,770
I'm sorry.

1870
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:47,150
I'm not doing my best.

1871
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:48,410
It's true.

1872
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:48,910
I'm sorry.

1873
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:50,410
Do your best more.

1874
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,650
Yes.

1875
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,300
It's true.

1876
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,390
I have to do my best.

1877
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,480
Why don't you take a bath?

1878
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,700
What?

1879
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:09,200
Oh, I made him drink the water.

1880
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:10,020
Did you?

1881
01:35:10,021 --> 01:35:11,021
Yes.

1882
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,300
Wow, he is smiling.

1883
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,081
Why did you make him
drink the water? I know.

1884
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,400


1885
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,980
He was sensitive.

1886
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,560
I know.

1887
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,740
He is still sensitive.

1888
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,960
He is getting up.

1889
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,580
He is getting up.

1890
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,260
He is getting up.

1891
01:35:46,261 --> 01:35:47,261
He is getting up a lot.

1892
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,680
He couldn't get up a while ago.

1893
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:54,940
He couldn't get up.

1894
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,740
They are doing it together.

1895
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,740
It's getting bigger and bigger.

1896
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,200
It's clean now.

1897
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,500
Yes, it is.

1898
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:32,540
It doesn't smell.

1899
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,840
I was surprised.

1900
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,260
It's true. It's hard.

1901
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:43,980
Yes, it is.

1902
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,560
It's getting bigger and bigger.

1903
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:46,160
It's amazing.

1904
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,660
It's getting bigger and bigger.

1905
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,320
Do you feel good?

1906
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,840
It feels good, doesn't it?

1907
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,780
I want to lick it, too.

1908
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:15,760
Oh, it feels good.

1909
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,940
The sound is erotic, isn't it?

1910
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,820
It's dripping, isn't
it? It's amazing.

1911
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,920
It's amazing.

1912
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:37,980


1913
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:46,760
Who feels the best? I do.

1914
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200


1915
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:49,960
Who is it?

1916
01:37:49,961 --> 01:37:50,961
It's been a long time.

1917
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:52,320
Who is it?

1918
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,440
I don't want to decide.

1919
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:55,780
Why?

1920
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,000
I don't want to.

1921
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:58,860
Decide.

1922
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,580
Saki-chan.

1923
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,860
Does it feel good?

1924
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,100
Do you like
Saki-chan? I don't know.

1925
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:11,580


1926
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,320
You don't know?

1927
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,540
You like all of them, don't you?

1928
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:17,160
So you feel all of them.

1929
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,020
I'm so sorry, I got too
emotional and went crazy.

1930
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,020
Really? What does that mean?

1931
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,300
What does that mean?

1932
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,000
What does that mean?

1933
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:31,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1934
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:32,980
I'm sorry.

1935
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:34,880
I love you.

1936
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,860
I love you.

1937
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,160
Are your boobs being patted?

1938
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:50,420
Your nipples are curled up.

1939
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,400
You feel it, don't
you? I can feel it.

1940
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,680


1941
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,300
How do you feel? I feel great.

1942
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,360
It's amazing, isn't it?

1943
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,420
Does it feel good?

1944
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,980
It's a little scary.

1945
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:07,720
It's a little hard, isn't it, Naoko?

1946
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,920
It's a little hard, isn't it?

1947
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:13,600
It's a little hard, isn't it?

1948
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:14,820
It's already full.

1949
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,300
It's full.

1950
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,120
It's fast.

1951
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,880
It's fast.

1952
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,340
It's about to burst.

1953
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,620
Ah!

1954
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:26,621
Wow!

1955
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:29,760
It's amazing!

1956
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,920
It's amazing!

1957
01:39:31,921 --> 01:39:33,080
What are you doing there?

1958
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,620
Wow!

1959
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,800
It's amazing!

1960
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,240
It's amazing, really.

1961
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,260
It makes me feel good.

1962
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,840
It's hard from the root.

1963
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,240
Really?

1964
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,720
It's amazing!

1965
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:52,721
Wow!

1966
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,220
I think it's going to
stick to your stomach.

1967
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,040
I know.

1968
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,140
It's so big.

1969
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:01,960
Wow!

1970
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,940
I'll put it on you.

1971
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,680
I'll put it on you.

1972
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:13,380
Wow!

1973
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,420
You have a big face.

1974
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,440
I think it's going to stick to your eyes.

1975
01:40:19,441 --> 01:40:20,596
Don't you think it's a
little too much? It's true.

1976
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:23,580
Don't feel it too much
that you can't drink it.

1977
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,840
I'm already drinking it.

1978
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,700
It's true.

1979
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,800
Can't you drink it? It's hot.

1980
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,580


1981
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:05,320
Do you like my breast?

1982
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:18,170
What are you
doing? It's not fair.

1983
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:23,230
I envy you.

1984
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:27,470
I envy you.

1985
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:37,091
You are so emotional.

1986
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:46,850
I feel so good.

1987
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:55,010
How's it?

1988
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:59,850
Are you crying?

1989
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,370
Hey! She's crying.

1990
01:42:02,371 --> 01:42:03,371


1991
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:06,250
What is it? She's crying.

1992
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:08,910
What's it?

1993
01:42:08,911 --> 01:42:09,911
Could it be? Wait.

1994
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,490


1995
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:12,090
What's it?

1996
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:12,970
What's it?

1997
01:42:12,971 --> 01:42:13,971
Stop!

1998
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,250
She's shaking!

1999
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:17,450
You're crying! She is crying.

2000
01:42:17,451 --> 01:42:18,451


2001
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:20,670
She cried a lot.

2002
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:24,070
She is sick.

2003
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:49,870
Aww, cute! I'm scared.

2004
01:42:49,871 --> 01:42:54,010
I'm scared.

2005
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:58,270


2006
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:11,610
You are getting more and more intense.

2007
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:14,370
You are getting more and more intense.

2008
01:43:14,371 --> 01:43:15,371
It's good.

2009
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:16,510
Ouch! Be careful.

2010
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:23,090
She's nervous.

2011
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:25,350


2012
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:28,290
Wow.

2013
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:35,610
Be careful.

2014
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:37,730
Ouch!

2015
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,670
Ouch! It's okay.

2016
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:49,990
You're doing great.

2017
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:55,430
You're doing great.

2018
01:43:58,230 --> 01:43:59,730
You're doing great.

2019
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:04,890
You're doing great.

2020
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:06,290
You're doing great.

2021
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:07,950
You're doing great.

2022
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:09,690
You're doing great.

2023
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,970
You're doing great.

2024
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:12,730
You're doing great.

2025
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:13,230
You're doing great.

2026
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:14,590
You're doing great.

2027
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:17,650
You're doing great.

2028
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,310
Oh, my back!

2029
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:26,910
Oh, my back!

2030
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:33,100
Oh, my back!

2031
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,380
Oh, my back! I feel so bad.

2032
01:44:50,381 --> 01:44:51,381
I love you.

2033
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:06,320
I love you. I love you so much.

2034
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:08,260
I love you. I love you. I love you so much.

2035
01:45:08,261 --> 01:45:21,990
I love you. I love you. I love you.

2036
01:45:21,991 --> 01:45:23,870
Too strong, too
strong Yes, she is.

2037
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:26,410


2038
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:27,570
It's very strong.

2039
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:38,310
It's bad, it's bad.

2040
01:45:38,311 --> 01:45:38,830
It's bad, it's bad.

2041
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:40,310
Feel bad?

2042
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,150
What?

2043
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:43,670
Ah.

2044
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:49,550
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah I can't breathe.

2045
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:51,430
I can't breathe.

2046
01:45:51,431 --> 01:45:52,431
Are you ok?

2047
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,800
Oh! I feel great.

2048
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,490
I feel great.

2049
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:03,690


2050
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:05,710
Oh!

2051
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:07,590
Oh!

2052
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:08,610
Oh!

2053
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:09,390
Oh!

2054
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:10,710
Oh!

2055

Oh!

2058
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:17,230
What's that sound?
Wait a minute.

2059
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:20,530
Wait a minute.

2060
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:24,670
I'm dizzy.

2061
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:32,410


2062
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:33,810
Are you dizzy?

01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:32,680
Oh, I don't like it.

2081
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,200
I feel sick.

2082
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:38,240

Wow, your mouth is full.

2090
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:28,740
It feels good.

2091

2110
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:43,200
Have you ever seen a dog
running around like that?

2111
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,920
It's so slimy!

2112
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:04,720
Wow, you're so strong.

2113

You are not only looking at
me, you are also patting me.

2135

When did you get up?

2148

It's my turn next.

2149
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:25,950
It's not fair that you
two put your seniors first.

2150
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:30,010
I didn't put mine either.

2169
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:10,050
Does it feel good?

What's left?

2223
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:27,450
The head of the family is waiting.

2224
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:30,980
Can I put it in?

2225

put it in? Oh, it hurts.

2226
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:37,720


2227
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:48,600
Man, it feels so good!

2228
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:54,560
It feels so good!

2229
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:57,900
It feels so good!

2230
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:00,660
It feels so good!

2231
01:59:00,661 --> 01:59:01,800
Oh, that feels good!

2232
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:04,700
Oh, I feel good! I'm so nervous.

2233
01:59:04,701 --> 01:59:05,701
I feel so good.

2234
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,701
It's really getting in.

2235
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,520
Oh, my God.

2236
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:13,580
Oh, no.

2237
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:16,770
It's amazing.

2238
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:18,510
It's going in,
isn't it? It's going.

2239
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:20,730
It's amazing.

2240
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:23,070
It's amazing.

2241
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,550
I feel good.

2242
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:26,930
Oh, my God.

2243
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:28,350


2244
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:32,770
I would like to be stronger.

2245
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:37,110
You are already in the bath.

2246
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:38,970
Yes, it's bath! It feels good.

2247
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:42,550


2248
01:59:48,830 --> 01:59:51,010
You are bumping your head.

2249
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:54,390
You are bumping your head.

2250
01:59:58,230 --> 02:00:13,232
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

2251
02:00:13,244 --> 02:00:28,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

2252
02:00:28,211 --> 02:00:29,330
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry You are still a baby.

2253
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,290
You are so cute.

2254
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,750
How old are you?

2255
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:35,510
You don't have to be angry.

2256
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:39,090
You love me, don't you?

2257
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:41,950
How do you feel?

2258
02:00:41,951 --> 02:00:42,951
You are so soft.

2259
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:48,010
You feel great.

2260
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:50,070
You are the best.

2261
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:53,590
You are so cute.

2262
02:00:53,591 --> 02:00:54,710
I'm scared.

2263
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:56,930
I feel so good.

2264
02:01:02,370 --> 02:01:03,430
I feel so good.

2265
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:08,350
I feel so good.

2266
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:09,930
I feel so good.

2267
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:16,190
How do you feel? I feel so good.

2268
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:22,550
It's the best!

2269
02:01:22,551 --> 02:01:25,190
It feels so good!

2270
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:26,730
It feels so good!

2271
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:33,350
It's the best!

2272
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:45,390
It's the best!

2273
02:01:46,330 --> 02:01:48,390
How do you feel?

2274
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:51,910
How do you feel?

2275
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:58,050
You are in front of me.

2276
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:00,350
You are great.

2277
02:02:08,010 --> 02:02:11,190
Go, go, go.

2278
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:14,830
Go, go, go.

2279
02:02:18,670 --> 02:02:25,170
This is the first time I've ever
seen such a cute baby in my life.

2280
02:02:25,990 --> 02:02:32,170
I'm so happy to see
such a cute baby in my life.

2281
02:02:32,171 --> 02:02:36,270
I'm so happy to see
such a cute baby in my life.

2282
02:02:36,271 --> 02:02:38,570
We are going to make
Hayashi-no-ko, aren't we?

2283
02:02:42,850 --> 02:02:45,470
It's starting again.

2284
02:02:58,780 --> 02:03:00,060
Here we go.

2285
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:05,730
Wow, it's coming out.

2286
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,520
Wow, it's amazing.

2287
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,020
Can you see it? I can't see it.

2288
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,020


2289
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,460
Wow, it's amazing.

2290
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:27,940
It's intense.

2291
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:32,160
It's amazing.

2292
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,260
You are so cute!

2293
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,760
Go! Go!

2294
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:01,200
You can do it!

2295
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:11,080
You are so cute!

2296
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:37,810
Wow! Your voice is echoing!

2297
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:39,910
Are you OK?

2298
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:44,350
Your voice is echoing all over the place.

2299
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:54,770
Wow! You look so happy!

2300
02:04:57,910 --> 02:04:58,910
Wow!

2301
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:05,850
It's gone!

2302
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:07,630
It's gone!

2303
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:15,270
It's gone!

2304
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:27,150
It's coming out more and more.

2305
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,870
What a life!

2306
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:30,690
It's all gone,
isn't it? It's gone.

2307
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:35,930


2308
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:38,970
It was the best!

2309
02:05:39,650 --> 02:05:40,010
It was the best!

2310
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:42,150
It was terrible!

2311
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:43,910
Really?

2312
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:46,170
You were so excited!

2313
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:48,430
I was so excited!

2314
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:50,550
Ah!

2315
02:05:51,550 --> 02:05:53,310
You are still standing!

2316
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:55,050
You are still standing!

2317
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:57,290
Ah!

2318
02:05:58,170 --> 02:05:58,850
Ah!

2319
02:05:58,851 --> 02:05:59,150
Ah!

2320
02:05:59,151 --> 02:06:00,151
Ah!

2321
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:27,220
Are you sad?

2322
02:06:27,221 --> 02:06:28,221
What's wrong?

2323
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:32,000
I left the door unlocked.

2324
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:37,780
As a boss, you have to take
care of your subordinates.

2325
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:45,260
Didn't you like it?

2326
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:48,410
What do you mean?

2327
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:50,910
What do you mean? Like this.

2328
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,050


2329
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:56,830
What are you imagining?

2330
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:02,530
Do you want to do it again?

2331
02:07:03,850 --> 02:07:04,931
Do you want to do it again?

2332
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:08,480
I want to do it again.

2333
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:16,340
I'm fine.

2334
02:07:18,925 --> 02:07:20,780
You were a little too excited just now.

2335
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,480
You can do it again.

2336
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:25,120
Yes.

2337
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:33,940
Give me a kiss.

2338
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:43,550
Kiss!

2339
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:52,290
Oh, it's melting.

2340
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:59,410
Oh, it's hard for everyone here.

2341
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:20,690
It feels good just to kiss you.

2342
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:52,610
Chikkun, do you want me to rub your back?

2343
02:08:57,850 --> 02:08:59,730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2344
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:04,290
You're moving your hips
because you're so happy.

2345
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:53,140
Do you like it? I like it, too.

2346
02:09:55,095 --> 02:09:57,041
Do you like it, too?

2347
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:03,760
It's cool, isn't it?

2348
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:22,120
Oh, it's coming out.

2349
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:23,620
I'm sorry.

2350
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:27,060
You are so big.

2351
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:30,900
You are amazing.

2352
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:43,690
Do you want me to touch you?

2353
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:47,910
I want you to touch me.

2354
02:11:13,625 --> 02:11:23,600
What do you think of me?

2355
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:24,650
What do you think of me?

2356
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:27,960
What do you think of me?

2357
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:29,420
Just a boss?

2358
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:38,630
We're a good match, aren't we?

2359
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,041
We're the best, aren't we?

2360
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:43,410
Yes.

2361
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,120
I'm so nervous.

2362
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:21,420
You told me that you like me the most.

2363
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:27,760
I'd like you to be in
charge of this project.

2364
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:31,960
Really?

2365
02:12:34,170 --> 02:12:36,140
I'll leave it to you.

2366
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,040
I love you.

2367
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:38,090
It's hot.

2368
02:13:38,650 --> 02:13:39,650
It's hot.

2369
02:13:39,730 --> 02:13:41,410
You like it, don't
you? It's hot.

2370
02:13:55,140 --> 02:14:10,980
It's delicious.

2371
02:14:10,981 --> 02:14:11,981


2372
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:23,370
You were about to eat it.

2373
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:26,450
You have to eat it.

2374
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:34,641
Why do you open your mouth?

2375
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:37,050
I'm a little embarrassed.

2376
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:41,010
I wanted you to do this.

2377
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:42,530
Eat it.

2378
02:14:42,531 --> 02:14:43,470
Oh, there you are.

2379
02:14:43,471 --> 02:14:45,110
Oh, there you are.

2380
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:47,910
It's OK, Hayashi-chan.

2381
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:58,240
Does it feel good?

2382
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,220
Your butthole is twitching.

2383
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,220
Oh, great.

2384
02:15:09,330 --> 02:15:10,780
Oh, it feels good.

2385
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:11,880
I'm sorry.

2386
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:13,960
I'm sorry.

2387
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:22,440
I feel sick.

2388
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:27,100
You look like a pervert.

2389
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:28,960
You look like a pervert.

2390
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:36,000
I can't do it.

2391
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:42,940
It was hot, wasn't
it? Yes, it was.

This is the first time
I've ever seen a baby cry.

2415
02:18:30,890 --> 02:18:31,890
Hello everyone!

2416
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:49,650
This is my first time
going live on YouTube.

2417
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:13,710
I'm so tired.

2418
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:30,360
I'm so tired.

2419
02:19:32,450 --> 02:19:56,230
I'm so tired.

2420
02:19:56,231 --> 02:20:00,310
Wow, it's amazing.

2421
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:05,610
I'm going to sleep.

2422
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:07,010
I'm going to sleep.

2423

Good night.

2425
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:17,190
Good night.

2426
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:56,600
I want to sleep more.

2427
02:21:41,970 --> 02:21:42,970
I feel so good.

I feel so good.

2429
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:49,460
I don't want to wake you up.

2430

I feel so good.

2431
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:58,140
I'm so relieved.

2432
02:22:58,141 --> 02:22:59,141
I'm sorry.

2433
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,340
I'm sorry.

2434
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:02,560
You're hungry, aren't
you? I'm hungry.

2435

It feels good.

You've been scared all the
time, haven't you? Yes, I have.

2441
02:23:40,341 --> 02:23:41,341
Oh, dear.

2442
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:44,740
Oh, no.

2443
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:52,240
Don't laugh.

2444
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:53,900
Oh, no.

2445
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:56,300


2446
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:58,860
Shall I put it in your
mouth? It's all right.

2447
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:02,680


2448
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,760
You wanted to put it in
your mouth, didn't you?

2449
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:07,300
Yes.

2450
02:24:07,301 --> 02:24:09,440
Oh, it's coming out.

2451
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:12,300
Oh, it feels good.

Oh, it feels good.

2454
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:42,500
Oh, it feels good even if I do it slowly.

2455
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:51,040
Oh, my god!

2456
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:54,470
Oh, no!

2457
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:55,270
Oh, no! Don't hurry up.

2458
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:57,470
Oh, no.

2459
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:58,690
Easy.

2460
02:24:59,510 --> 02:25:00,530


2461
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,030
Oh, no!

2462
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:09,310
I feel very uncomfortable
even though I just touched you.

2463
02:25:09,735 --> 02:25:11,815
I feel uncomfortable even
though I just touched you.

2464
02:25:13,755 --> 02:25:18,370
Oh, my god!

2465
02:25:18,371 --> 02:25:19,371
Oh, my god!

2466
02:25:20,570 --> 02:25:22,470
It feels so good.

2467
02:25:29,610 --> 02:25:30,610
It feels so good.

2468
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:37,730
But I'm going to leave soon.

2469
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:49,270
It feels so good.

2470
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:51,850
I'm tired.

2471
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:56,510
Let's get married.

2472
02:25:57,450 --> 02:25:59,350
I think it's a good idea.

2473
02:25:59,550 --> 02:26:01,190
Let's get married.

2474
02:26:01,191 --> 02:26:06,310
You are too close to me.

2475
02:26:08,365 --> 02:26:29,580
No, you can't do that.

2476
02:26:29,581 --> 02:26:31,200
Oh, You must be tired, dear.

2477
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:42,540
Oh, that's it, hang in there, dear.

2478
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,560
Oh, I love it! Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2479
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:48,500


2480
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:49,880
I love it! Oh, nice.

2481
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:54,330


2482
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:39,340
え、すごい。

2483
02:27:42,190 --> 02:28:01,570
あ、気持ちいい。

2484
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:24,870
あ、すごい。

2485
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:35,650
すごい。

2486
02:28:45,980 --> 02:28:47,240
気持ちいい。

2487
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:59,590
あ、やばい。 You are going to puke.

2488
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:01,550
I'm going to puke.

2489
02:29:02,330 --> 02:29:02,510
Let me out of the baby's belly.

2490
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:04,430
Let me out of the baby's belly.

2491
02:29:04,890 --> 02:29:06,910
I'm so worried.

2492
02:29:07,470 --> 02:29:09,890
Let me out of the baby's belly.

2493
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:16,650
Let me out of the baby's belly.

2494
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:42,700
You are out of the baby's belly.

2495
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:46,520
What if the baby comes to me?

2496
02:29:49,010 --> 02:29:50,010
What should I
do? I'll marry you.

2497
02:29:50,770 --> 02:29:52,160


2498
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:55,940
Let's get married.

2499
02:29:58,730 --> 02:30:00,260
Even if I can't have a baby.

2500
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:14,200
Can you do it? I can do it.

2501
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:16,320
I can do it.

2502
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,740
Please hold me.

2503
02:30:19,741 --> 02:30:20,920


2504
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:22,540
I'm holding you.

2505
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:23,440
It's open.

2506
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:24,660
Please.

2507
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,020
Is the door open?

2508
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:31,280
Hayashi?

2509
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Yes.

2510
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:36,520
What?

2511
02:30:36,521 --> 02:30:37,521
Hayashi?

2512
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:39,320
What are you doing?

2513
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:39,740
What's wrong? Nothing.

2514
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:41,620


2515
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:45,380
I was about to sleep.

2516
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:46,980
Were you?

2517
02:30:46,981 --> 02:30:47,981
Yes.

2518
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:51,880
I couldn't sleep either.

2519
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:53,680
Oh, is that so? You're awake.

2520
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,240


2521
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:55,940
What?

2522
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:57,340
Is it bad?

2523
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:58,840
Oh, no, it's totally fine.

2524
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:03,280
Oh, you're awake.

2525
02:31:04,390 --> 02:31:05,800
You couldn't sleep at all today.

2526
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:07,050
Oh, that's right.

2527
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:10,500
Oh, yes, that's true.

2528
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:12,380
What did you do in the morning?

2529
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:15,500
Well, I just took a walk.

2530
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:17,480
Where did you go? So? Oh, no.

2531
02:31:17,481 --> 02:31:17,600


2532
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,080


2533
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:21,160
I just got a cold.

2534
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:22,500
Oh, you got a cold.

2535
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,180
Yeah, I thought it was a little hot.

2536
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:25,540
Oh, I see.

2537
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:26,600
Yeah.

2538
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:27,700
I see.

2539
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:29,960
I was just thinking about Hayashi.

2540
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:33,090
Oh, really? Yeah.

2541
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:34,580


2542
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:36,400
Aren't you going to do it?

2543
02:31:37,090 --> 02:31:37,500
What? You're strong.

2544
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:39,260
What? With me.

2545
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:40,080


2546
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:41,420


2547
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:42,940
What?

2548
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,000
What?

2549
02:31:50,265 --> 02:31:52,960
We are getting old,
aren't we? Yes, we are.

2550
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:54,440


2551
02:31:54,850 --> 02:32:00,040
That's why it's good to do
something like this once in a while.

2552
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:01,700
That's true.

2553
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,820
Hayashi's kiss is soft.

2554
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:13,640
Really?

2555
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:13,980
Really?

2556
02:32:13,981 --> 02:32:14,981
Yes.

2557
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:17,220
Really?

2558
02:32:17,380 --> 02:32:18,380
Yes.

2559
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:34,080
Your kiss is amazing.

2560
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:35,520
Really?

2561
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:35,680
Yes.

2562
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I'm happy.

2563
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:40,860
You can feel my nipples.

2564
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:43,520
Well, yes.

2565
02:32:43,521 --> 02:32:44,521
I see.

2566
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:44,860
Yes.

2567
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:46,840
Don't you think you're a bit chubby?

2568
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:49,360
Oh, really?

2569
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:50,960
Yes.

2570
02:32:57,570 --> 02:32:59,200
How is it? Do you feel your nipples?

2571
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,220
I like to be licked.

2572
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:04,320
Oh, really?

2573
02:33:04,420 --> 02:33:04,720
Yes.

2574
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:09,300
I don't think you look like that, but
when I look at your nipples, I can tell.

2575
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:14,740
Do you like to sleep?

2576
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:17,380
I like that, too.

2577
02:33:17,630 --> 02:33:19,900
What? You like it? You're a do-it-all.

2578
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:21,600
No, I'm not.

2579
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:23,380
You're a do-it-all.

2580
02:33:23,770 --> 02:33:24,770
No, I'm not.

2581
02:34:01,810 --> 02:34:02,810
Oh, no.

2582
02:34:04,835 --> 02:34:07,710
What? You're already standing up.

2583
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:10,750
Well, I'm going to stand up.

2584
02:34:11,650 --> 02:34:12,650
You have to sink down.

2585
02:34:15,790 --> 02:34:16,790
I have to sink down?

2586
02:34:28,390 --> 02:34:30,390
It's hard, isn't it? Well, yes.

2587
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:34,230


2588
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:36,530
My nipples are a little weak.

2589
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:36,950
Your nipples?

2590
02:34:37,550 --> 02:34:40,990
You're a pervert.

2591
02:34:40,991 --> 02:34:43,150
Wow, it's so nice here.

2592
02:34:43,310 --> 02:34:45,850
Wow, it's amazing.

2593
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:49,160
It's so big.

2594
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:04,660
Since we're already doing this,

2595
02:35:05,405 --> 02:35:06,800
do you want to go out with me?

2596
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:10,180
Go out with you?

2597
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:13,160
Can I? Yes, you can.

2598
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:15,500


2599
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:20,040
Are you okay with me?

2600
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,400
Yes.

2601
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:24,720
How do you feel? I feel great.

2602
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:27,340


2603
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:28,920
How do you feel? I feel great.

2604
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:33,800


2605
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:35,100
Really?

2606
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:36,220
Yes.

2607
02:35:36,660 --> 02:35:37,660
I'm glad.

2608
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:46,730
It's so big.

2609
02:35:47,130 --> 02:35:48,570
I don't know where to start licking.

2610
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:14,300
It's so good.

2611
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,520
Does it feel good?

2612
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:19,720
It feels so good.

2613
02:36:19,721 --> 02:36:20,721
I can feel it.

2614
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:22,170
I can feel it a lot.

2615
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:33,780
I can feel it a lot.

2616
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:42,300
That's bad.

2617
02:36:42,380 --> 02:36:43,380
That's bad?

2618
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:05,860
It feels so good.

2619
02:37:09,785 --> 02:37:12,340
You look like you feel it a lot.

2620
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:14,340
Yes.

2621
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:18,240
I've never seen your face like that.

2622
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,160
Touch my boobs.

2623
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,260
Can I?

2624
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:29,560
Yes.

2625
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:38,740
How is it? It's good.

2626
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:42,520
It's erotic.

2627
02:37:47,410 --> 02:37:53,990


2628
02:37:54,470 --> 02:37:55,470
Is it erotic?

2629
02:37:59,970 --> 02:38:02,810
I'm a little nervous because
it's just the two of us.

2630
02:38:04,210 --> 02:38:06,470
Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing.

2631
02:38:07,050 --> 02:38:08,930
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

2632
02:38:16,090 --> 02:38:30,780
Do you have something in your hand?

2633
02:38:32,025 --> 02:38:33,120
No, it's nothing.

2634
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:33,940
Nothing? Nothing.

2635
02:38:34,300 --> 02:38:35,300


2636
02:38:35,420 --> 02:38:36,660
I just want to kiss you.

2637
02:38:46,170 --> 02:38:47,690
Can I touch you?

2638
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:49,550
Yes.

2639
02:38:57,450 --> 02:38:58,450
Really?

2640
02:38:58,770 --> 02:38:59,770
Really?

2641
02:39:01,870 --> 02:39:15,870
Are you happy?

2642
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:23,350
Are you happy? I love you.

2643
02:39:26,650 --> 02:39:27,650


2644
02:39:39,610 --> 02:39:42,550
You are small and cute.

2645
02:39:42,551 --> 02:39:44,550
You are so small.

2646
02:39:45,310 --> 02:39:46,310
Am I small?

2647
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:23,600
What's wrong with your butt?

2648
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:26,750
My butt is itchy.

2649
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:30,800
You are erotic.

2650
02:40:31,060 --> 02:40:32,060
You are very erotic.

2651
02:40:32,925 --> 02:40:34,640
Do you like your
butt? Yes, I do.

2652
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:37,060


2653
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:37,860
Really? I love my butt.

2654
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:39,400


2655
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,320
Really?

2656
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:42,380
Yes.

2657
02:40:42,550 --> 02:40:43,760
Can I look at your butt more?

2658
02:40:43,761 --> 02:40:44,761
What?

2659
02:40:54,060 --> 02:40:55,540
Wow, it's amazing.

2660
02:40:58,870 --> 02:41:00,570
This guy is really erotic.

2661
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:01,370
Is he?

2662
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:02,090
Yes.

2663
02:41:02,350 --> 02:41:02,670
Really?

2664
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:03,990
Yes.

2665
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:07,750
Can I?

2666
02:41:08,290 --> 02:41:09,290
Yes.

2667
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:17,590
How is it?

2668
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:20,760
He's really erotic.

2669
02:41:21,070 --> 02:41:21,170
Is he?

2670
02:41:21,171 --> 02:41:21,410
Is it erotic?

2671
02:41:22,090 --> 02:41:23,090
Yes.

2672
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:25,560
Really? That's great.

2673
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:28,820


2674
02:41:55,180 --> 02:41:57,160
Where did you learn to lick like that?

2675
02:41:57,960 --> 02:41:58,960
How is it?

2676
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:00,900
It feels so good.

2677
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:02,320
How is it?

2678
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:42,270
Wow.

2679
02:42:44,660 --> 02:42:45,660
Your butt is so soft.

2680
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:47,900
Really?

2681
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:50,540
Can I touch it?

2682
02:43:46,540 --> 02:44:00,600
I want to put it in, but is it okay?

2683
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:04,520
Because we are dating.

2684
02:44:06,020 --> 02:44:07,640
Oh, I see.

2685
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:08,300
Yes.

2686
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:09,120
Oh.

2687
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:09,500
No problem.

2688
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,120
Really?

2689
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:12,160
Yes.

2690
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:15,550
I'm happy to hear that from Hayashi.

2691
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:27,230
Well, but... Will you
ride on my back?

2692
02:44:28,050 --> 02:44:29,050
Yes.

2693
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:37,140
Oh, great.

2694
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:38,460
I'm going in.

2695
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:40,020
Oh.

2696
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:41,340
Oh.

2697
02:44:42,610 --> 02:44:49,460
Oh, it feels so good!

2698
02:45:15,270 --> 02:45:17,900
Hey, where are you looking at?

2699
02:45:18,330 --> 02:45:21,540
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

2700
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:23,240
You're staring at me.

2701
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:24,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

2702
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:25,600
Just look at me.

2703
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:27,260
Oh, okay.

2704
02:45:31,850 --> 02:45:33,340
It feels good.

2705
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:34,200
Does it? It feels good.

2706
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:34,920
Me too.

2707
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:36,020


2708
02:45:46,350 --> 02:46:03,300
Oh, my God!

2709
02:46:05,460 --> 02:46:14,980
Oh, my God!

2710
02:46:14,981 --> 02:46:15,981
Oh, no!

2711
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:17,740
I'm going to puke!

2712
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:18,960
I'm going to puke!

2713
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,340
Wait, wait!

2714
02:46:21,090 --> 02:46:23,220
But, which one?

2715
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:25,200
Will I be able to puke?

2716
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:26,120
What?

2717
02:46:26,121 --> 02:46:26,360
What?

2718
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:26,940
Say it out loud!

2719
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:28,040
What?

2720
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:29,580
Wait, wait!

2721
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:31,060
What should I do?

2722
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:33,040
Oh, I'm going to puke!

2723
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:35,120
Puke!

2724
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:36,060
Puke!

2725
02:46:36,061 --> 02:46:36,340
Puke!

2726
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:37,200
Oh, I'm sorry!

2727
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:38,420
I'm going to puke!

2728
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:39,140
Oh!

2729
02:46:39,580 --> 02:46:40,580
Oh!

2730
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:42,040
Oh!

2731
02:46:42,620 --> 02:46:43,120
Oh!

2732
02:46:43,380 --> 02:46:43,660
Oh!

2733
02:46:43,661 --> 02:46:47,761
Ah… Ah… Ah…

2734
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:54,820
Oh my god!

2735
02:46:55,420 --> 02:46:56,920
You've got something white.

2736
02:46:58,820 --> 02:47:00,260
Ah, it comes out.

2737
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:02,440
Oh, this deep?

2738
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:05,100
Hey, Hayashi!

2739
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:06,380
What are you doing?

2740
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:08,280
I'm your friend.

2741
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:10,020
Tachibana?

2742
02:47:10,021 --> 02:47:13,660
Hey, you said you were
going to marry me, didn't you?

2743
02:47:13,661 --> 02:47:16,100
Um... Hey, Hayashi,
I didn't hear that.

2744
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:19,180
Um... You said it.

2745
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:21,560
You said you were going
to marry me, didn't you?

2746
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:22,980
What?

2747
02:47:23,190 --> 02:47:25,200
You made a baby, didn't you?

2748
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:26,540
It might be born.

2749
02:47:27,640 --> 02:47:30,760
Um... I don't know what to do.

2750
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:33,960
Hey, you can't do that.

2751
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:36,220
You can't do that at all.

2752
02:47:36,221 --> 02:47:37,221
You can't do that.

2753
02:47:38,960 --> 02:47:41,240
You're the worst.

2754
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:53,180
Let me do it.

2755
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:54,920
Hey!

2756
02:47:55,800 --> 02:47:56,800
What are you doing?

2757
02:47:57,140 --> 02:47:58,720
You just licked me, didn't you?

2758
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:14,740
I'm going to do it, too.

2759
02:48:15,900 --> 02:48:22,020
I'm going to do it, too.

2760
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:31,740
Touch me.

2761
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:33,440
What? Touch me.

2762
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:35,000


2763
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:37,380
Which one do you like
better? I don't know.

2764
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:40,920


2765
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:42,960
Which one do you like better?

2766
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:44,100
Which one?

2767
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:21,720
Oh, it feels good.

2768
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:24,060
It doesn't feel good.

2769
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:34,340
I'm going to put it in.

2770
02:49:35,180 --> 02:49:36,240
I'm going to overwrite it.

2771
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:39,520
I'm going to overwrite it because
I put it in Mizuki-san's room.

2772
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,500
It feels good.

2773
02:49:51,340 --> 02:49:55,800
It feels good, doesn't
it? It feels good.

2774
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:58,140


2775
02:49:58,340 --> 02:49:59,540
It feels good, doesn't it?

2776
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:01,920
Say you love me the most.

2777
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,120
Say it quickly.

2778
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:05,920
I love you.

2779
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:07,320
Say it.

2780
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:14,560
I love you.

2781
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:15,380
Say it.

2782
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:15,780
Say you feel good.

2783
02:50:16,340 --> 02:50:17,340
I feel good.

2784
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:18,800
Say you feel good.

2785
02:50:20,020 --> 02:50:22,480
I feel good.

2786
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:23,420
You are the best.

2787
02:50:23,421 --> 02:50:24,661
I'm going to take off my shoes.

2788
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:31,260
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2789
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:37,360
I'm sorry.

2790
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:39,960
It's okay.

2791
02:50:39,961 --> 02:50:40,961
It's okay.

2792
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:43,680
It's okay.

2793
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:46,020
It's okay.

2794
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:49,640
It's okay.

2795
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:58,140
I felt like I had a hard time.

2796
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:05,650
I've been through a lot.

2797
02:51:06,670 --> 02:51:07,670
It's hard.

2798
02:51:09,770 --> 02:51:10,770
It's hard.

2799
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:19,780
It feels good.

2800
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:22,160
It's hard.

2801
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:23,640
It feels good.

2802
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:27,380
It's hard.

2803
02:51:30,460 --> 02:51:32,020
I'm going to die.

2804
02:51:32,120 --> 02:51:33,120
I'm going to die.

2805
02:51:40,820 --> 02:51:42,240
I'm going to die.

2806
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:43,980
You have a lot of space.

2807
02:51:48,580 --> 02:51:50,180
I'm tired.

2808
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:52,480
I'm tired.

2809
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,120
I'm tired.

2810
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,600
My ankles are shaking.

2811
02:51:57,060 --> 02:51:58,140
My ankles are shaking.

2812
02:51:58,580 --> 02:51:59,580
Yes, yes.

2813
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:02,940
You look so comfortable.

2814
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:06,980
Stick to the bottom.

2815
02:52:07,660 --> 02:52:08,700
Stick to the bottom.

2816
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:10,940
Oh, it feels good.

2817
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:16,980
There, there.

2818
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:17,560
Stick to the bottom.

2819
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:19,440
No, no.

2820
02:52:29,195 --> 02:52:30,560
Stick more.

2821
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:35,220
Can you show me your face?

2822
02:52:43,530 --> 02:52:44,670
You look so happy.

2823
02:52:49,370 --> 02:52:53,730
How do you feel?

2824
02:52:59,730 --> 02:53:03,450
Do you feel good? My baby.

2825
02:53:04,250 --> 02:53:05,550
..

2826
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:08,130
My baby feels better, doesn't it?

2827
02:53:08,590 --> 02:53:09,590
Tell me I'm the best.

2828
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:11,310
Tell me my baby is the best.

2829
02:53:12,110 --> 02:53:14,930
My baby is the best, isn't it, Hayashi?

2830
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:17,750
My baby feels better, doesn't it?

2831
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:20,330
My baby feels better, doesn't it, Hayashi?

2832
02:53:20,830 --> 02:53:22,110
My baby feels great,
doesn't it? I love my baby.

2833
02:53:24,230 --> 02:53:25,710


2834
02:53:27,150 --> 02:53:28,150
My baby is sleeping.

2835
02:53:28,230 --> 02:53:29,170
I love my baby.

2836
02:53:29,171 --> 02:53:30,850
Give me the baby.

2837
02:53:30,851 --> 02:53:32,510
It feels good.

2838
02:53:34,470 --> 02:53:35,510
It feels good, doesn't it?

2839
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:40,770
Are you going to give birth again?

2840
02:53:41,810 --> 02:53:43,630
Give me the baby.

2841
02:53:45,810 --> 02:53:49,090
Give me the baby.

2842
02:53:49,091 --> 02:53:49,790
What are you doing?

2843
02:53:49,950 --> 02:53:55,520
What are you doing?

2844
02:54:09,470 --> 02:54:11,830
You made me cry again.

2845
02:54:14,490 --> 02:54:15,590
I hope you can have a baby.

2846
02:54:16,770 --> 02:54:18,630
I want to have a baby again.

2847
02:54:19,370 --> 02:54:20,650
I want you to make me cry a lot.

2848
02:54:21,610 --> 02:54:24,550
You'll go out with me, won't
you, Hayashi? It's delicious.

2849
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:27,950
It's delicious.

2850
02:54:28,670 --> 02:54:30,010


2851
02:54:37,250 --> 02:54:37,950
I have two of them.

2852
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:39,490
I'm going to eat them all.

2853
02:54:42,290 --> 02:54:48,430
I'm going to eat two.

2854
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:56,990
I'm going to eat two.

2855
02:54:57,015 --> 02:55:05,270
I'm going to eat two.

2856
02:55:06,790 --> 02:55:08,310
Are you awake,
Hayashi? Yes, I'm awake.

2857
02:55:08,730 --> 02:55:09,730


2858
02:55:10,590 --> 02:55:12,670
Did you decide which
one Mizuki and I should do?

2859
02:55:13,490 --> 02:55:13,890
What?

2860
02:55:14,190 --> 02:55:15,310
Did you decide?

2861
02:55:15,790 --> 02:55:17,910
No, I can't decide.

2862
02:55:18,410 --> 02:55:19,410
Come on, decide.

2863
02:55:22,050 --> 02:55:23,090
Which one was better?

2864
02:55:23,610 --> 02:55:26,530
Come on, decide.

2865
02:55:27,130 --> 02:55:28,230
Which one do you like?

2866
02:55:28,231 --> 02:55:29,231
Do you feel good? It's me.

2867
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:33,730


2868
02:55:34,330 --> 02:55:36,110
It's me, isn't it? It's suspicious.

2869
02:55:42,430 --> 02:55:43,790
Which one do you want to eat?

2870
02:55:44,490 --> 02:55:45,650
Which one do you want to eat?

2871
02:55:50,350 --> 02:55:55,370
Which one do you
want to eat? OK, I got it.

2872
02:55:58,370 --> 02:55:59,970


2873
02:56:00,470 --> 02:56:02,190
Mizuki-san and I will put them alternately.

2874
02:56:02,570 --> 02:56:03,890
Let's decide which one is better.

2875
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:06,310
OK, let's do it.

2876
02:56:08,030 --> 02:56:09,150
You have to decide properly.

2877
02:56:11,130 --> 02:56:12,130
Which one is better?

2878
02:56:12,350 --> 02:56:13,350
It's definitely me.

2879
02:56:14,250 --> 02:56:15,610
It's definitely me.

2880
02:56:17,250 --> 02:56:18,470
Which one is better? I'm ready.

2881
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:20,110
Let's decide.

2882
02:56:21,110 --> 02:56:22,110


2883
02:56:22,550 --> 02:56:24,330
Which one do you want to start with?

2884
02:56:24,550 --> 02:56:24,950
Which one do you want to start with?

2885
02:56:25,290 --> 02:56:26,290
Hurry up and decide.

2886
02:56:27,670 --> 02:56:29,430
I'll start with Mizuki.

2887
02:56:30,430 --> 02:56:31,430
I'll start with Mizuki.

2888
02:56:32,150 --> 02:56:33,410
Okay, hurry up.

2889
02:56:33,910 --> 02:56:34,910
I'll start.

2890
02:56:35,330 --> 02:56:35,490
I'll start.

2891
02:56:35,491 --> 02:56:36,491
It's my turn next.

2892
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:43,490
I'll look at you carefully.

2893
02:56:44,350 --> 02:56:45,350
Okay.

2894
02:56:53,870 --> 02:56:54,910
I'm sorry.

2895
02:56:55,830 --> 02:56:56,830
I'm so sorry.

2896
02:56:57,610 --> 02:56:58,890
Are you okay? It feels good.

2897
02:56:59,630 --> 02:57:01,190


2898
02:57:01,470 --> 02:57:02,470
What does it feel
like? It's good.

2899
02:57:03,140 --> 02:57:04,770


2900
02:57:05,250 --> 02:57:07,230
I can't touch you.

2901
02:57:07,890 --> 02:57:09,410
I'm sorry.

2902
02:57:09,650 --> 02:57:10,650
It's okay.

2903
02:57:10,790 --> 02:57:12,650
I'm sorry.

2904
02:57:15,470 --> 02:57:16,930
It's good.

2905
02:57:16,931 --> 02:57:20,610
It's so hot.

2906
02:57:21,610 --> 02:57:22,610
It's so hot.

2907
02:57:24,830 --> 02:57:26,390
It's so hot.

2908
02:57:29,230 --> 02:57:30,230
It's so hot.

2909
02:57:34,490 --> 02:57:39,970
It's so hot.

2910
02:57:40,590 --> 02:57:46,810
It's so hot.

2911
02:57:46,811 --> 02:57:47,811
Ouch!

2912
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:01,120
Did you go to the
doctor? No, I didn't.

2913
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:02,700


2914
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:04,220
I have to do it at the office.

2915
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:05,880
What?

2916
02:58:08,110 --> 02:58:09,110
Can I try from the back?

2917
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:11,380
I can't help it.

2918
02:58:14,630 --> 02:58:15,880
Hurry up.

2919
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:18,520
My butt.

2920
02:58:39,580 --> 02:58:42,680
Oh my god!

2921
02:58:43,020 --> 02:58:46,300
Oh my god!

2922
02:58:47,620 --> 02:58:49,200
Oh my god! I can't do it.

2923
02:58:49,201 --> 02:58:51,600
I can't do it.

2924
02:58:55,780 --> 02:59:08,600


2925
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:35,960
I'm going to sleep in this bag.

2926
02:59:38,065 --> 02:59:49,400
I'm going to sleep in your back.

2927
02:59:49,550 --> 02:59:51,820
Ahh, it's so good.

2928
02:59:52,660 --> 02:59:54,980
This is so good.

2929
02:59:55,140 --> 02:59:55,800
This is the best.

2930
02:59:55,801 --> 02:59:58,420
I'll give you a hand.

2931
03:00:00,440 --> 03:00:02,640
Don't forget to wash your face.

2932
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:04,300
Oh, it feels good.

2933
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:09,640
Oh, it feels good.

2934
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:16,000
It feels good.

2935
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:20,900
Give me your face.

2936
03:00:20,901 --> 03:00:21,901
Give me your hand.

2937
03:00:24,580 --> 03:00:26,700
Oh, it's going away.

2938
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:37,460
It feels good.

2939
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:40,380
It feels good, doesn't
it? It feels good.

2940
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:41,400


2941
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:43,640
How do you feel, Tachibana?

2942
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,540
Which one do you feel good?

2943
03:00:47,541 --> 03:00:48,701
Which one do you feel better?

2944
03:00:49,100 --> 03:00:50,216
Which one do you feel better?

2945
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:51,360
Have you decided? Put this in.

2946
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:55,100


2947
03:00:57,220 --> 03:00:58,220
This one? Let's compare.

2948
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:00,240
Let's compare.

2949
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:01,940
I feel better.

2950
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:07,100


2951
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:07,840
Do you feel
better? I feel better.

2952
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:10,260


2953
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:11,600
How is your neck? I feel better.

2954
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:13,320
I'm sorry.

2955
03:01:13,321 --> 03:01:14,520
I feel so good.

2956
03:01:15,900 --> 03:01:17,460
I'm so sorry.

2957
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:23,540


2958
03:01:28,460 --> 03:01:34,240
I'm so glad to hear it.

2959
03:01:35,720 --> 03:01:36,960
I feel so good.

2960
03:01:36,961 --> 03:01:37,980
I feel so good.

2961
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:42,780
I feel so good.

2962
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:45,440
I feel so good.

2963
03:01:52,120 --> 03:02:00,180
Don't cry. I feel so good.

2964
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:02,980
How do you feel, Hayashi?

2965
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:04,740
Which one do you feel good?

2966
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:10,480
How is it? Which one do
you like? OK, next is me.

2967
03:02:11,570 --> 03:02:13,340


2968
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:15,880
I can't decide at all.

2969
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:37,960
How do you feel?

2970
03:02:38,750 --> 03:02:41,340
I'm often told that I close my eyes.

2971
03:02:41,341 --> 03:02:43,020
I close my eyes, too.

2972
03:02:44,720 --> 03:02:45,720
Hurry up!

2973
03:02:47,650 --> 03:02:49,560
How do you feel?

2974
03:02:50,210 --> 03:02:51,210
Hurry up! It feels good.

2975
03:02:57,240 --> 03:03:00,560


2976
03:03:02,650 --> 03:03:03,600
How do you feel?

2977
03:03:03,601 --> 03:03:04,601
It's good, isn't it?

2978
03:03:05,140 --> 03:03:05,560
Yeah, it's good.

2979
03:03:05,660 --> 03:03:06,660
Do you like it?

2980
03:03:08,380 --> 03:03:09,380
Is it good?

2981
03:03:15,060 --> 03:03:17,020
It's good, isn't
it? It's so good.

2982
03:03:18,600 --> 03:03:18,780
It's so good.

2983
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:23,720
It's so good.

2984
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:25,580
It's so good.

2985
03:03:25,581 --> 03:03:26,581


2986
03:03:39,200 --> 03:03:41,480
feel good how do you feel?

2987
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:42,500
hmm, feel good

2988
03:03:44,800 --> 03:03:48,200
how do you feel? well.

2989
03:03:49,280 --> 03:04:01,120
.

2990
03:04:01,780 --> 03:04:03,460
It feels so good!

2991
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:07,860
It feels so good!

2992
03:04:09,940 --> 03:04:11,100
Oh, no!

2993
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:12,520
What?

2994
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:13,800
Oh, no!

2995
03:04:14,020 --> 03:04:15,020
I'm going!

2996
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:15,900
You're going?

2997
03:04:16,060 --> 03:04:17,060
You're going?

2998
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:18,200
No!

2999
03:04:18,660 --> 03:04:19,040
No!

3000
03:04:19,041 --> 03:04:20,880
Don't go!

3001
03:04:21,460 --> 03:04:22,700
I'm going!

3002
03:04:23,320 --> 03:04:24,320
No!

3003
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:25,640
I'm going!

3004
03:04:25,740 --> 03:04:26,740
I'm going!

3005
03:04:41,820 --> 03:04:43,840
I'm so glad to hear that.

3006
03:04:43,900 --> 03:04:44,960
You're crying a lot.

3007
03:04:46,220 --> 03:04:47,960
I'm so glad to hear that.

3008
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:50,820
I'm not ready yet.

3009
03:04:53,820 --> 03:04:55,660
I'm so glad to hear that.

3010
03:04:56,110 --> 03:04:57,320
It's a pain.

3011
03:04:58,630 --> 03:05:00,160
You can still do it, can't you?

3012
03:05:00,770 --> 03:05:03,640
You can still do it, can't you?

3013
03:05:06,550 --> 03:05:07,550
You're doing great.

3014
03:05:08,040 --> 03:05:09,040
You're doing great.

3015
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:12,400
You're doing great.

3016
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:20,940
Let me hold you.

3017
03:05:22,660 --> 03:05:23,880
I'm worried.

3018
03:05:26,220 --> 03:05:28,620
Ah, it feels good.

3019
03:05:28,900 --> 03:05:31,880
It feels good, doesn't it, Akari?

3020
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:35,800
My baby feels good,
doesn't it? Oh, no.

3021
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:39,560


3022
03:05:40,020 --> 03:05:44,920
Ah, I feel good, too.

3023
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:52,500
Choco, let's go.

3024
03:06:01,960 --> 03:06:04,060
Which one do you feel better?

3025
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:05,200
I want you to pet me more.

3026
03:06:09,790 --> 03:06:10,790
I see.

3027
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:25,500
I feel good.

3028
03:06:25,501 --> 03:06:28,620
It feels good, doesn't it?

3029
03:06:28,621 --> 03:06:31,000
You're standing up well.

3030
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:38,180
It feels good, doesn't it?

3031
03:06:38,181 --> 03:06:39,181
It's mine, isn't
it? It feels good.

3032
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:45,960


3033
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:49,960
It feels good for me, too.

3034
03:06:52,660 --> 03:06:54,920
It's so hot!

3035
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:56,500
It's so hot!

3036
03:06:57,780 --> 03:06:59,560
I feel sick!

3037
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:06,140
I'm about to die.

3038
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:11,180
I can't do this.

3039
03:07:12,760 --> 03:07:17,560
I'm getting more and more swollen.

3040
03:07:17,561 --> 03:07:18,561
I'm here!

3041
03:07:19,460 --> 03:07:20,460
I'm here!

3042
03:07:21,380 --> 03:07:23,400
Let me out!

3043
03:07:23,880 --> 03:07:25,640
Let me out from the back!

3044
03:07:27,260 --> 03:07:28,400
Let me out from the back!

3045
03:07:28,401 --> 03:07:28,740
Let me out!

3046
03:07:28,741 --> 03:07:29,020
Let me out!

3047
03:07:29,340 --> 03:07:30,680
Let me out!

3048
03:07:50,720 --> 03:07:54,180
You look like you're having a hard time.

3049
03:07:58,260 --> 03:07:59,500
I'm so glad.

3050
03:08:00,480 --> 03:08:02,760
You're crying a lot.

3051
03:08:05,080 --> 03:08:07,820
You're crying a lot today, Hayashi.

3052
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:10,920
You're crying a lot.

3053
03:08:10,921 --> 03:08:11,921
What's wrong?

3054
03:08:15,850 --> 03:08:16,850
Can you still do it?

3055
03:08:17,360 --> 03:08:18,360
Can you?

3056
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:36,440
Have you decided which one is better?

3057
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:38,560
Have you?

3058
03:08:39,650 --> 03:08:40,980
I think they are both the best.

3059
03:08:41,460 --> 03:08:42,460
What is that?

3060
03:08:43,260 --> 03:08:44,260
You can't decide?

3061
03:08:44,860 --> 03:08:45,860
You can't decide? Ok, I got it.

3062
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:48,740


3063
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:50,060
Let's do it on a Sunday.

3064
03:08:50,750 --> 03:08:52,780
I'll be the guest, and you'll be the guest.

3065
03:08:53,440 --> 03:08:55,076
I'll be the guest, and you'll be the guest.

3066
03:08:55,100 --> 03:08:56,100
What about Sunday? Sunday.

3067
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:58,240

It's Monday, so I'll be the guest.

I'm going to do more.

I'm going to do more.

3073
03:09:16,560 --> 03:09:18,860
Today is the first day of the school year.
