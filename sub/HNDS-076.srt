00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,620
I'm Akari Mitani.

3
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,460
What I'm good at is...

4
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,840
...feeling good.

5
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,980
Let me squeeze a lot of your raw
chinpo with these 70,000 pieces.

6
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,110
I'm Mina Kitano.

7
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,270
What I like is...

8
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,790
...the eyes of a whole
body that amateurs can't do.

9
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:09,555
I'm Riho Hashimori, and my
favorite thing is that I continue to

10
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:24,000
be in the top three without
stopping even though I'm told to stop.

11
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,360
I'm not going to stop today.

12
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,330
I'm Ichika Matsumoto.

13
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:43,090
Ichi-chan's favorite body parts
are my back and upper body.

14
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,830
I want to do a lot of upper body.

15
00:04:49,935 --> 00:05:00,170
I'm Arisu Nanase.

16
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,830
Do you like Chikubi and Anna-ryo?

17
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:07,290
Do you like it?

18
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,910
Even if you don't like it,

19
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,190
let me do a lot of mischief.

20
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,500
I'm Misono Maka.

21
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,700
I want you to kiss me all the
way to the back of this manko.

22
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,410
I'm Yayoi Mizuki.

23
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,590
I want to lick you until your
wrinkles become smooth.

24
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,630
Good bye.

25
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:22,950
I'm Rima Kudai.

26
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,850
My favorite play is to get
a lot of kisses and a kiss.

27
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,470
I'll never let go of your kiss mark.

28
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,420
I'm Simire Kuramoto.

29
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:55,740
My specialty is licking your
penis with my messy mouth.

30
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,480
Of course, I will make you
feel good with my messy manko.

31
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:19,590
This is my daily song.

32
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:20,591
Hi, I'm Ayaka.

33
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,050
You know, saliva is a drink.

34
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,670
Let me get drunk with your saliva.

35
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Who is good?

36
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,230
Me?

37
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,350
Me?

38
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:18,038
This time, we are going to show
you the behind-the-scenes video

39
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:40,240
of our new album, which will
be released on the 1st of July.

40
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,320
Please look forward to it!

41
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,150
Hello!

42
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,150
It's been a while! I did it.

43
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
No, you didn't.

44
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860


45
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,020
I want to have a nipple.

46
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,330
Which one do you like?

47
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,170
Of course, Ichiko.

48
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,350
Look at me.

49
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,550
Don't look at my nipple.

50
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,390
It doesn't feel good.

51
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,730
Don't fail.

52
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,870
Show me.

53
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,490
One.

54
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,150
Which one is it? Let me see.

55
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,490


56
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,660
I haven't licked it yet.

57
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,820
I don't think I've licked it yet.

58
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,780
I don't think so.

59
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,640
I don't think I've licked it yet.

60
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,930
It's already crispy.

61
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,480
It's not that it's already crispy.

62
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:14,660
What do you mean?

63
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm sure you got a little drunk.

64
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Wow!

65
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,520
I feel like I'm running out of breath.

66
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,636
You're holding it in.
You're putting on a face.

67
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Cute.

68
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
What are you going to do?

69
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:12,080
I'm going to put it out.

70
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm going to put it out.

71
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm going to put it out.

72
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:13,260
I'm going to put it out.

73
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,460
I'm going to put it out.

74
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,780
It's gone when you ate it.

75
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,850
I love you.

76
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,860
I'm number one.

77
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Wait a minute.

78
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:22,030
You want to put it in a
real manko, don't you?

79
00:18:24,270 --> 00:19:23,070
I promised to put it in a real manko.

80
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,990
You don't do that, do
you? Wait a minute.

81
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,090
I promised.

82
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,100


83
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Please give it to Koha.

84
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,570
I don't do that.

85
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:43,130
I don't do that, either.

86
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,670
Give it to me.

87
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,470
I want to eat it, too.

88
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,590
Wait! When did you
put it in? I'll put it in.

89
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,470


90
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:28,240
Do you want to put it in
this smooth bean paste?

91
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:54,560
It's my bean paste.

92
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,610
It's my bean paste.

93
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,370
Do you remember?

94
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,910
Do you remember everyone's mangos?

95
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,650
This is the 10th person.

96
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,010
That's right.

97
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,930
All of us put mangos in it.

98
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,470
Yarin-chan.

99
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,270
Yarin-chan.

100
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm jealous.

101
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,420
You wanted to eat all of
them, didn't you? That's right.

102
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
I'm jealous.

103
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,160


104
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,800
You are a happy man.

105
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,580
We've warmed up our bodies.

106
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,640
We're all in the same color, right?

107
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,500
Who liked the
doggy? I'll heal you.

108
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,400
You're tired, aren't you?

109
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,200
I want to be healed, too.

110
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,360
It's a great ending.

111
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,580
We're at the limit, aren't we?

112
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,200
We're at the limit.

113
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,201
It's OK.

114
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:10,090
Wow, wow, wow.

115
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,090
Is it coming out? Yes, it is.

116
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,390


117
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:21,390
It's coming out a lot, isn't it?

118
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,930
It's coming out a lot.

119
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,410
I'm so lucky.

120
00:27:35,310 --> 00:28:03,450
I want to take a picture with you.

121
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,090
Who did you like the most?

122
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:31,040
The future was good.

123
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,100
I want to go to the past.

124
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,690
I saw the panties.

125
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,170
I saw it.

126
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:19,470
I just saw it.

127
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:19,990
I saw it.

128
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,330
It was a purchase.

129
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,910
I told you.

130
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:22,790
It was a purchase.

131
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,410
I heard it from Rima.

132
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,670
Did you hear it?

133
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:46,600
I heard it from Rima.

134
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,960
Everyone is happy.

135
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,760
Raise your hand if you like panties.

136
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,400
Raise your hand.

137
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,990
I saw it.

138
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,310
I saw it.

139
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,970
I saw the panties.

140
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,870
I have a lot of money.

141
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:26,320
What are you talking about?

142
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,360
I have a lot of money.

143
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,340
I have a lot of money.

144
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,260
I have a lot of money.

145
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,760
I have a lot of money.

146
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
I have a lot of money.

147
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
I have a lot of money.

148
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,770
I have a lot of money.

149
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,570
I have a lot of money.

150
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,510
I have a lot of money.

151
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,910
I have a lot of money.

152
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:53,911
I have a lot of money.

153
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,210
I have a lot of money.

154
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,660
What were you guys doing just now?

155
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,810
I'm asking you what you were doing.

156
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,650
Nothing.

157
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,610
I was thinking of selling my underwear.

158
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,410
You haven't sold it yet.

159
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,650
Did you buy it? No, I didn't.

160
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,640


161
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,230
You're such a liar.

162
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

163
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

164
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,710
You're a girl, but you're
wearing panties and you're lying.

165
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,270
You're a coward.

166
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

167
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,070
I'm not lying.

168
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,130
I don't need your excuses.

169
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,250
Do you know how to
make money? No, I don't.

170
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,190
I'm sorry.

171
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:05,550
I have a lot of work to do.

172
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,790
Women... What?

173
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,110
What? What? What? Women.

174
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
..

175
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,870
...earn a lot of money.

176
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
A lot of money?

177
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,590
80's women earn a lot of money.

178
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,810
What? I've never heard of it.

179
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,670
I'll teach you the movement of Kijoi.

180
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,470
Come here.

181
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,410
Yes!

182
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,910
I'm looking forward to it.

183
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,290
Kijoi?

184
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,970
I'll show you Kijoi in Tokyo.

185
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,290
Thank you.

186
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:12,300
Take off your clothes.

187
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,920
Take off your clothes.

188
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,860
Take off your clothes.

189
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:26,920
Take off your coat.

190
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
It's summer.

191
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,900
It's summer.

192
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,400
Take off your coat.

193
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Take off your coat.

194
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
That's all you need.

195
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,480
That's all you need.

196
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:53,430
That's all you need.

197
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,150
That's all you need.

198
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,970
You graduated from a
boring life, didn't you?

199
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,170
Yes.

200
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,090
You're a virgin, aren't you?

201
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,350
No, I'm not a virgin.

202
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,410
Most men have weak nipples. Remember that.

203
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,630
Yes!

204
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,610
Do you know who was
born in the 1980s? No, I don't.

205
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,910


206
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,050
It's that Samoari!

207
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,470
What?

208
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:33,030
So, men in the 80s are usually short-nosed.

209
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:41,880
Are you serious? I'll show you.

210
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,300
I'll show you.

211
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,660
I'll show you.

212
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,080
Can you see it? No, I can't.

213
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,380
I can't see it.

214
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:03,381
Senpai.

215
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
It feels good.

216
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,920


217
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
It's coming out.

218
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Is it coming out?

219
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Is it coming
out? I can't see it.

220
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040


221
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,960
I want to see it.

222
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Show me.

223
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
It's true.

224
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,940
It's really coming out.

225
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,020
It's really coming out.

226
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,940
You have a good voice.

227
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,620
You can be a man.

228
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,040
Your face is red. Are you okay?

229
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,460
You can do it, right?

230
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll do my best.

231
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,961
Glasses are important,
right? Yes, they are.

232
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080


233
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,480
What are you doing?

234
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Wow!

235
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,840
Wow!

236
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,880
Wow! I feel so good.

237
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,300


238
00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:28,860
You look so good.

239
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,240
I was so nervous.

240
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,880
Are you serious?

241
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Serious?

242
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,240
I haven't done it yet.

243
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,380
What?

244
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:41,540
What? Is this it?

245
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,720
You still have 20 minutes to sleep.

246
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
What?

247
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,660
Get ready, Kanae.

248
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Yes.

249
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
Wow!

250
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,380
What? It's too early.

251
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,620
It's too early.

252
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,300
This is.

253
00:36:58,585 --> 00:36:59,585
..

254
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,300
not included.

255
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,380
What?

256
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,540
Senpai, it's not included.

257
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
It's not allowed, right?

258
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,640
They are definitely pretending.

259
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,840
Let's watch it together.

260
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,120
Are you sure? Let's watch it.

261
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,121
Excuse me.

262
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,190


263
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,760
Is this a human skill?

264
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,240
My butt is shaking.

265
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,680
Are you serious?

266
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,980
This is the technique I learned today.

267
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Wow!

268
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,060
You guys should try it too.

269
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:40,300
Can you do it?

270
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Can you do it?

271
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,840
You can do it as if I taught you.

272
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Can you do it? I'll show you.

273
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360


274
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,640
Well, well, well.

275
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,680
I've known you for a long time.

276
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,120
I don't know how to do it.

277
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Please.

278
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Wait.

279
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,880
First of all, sex starts with a
kiss, doesn't it? But senpai.

280
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,040
..

281
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,021
No, but senpai... Until
you show me your face.

282
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
I see.

283
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm sorry.

284
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm sorry.

285
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Thank you.

286
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,771
I'm going to look at you a lot.

287
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,060
I'm going to look at
your happy faces a lot.

288
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,700
Senpai, what should I do if I kiss
you and my mouth is full of saliva?

289
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,240
I'll give it to you.

290
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,060
What?

291
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,256
I'll give it to you and make you drink it.

292
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Give it to me? No way.

293
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,240


294
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,500
Should I put it in my mouth?

295
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,500
I want to see it.

296
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,220
I want to see it.

297
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:58,820
I want to see it.

298
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,720
It's like water.

299
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,120
I drank it.

300
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,080
Thank you very much.

301
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
You look happy.

302
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:09,880
What?

303
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,796
Isn't it fun to kiss
with everyone? I see.

304
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,420
I see.

305
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:17,080


306
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,820
Wow, you have a very kind face.

307
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,520
Wow, you are sitting very comfortably.

308
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,540
You like to be touched,
don't you? It's true.

309
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,580


310
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,480
I can't stand it.

311
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,880
My body is shaking.

312
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,060
Next is Sera.

313
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,820
All of us?

314
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,171
It's better if all of us do it.

315
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,830
Wow!

316
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,870
Look at her pitiful face!

317
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,910
Wow!

318
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,790
It's just like she was born.

319
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,570
You can try harder.

320
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,210
Harder?

321
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,510
It feels good, doesn't
it? It feels good.

322
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,770


323
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,330
Wow!

324
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:49,090
If you make such a voice,
your throat will be dry again.

325
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:50,930
Open your mouth.

326
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,931
You still have a long way to go.

327
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,670
Come here.

328
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,190
You want more, don't you?

329
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,486
You want to put up with more, don't you?

330
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,510
Show me your face.

331
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:03,870
Can I? Like this.

332
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,330


333
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,210
Wow!

334
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,870
It's coming out.

335
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,150
What?

336
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,070
It's coming out.

337
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,550
No, no, no.

338
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
She said no.

339
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,370
She said you should put up with it.

340
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,690
Hang in there! Hang in there!

341
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:33,980
Hang in there! Hang in there!

342
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
You did it!

343
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,760
Come on!

344
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Ready!

345
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
Go!

346
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,740
Go!

347
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,120
Who's going first?

348
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,380
Who's motivated?

349
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:48,760
I don't have it.

350
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,320
Yes, you do.

351
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,250
Then, I'll go first.

352
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:14,970
Are you sure?

353
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,430
It's easy to see.

354
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,410
I'll put it on my back.

355
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,370
Yes.

356
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,710
It's good.

357
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Ms. Uwakori,

358
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,850
Do you have a rubber band?

359
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,670
I don't have anything.

360
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:28,650
What?

361
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,110
I'm sure I have a rubber band.

362
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,910
And I'm not a girl today.

363
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,450
Oh, I see.

364
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,430
I'm sorry.

365
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:36,630
This is the first time I've ever done this.

366
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,391
You haven't put it in yet?

367
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,730
I'm going to put it in.

368
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,390
I'm making a voice.

369
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,630
You can't make a real voice.

370
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,690
Does it feel good?
It feels good.

371
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,690
Really?

372
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,590
Does it feel good?

373
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,650
How does it feel?

374
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:02,651
What's wrong? It's too hot.

375
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,290


376
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,150
Too hot?

377
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,350
Too hot?

378
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,230
Too hot? It's too tight.

379
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,270


380
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,190
It's too tight?

381
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,110
Is there a place like
that? Yes, there is.

382
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,730
Where? There.

383
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,070


384
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:15,730


385
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,430
Do you know where
it is? It's amazing.

386
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:16,990
I'll lick you.

387
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,470


388
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:19,570
Yes.

389
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,570
Can I kiss you?

390
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,350
Do you want me to kiss you?

391
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,351
Yes.

392
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,250
I'm so happy that I'm so
tiny in my mother's womb.

393
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,810
Touch me.

394
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,610
I wanted to do this.

395
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,930
This is Akari's.

396
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:44,931
Oh, it's this one.

397
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:45,410
It's cute.

398
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,190
Wow.

399
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,950
It looks a little dangerous.

400
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,790
Wow.

401
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,090
Wait a minute.

402
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,750
It's too early to use it yet.

403
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,030
Next.

404
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,630
Yes.

405
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,030
Wow.

406
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,230
It's amazing.

407
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,310
You like sundae,
don't you? Next.

408
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,470


409
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,430
Then, I'll put it on.

410
00:44:12,431 --> 00:44:13,431
Let's go!

411
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,550
I want to touch it.

412
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,880
Did you feel it? Of course.

413
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360


414
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Wow! It was amazing.

415
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,480


416
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,220
Really?

417
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
Yes.

418
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
It moved quickly.

419
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,920
Thank you.

420
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:45,815
Wow, it's wet.

421
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,520
I know it's cold, but are you all right?

422
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,380
It feels so good.

423
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Hey, you guys.

424
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,100
You can't see Hameshiro
if you put your panties here.

425
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

426
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
That's right.

427
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,940
We're going to show Hameshiro.

428
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Like this? Oh, no.

429
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,500
I'm so scared.

430
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:15,501
I'm so scared.

431
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,600


432
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,380
Let's lick our nipples together.

433
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,561
I can't believe that
Akari-senpai noticed this so soon.

434
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,640
I'm scared.

435
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,160
She's making a lot of noise.

436
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,240
She's making a lot of noise.

437
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,180
I want to make a noise.

438
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,500
Akari-senpai is so cute.

439
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,540
I might cry.

440
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,820
What do you mean? I'm scared.

441
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:44,760
I can't do it anymore.

442
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,700
You should attack more.

443
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,480
I can't do it anymore.

444
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,440
Go, go, go.

445
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,150
Alice, you shouldn't do that.

446
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:12,520
You should let a man
do it first, then a woman.

447
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,300
I'm going to show you how to do it.

448
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:18,840
First, let the man go, then the woman.

449
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,460
I'm sorry.

450
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,940
You have a weak neck.

451
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,400
Show him how to do it.

452
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
I'm sorry.

453
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,900
Do you want to go next?

454
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:31,600
Yes.

455
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,200
Then, I'll go next.

456
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,080
Is this okay? That's great.

457
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,180


458
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,620
I'll go this way.

459
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
I want more.

460
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,440
I want more.

461
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:50,441
Senpai is asking you.

462
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,580
I want more.

463
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:53,581
I want more.

464
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,020
I want more.

465
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,320
I want to touch you so much.

466
00:47:00,115 --> 00:47:01,500
I love you so much.

467
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,501
I love you so much.

468
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,140
I love you so much.

469
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,580
Wow!

470
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Wow!

471
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,790
That angle!

472
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:22,791
What do you mean? Look.

473
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,150
It's amazing.

474
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,970
It's great.

475
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,410
Ah, glasses.

476
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:31,510
Ah, wait.

477
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,640


478
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,040
I'm going to die.

479
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
You're going to die.

480
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
You have a cold.

481
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,160
It's after you become a man.

482
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,900
Yes, senpai.

483
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,100
I understand.

484
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:54,160
I'm going to cry!

485
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,400
I'm going to cry!

486
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,760
I'm going to cry!

487
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,700
I'm going to cry!

488
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
I'm going to cry!

489
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
I'm going to cry!

490
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,080
I'm going to cry!

491
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
I'm going to cry!

492
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,140
I'm going to cry!

493
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,180
I'm going to cry!

494
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,620
I'm going to cry!

495
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:10,780
I'm going to cry!

496
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:10,900
I'm going to cry!

497
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:10,980
I'm going to cry!

498
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,140
I'm going to cry!

499
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
I'm going to cry!

500
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
I'm going to cry!

501
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,580
I'm going to cry!

502
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,440
I'm going to cry!

503
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,280
I'm going to cry!

504
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm going to cry!

505
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,180
Can I touch your
boobs? Yes, you can.

506
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520


507
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,300
Wow, it's beautiful.

508
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,071
Can you feel the softness
of my boobs? Yes, I can.

509
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:38,980


510
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
Can I touch your
boobs? Yes, you can.

511
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Here we go.

512
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,440


513
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
OK.

514
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Wow!

515
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,560
Wow!

516
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,880
How do you feel?

517
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,100
How do you feel?

518
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,380
At first, it was narrow and warm.

519
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:03,560
It was narrow.

520
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,980
It was narrow.

521
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,580
Am I narrow?

522
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,020
Yes.

523
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
Hang in there.

524
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,320
It was very hard.

525
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:21,321
Wow! Wait a minute.

526
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,990


527
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,130
Is it really scary?

528
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:32,810
I'm going to fall out.

529
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:32,990
What?

530
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,070
I'm going to fall out.

531
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:35,790
Wait a minute.

532
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,630
Are you going to fall out?

533
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,150
Is it OK?

534
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,170
Is it really OK?

535
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,270
I'm going to fall out.

536
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,710
Wait.

537
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,520
I want to see it.

538
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,560
Oh, it's coming out.

539
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,920
It's glasses.

540
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,040
You can't stand it, can you?

541
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,600
It's coming out.

542
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,860
This is the crow. It's warm.

543
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,700
It's amazing.

544
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,080
It's amazing.

545
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:22,081
Wow!

546
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,020
Wow!

547
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,050
Thank you, Senpai!

548
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,890
This is the end!

549
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,850
Wow! It feels good.

550
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,490


551
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:39,390
Did you feel good? I felt good.

552
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,670
I'm glad.

553
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,290
Thank you very much.

554
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,450
Thank you very much.

555
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,930
Thank you very much.

556
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,350
Not yet.

557
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:50,351
I'm not sure.

558
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,190
I'm sorry.

559
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,930
I'm sure it's not enough.

560
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,550
It's not enough.

561
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,710
I'm sorry.

562
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,350
I'm sorry.

563
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,090
I'm sorry.

564
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:04,590
I'm sorry.

565
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,750
I'm sorry.

566
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,970
I feel good.

567
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,630
It's ticklish.

568
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,090
It's ticklish.

569
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,850
It's ticklish.

570
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,070
Senpai, you are better than me.

571
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,510
Wow, amazing.

572
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,171
Senpai, you are getting used to it.

573
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,730
Yes.

574
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,010
It feels good.

575
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,790
Wow, amazing.

576
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,090
I'm sorry.

577
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:41,210
Here you are.

578
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,110
It's so scattered.

579
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,350
It's so scattered.

580
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:57,670
This is it.

581
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,010
Wow!

582
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:04,170
It's dangerous if you see it.

583
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,830
Dangerous?

584
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,490
Does that mean we're not used to it?

585
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,750
Is it the best in the world?

586
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:09,990
It's the best!

587
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,150
Is it the best in the world?

588
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,010
It's the best in the world.

589
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:16,810
I'm so happy.

590
00:52:16,811 --> 00:52:17,811
I'm happy.

591
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:22,230
It's like a baby's booger.

592
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:31,370
It looks like a baby's booger.

593
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,410
It's like a baby's booger.

594
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:34,830
I'm so scared.

595
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,500
I'm sorry.

596
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:39,460
I'll have a bath.

597
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,980
Oh, no.

598
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:52,020
I'm going to have a bath.

599
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,580
Oh, no.

600
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:55,581
It's the second bath.

601
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
Great.

602
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,820
Oh.

603
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,680
Oh.

604
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,220
Oh.

605
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:08,640
Oh.

606
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:09,400
Oh.

607
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:10,480
Oh.

608
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:10,600
Oh.

609
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,490
Wow, it's amazing.

610
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,500
Wow, it's amazing.

611
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,080
It's better to take off your pants
than to take off your underwear, isn't it?

612
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Yes!

613
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,420
It's better to take off your pants
than to take off your underwear.

614
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,640
MISOWA, a phantom
thief Let's start.

615
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,050


616
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,030
Don't do that!

617
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,410
Don't do that! Hey, move away.

618
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,131
Move!

619
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,410
Then, I'll let you out.

620
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,750
Thank you.

621
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,410
Let me out, too.

622
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,270
I'll let you all out.

623
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,130
I want to be in the center.

624
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,850
Do you want to be in the center?

625
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,750
I want to be in the center.

626
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,290
I want to be in the center.

627
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,291
I spilled it.

628
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,410
So, you are the center, right?

629
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,450
Shut up!

630
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,370
What about me?

631
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,530
Solo?

632
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,730
No way!

633
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,310
You want to be solo?

634
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:05,910
No way!

635
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,650
OK, I'll let you be solo.

636
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,090
You are a great producer.

637
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,090
It's great that you give me a job.

638
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,470
You are the man among men.

639
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,390
You are right.

640
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,640
I want to be on a TV show.

641
00:56:49,940 --> 00:57:03,790
I want to be on a variety of TV shows.

642
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,110
Like a singing show.

643
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:06,370
I'm good at singing.

644
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:07,930
Me, too.

645
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,770
Me, too.

646
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,310
I can dance.

647
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,050
Dance?

648
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,530
I can dance, too.

649
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,410
I'm the best.

650
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,210
What? I'm the best.

651
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,090
No, it's not.

652
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,410


653
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,770
How do you like
it? I like it, too.

654
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,690


655
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,050
How do you like it?

656
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,670
Do you want me to wear it?

657
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,650
Who smells the
best? It's too hot.

658
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:43,910


659
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,490
Who do you like the most?

660
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:28,491
I like Oppai, too.

661
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:29,810
Ms.Kawashina.

662
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,750
Ms.Kozachi, right? Me, too.

663
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,310


664
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,190
Who do you like the most?

665
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,750
Please make a program called Oppai Heaven.

666
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,310
Me! I'm the MC.

667
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:49,630


668
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,490
I came up with it.

669
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,430
Let's play games together.

670
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,110
Really?

671
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,810
Do you want me to do it?

672
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,060
Do you want to
see it? It's true.

673
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,500
It's great.

674
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,650


675
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:10,170
I'll do it for you.

676
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,110
But I don't like it.

677
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:15,510
Hey, stop it.

678
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,930
It's a game, so we have to be fair.

679
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,570
Hey, it's a game.

680
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:28,610
Well, let's go, producer.

681
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,290
Let's go.

682
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,970
One, two.

683
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:35,130
If you want to play baseball,

684
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,070
I agree to this kind of game.

685
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:40,330
Out!

686
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:41,310
Sale!

687
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,050
Yoyoi no Yoi!

688
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,330
Yoyoi no Yoi!

689
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,680
Don't take off your clothes.

690
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,441
What do you want to see, Hoshida-san?

691
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,780
I want to see your boobs.

692
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,740
You are so honest.

693
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,680
Are you talking about this?

694
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,940
Then, I will show you my boobs.

695
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,340
Your boobs? This way.

696
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,700


697
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,220
I'm going to take it off.

698
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,620
It's a big pudding.

699
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:37,690
And this underwear is a
present for the producer.

700
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,060
But there are still items left.

701
01:00:53,855 --> 01:00:54,980
I want to take it off quickly.

702
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:55,981
It's hard.

703
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,240
Let's do it again.

704
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:24,690
I wanted to lose.

705
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:30,130
Mishida-san, you wanted
to see it, didn't you?

706
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,950
Today, I made a lot of strings!

707
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:40,010
Do you want to join us?

708
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,820
Hurry up and take it off.

709
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,400
I don't want to mess it up.

710
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,300
I really like to mess it up.

711
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,270
New panties?

712
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,570
This crotch part.

713
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:27,480
Let's hit it.

714
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:50,700
I can't see.

715
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,320
I'll hit it.

716
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,280
One, two.

717
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,400
If you want to play baseball,

718
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,100
you have to do it like this.

719
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,200
Happy New Year!

720
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:04,240
Out! Safe!

721
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,820
Yoyoi no Yoi!

722
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,480
Yoyoi no Yoi!

723
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,720
Happy New Year!

724
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,410
We've been waiting for this moment.

725
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:29,690
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

726
01:03:29,691 --> 01:03:30,950
We'll let you go.

727
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:33,490
Please.

728
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,551
Koishida-san's...
It's Koishida-san!

729
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,480
Four producers! It's so manly.

730
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,730


731
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,020
Can I climb to the top?

732
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,420
I want to climb, too.

733
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,080
Please don't make fun of my producer.

734
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,120
What's going on?

735
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,020
Who called a child? I'm an idol.

736
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:34,880


737
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,700
Idol? I'm an idol.

738
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,340


739
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,480
Idol?

740
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:42,360
No, I don't want to.

741
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,400
What's with that tacky dress?

742
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:46,540
What?

743
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,880
Why are you wearing it, Producer?

744
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:53,140
No, no, this is... Hey,
did you miss the time?

745
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,480
Go play at the park.

746
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,860
Why don't you play at
the slide? I'll play, but.

747
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,640
..

748
01:04:58,641 --> 01:04:59,641
You'll play?

749
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:03,820
But I'm an idol, and I have
a bond with you, Producer.

750
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,906
I won't lose to you
girls in this tacky dress.

751
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,460
I'm not going to lose to you girls.

752
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:13,960
Unfortunately, I like erotic girls like us.

753
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:16,400
I'm not a kid!

754
01:05:16,401 --> 01:05:17,401
I'll never lose!

755
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,440
Today, I'll not perform on the stage.

756
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,920
I'll throw away the microphone.

757
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,300
I'll use a chimpanzee
to compete with the girls.

758
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,740
I'm not a kid!

759
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,600
I'm not a kid!

760
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:31,860
I'm not a kid!

761
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:32,120
I'm not a kid!

762
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,320
I'm not a kid!

763
01:05:33,321 --> 01:05:40,480
I'm not a kid!

764
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:41,481
I'm not a kid!

765
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,800
I'm not a kid!

766
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,241
Don't put your hat in too deep.

767
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,080
That's right.

768
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,360
You like a fierce face, don't you?

769
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,760
I can hide this hand.

770
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
Try it.

771
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,500
This is how you do a fierce face.

772
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,460
What are you talking about?

773
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,260
This is how you do a fierce face.

774
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,261
Stop it!

775
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,800
You let an idol do such a thing.

776
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,620
Do you like such
people? That's right.

777
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,320


778
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,920
If I die, I can't go back, can I?

779
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,300
I can lick your toes, too.

780
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,500
I can lick your toes, too.

781
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,760
You feel good, don't you?

782
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,460
I feel good when I do this.

783
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,700
I can't get my hands and feet out.

784
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,700
You can't get your hands
and feet out, can you?

785
01:06:55,701 --> 01:06:58,860
If you can't get your hands and
feet out, try to get your mouth out.

786
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,660
You can't do that.

787
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,240
You can't shake your head.

788
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,640
I can't shake my head.

789
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,060
It's dangerous.

790
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,640
Do you want me to show
you something better?

791
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,560
You are an idol anyway.

792
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,220
You've never seen a flower, have you?

793
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,400
Enough! Enough!

794
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,100
Please be tired.

795
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,320
Why?

796
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,460
You could have let me lick you a little.

797
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:41,941
It doesn't matter if you don't do it.

798
01:07:47,820 --> 01:08:15,220
I can do it.

799
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,301
It's dangerous if you do it like that.

800
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,080
I think I'm going to cry.

801
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,380
Why?

802
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:41,120
Come on, get in front of me.

803
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,920
I'm not interested.

804
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,240
Show me your idol boobs.

805
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:47,360
Show me your teeth.

806
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,600
Don't do that.
My mouth will make you feel better.

807
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,520
Don't do that.
My teeth will make you feel better.

808
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,580
Give it back to me.

809
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,000
Give it back to me.

810
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,500
I'll put it under your teeth.

811
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,560
Really? Try it.

812
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,360
Try it.

813
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,740


814
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,180
Have you ever been
there? Yes, I have.

815
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,720


816
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,160
Really? Yes, I have.

817
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,420


818
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,340
Do you know the feeling
of going there? Yes, I do.

819
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,660
I feel like my stomach
is going to explode.

820
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,240
Really?

821
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,860
Then, why don't you lick me?

822
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,780
Then, please lick me.

823
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,660
Are you really okay?

824
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:03,640
You will lick me, won't you?

825
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:04,800
I don't want to.

826
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:05,801
How is it, Rori-manko?

827
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,080
It's great!

828
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:09,860
Your butt is still blue, isn't it?

829
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,100
It's still blue, isn't it?

830
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,520
She says it's delicious.

831
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,180
Idol's manko is delicious.

832
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,240
She says it feels good.

833
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,690
This way, this way, this way.

834
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:41,690
Put on your footwear.

835
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,010
Excuse me.

836
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,690
Please put me in.

837
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,690
Please put me in.

838
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,050
Please put me in.

839
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,250
I'm happy.

840
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,990
There is no place to fail.

841
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,290
There is.

842
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:09,050
Please put me in.

843
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,390
Please put me in.

844
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:13,610
Please put me in.

845
01:11:13,611 --> 01:11:14,870
Wait a minute.

846
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,060
I'll put it in.

847
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,220
What are you doing?

848
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,641
I'm the first one to put
all of the producer's.

849
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:39,040
Wait a minute.

850
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,520
Wasn't it 100,000?

851
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,100
It's not 100,000.

852
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,380
Now we're finally in the same body.

853
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,460
It feels good.

854
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:48,940
No way.

855
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,236
You'll put it in, won't
you? I'll put it in.

856
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:50,680
Show me.

857
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:51,860
Show me.

858
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:52,840


859
01:11:53,100 --> 01:12:12,760
It doesn't feel good,
does it? It feels good.

860
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:13,761


861
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:14,900
We are better than usual.

862
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,390
We are better than usual.

863
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,190
We are better than usual.

864
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,130
We are better than usual.

865
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,990
We are better than usual.

866
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,290
We are better than usual.

867
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,150
We are better than usual.

868
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:02,151
We are better than usual.

869
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:02,630
We are better than usual.

870
01:13:02,631 --> 01:13:03,210
We are better than usual.

871
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:03,270
We are better than usual.

872
01:13:03,271 --> 01:13:03,830
We are better than usual.

873
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,190
We are better than usual.

874
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,610
We are better than usual.

875
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,150
We are better than usual.

876
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,590
We are better than usual.

877
01:13:11,591 --> 01:13:12,591
I don't think so.

878
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,650
I don't think so.

879
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,510
I'll help you at least.

880
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:18,190
I can't help it.

881
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,510
Look at me when you're in a good mood.

882
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,370
I don't want to.

883
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:38,180
Come on, come on.

884
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,381
Can you keep up with my speed?

885
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,520
Come on, come on, come on.

886
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,340
Look at me when I'm in a good mood.

887
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,020
Look at me when I'm in a good mood.

888
01:13:54,021 --> 01:13:55,700
I can't stop.

889
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,320
This is a slow-motion team dance.

890
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:18,340
This is a slow-motion team dance.

891
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:56,360
This is a slow-motion team dance.

892
01:14:56,361 --> 01:15:20,590
I don't want to play with you.

893
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,791
Shall I give you a tight
hug with our manko?

894
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,600
It's an idol manko.

895
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:14,100
It's just a drop anyway.

896
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,400
That's right.

897
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,360
There's a lot of it.

898
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,160
It's a lie to say a lot.

899
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,160
It's too much.

900
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,640
What a waste.

901
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,680
I want a mobile phone!

902
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,560
Mobile phone! Mobile phone!

903
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,200
What a waste!

904
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,750
If you become an idol, you can do it.

905
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:53,560
I can't open it.

906
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,520
It can't be helped.

907
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,000
You've been holding back
a lot, so you can't do that.

908
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,860
It's definitely overwritten.

909
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,240
No, it's not.

910
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,780
I overwrote it.

911
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,280
No, you can't.

912
01:17:04,505 --> 01:17:05,520
I failed.

913
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:06,820
It's no good.

914
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,940
It's the end for us.

915
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,800
I don't want to eat beans.

916
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,540
No, it's no good.

917
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It's no good.

918
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:27,790
The baby couldn't be satisfied.

919
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,740
It's a big baby.

920
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:22,870
Why don't you talk to me anymore?

921
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:30,170
I don't have much time to talk to you.

922
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,720
Why don't you give me a foot massage?

923
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,090
Tell me how you feel
that I don't let you go.

924
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,950
Wasn't a foot massage enough?

925
01:18:46,010 --> 01:19:03,935
It's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good,
it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's

926
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:21,830
not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's
not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not

927
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:50,010
I'm so happy.

928
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,470
I'm so happy.

929
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:04,510
I'm so happy.

930
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:10,090
I'm so happy.

931
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,310
I'm so happy.

932
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,770
I'm so happy.

933
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:13,910
I'm so happy.

934
01:20:13,911 --> 01:20:13,950
I'm so happy.

935
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:14,951
Why?

936
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,150
Come on, let's have fun.

937
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,530
You feel good, don't you?

938
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:26,290
Why do you feel good?

939
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,110
Let us go out whenever you want.

940
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:31,230
Let's go, let's go.

941
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:45,510
Go on, go on.

942
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,610
Don't be shy.

943
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:50,611
Don't cry.

944
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:53,610
I can't.

945
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,610
I can't.

946
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:57,190
I can't.

947
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:58,570
Don't cry.

948
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,930
I can't.

949
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:04,570
I can't.

950
01:21:04,571 --> 01:21:05,930
I can't.

951
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:09,550
Marumi.

952
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,550
Marumi.

953
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:15,970
Marumi.

954
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,600
Good bye.

955
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:19,770
Let's give her a hug.

956
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,680
I think she is lonely.

957
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:53,471
Let's make her feel better.

958
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:03,420
I'm sorry.

959
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,440
If you're upset, you can take this.

960
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,110
I'll take this.

961
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,400
If you don't want to
dance, you can go home.

962
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:16,080
I don't want to dance.

963
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:20,220
I don't want to go home.

964
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,980
I'll show you my sexy dance.

965
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,230
I'm happy.

966
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,180
I'm happy.

967
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:43,182
I'm a producer, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a
sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex

968
01:22:43,194 --> 01:22:59,400
worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker,
I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm a sex worker, I'm

969
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:02,440
Can I spit it out as it is?

970
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,840
No, you have to spit it out with a manko.

971
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,640
Here is the best manko.

972
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,540
Here is also.

973
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,420
Where?

974
01:23:49,115 --> 01:23:51,340
There's one here, too,
but why isn't there one?

975
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,570
It feels so good, doesn't it?

976
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,630
As I thought, you're a
birdie with a sexy body.

977
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,970
I have a good one, too.

978
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,850
Hey, Toyo-chan, you're humiliating me.

979
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,470
I'm humiliating you,
but I don't want to lose.

980
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,250
As I thought, this jump is amazing.

981
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,550
Come on, come on.

982
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,740
It's a little bit hot.

983
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,500
It's hot.

984
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:16,080
It's so heavy.

985
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,260
It's overflowing.

986
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,900
It's overflowing.

987
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:25,600
I'm so happy.

988
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,760
Hey, idol.

989
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,920
Your favorite producer
has made other girls cry.

990
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,920
Really?

991
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,200
Why did you make other girls cry?

992
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:36,340
I don't want it.

993
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:38,820
Don't you want it? It's a waste.

994
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,840


995
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,900
If you don't want it, I'll lick it.

996
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:53,800
That's all?

997
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,980
It's said that leftovers are bitter.

998
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,556
You said you had a lot
of things to do, didn't you?

999
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,980
I still have a lot of things to do.

1000
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,220
You look a little cute.

1001
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,040
I'm hungry.

1002
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:08,220
I'm hungry.

1003
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:11,780
Why don't you stop
me? You're amazing.

1004
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,000


1005
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,920
I'm going to these girls.

1006
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,240
I don't know what a producer is.

1007
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,220
I'll quit.

1008
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,861
I'm going to form a group with these girls.

1009
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,760
Welcome.

1010
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,200
Welcome!

1011
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:54,780
Are you sad, producer?

1012
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,701
Look back at me with your small steps.

1013
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,660
Show me your cool side.

1014
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,420
Look back at me with your small steps.

1015
01:27:09,421 --> 01:27:10,421
Please rewind.

1016
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,460
Please rewind.

1017
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,060
Can you do it?

1018
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,400
How is it?

1019
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,580
I'm afraid of the answer.

1020
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,060
You can't rewind,
can you? I can't do it.

1021
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,210
I can't do it.

1022
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:24,590
Please do more.

1023
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,200


1024
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,580
Everyone says more.

1025
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,680
I can't do it.

1026
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:11,600
She is a producer, but in
the end, she is our manko.

1027
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,440
We have the opposite opinion.

1028
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,180
We have the opposite opinion.

1029
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,480
That's strange.

1030
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,140
Producer, we will make
you feel good with our manko.

1031
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,620
You look pathetic.

1032
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,680
Look, manko is beautiful.

1033
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,240
Look at Mac's beautiful butt.

1034
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,000
Why don't you look at me?

1035
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,120
Mac is right in front of you.

1036
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,200
Look at me.

1037
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,760
I'm not good at this.

1038
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,460
Look at me.

1039
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:58,660
You can fix it as it is.

1040
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,520
No, no, no.

1041
01:29:01,521 --> 01:29:02,521
Open your eyes.

1042
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:52,550
If you fart like that,
I'll leave right away.

1043
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:55,190
Then I'll fart in order in the back.

1044
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:59,690
Then I'll fart in order, too.

1045
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:00,850
Oh, it feels good.

1046
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,940
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

1047
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:23,360
That's the real chirping train.

1048
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,040
Don't smoke.

1049
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,960
It's so comfortable.

1050
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:38,110
I have to take out my sperm
before I get on the train.

1051
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:43,430
I'm going to jack this train.

1052
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,460
My sperm has been squeezed out.

1053
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,440
You look like you've been squeezed out.

1054
01:31:49,200 --> 01:32:10,340
I have to take out a lot of sperm.

1055
01:32:10,341 --> 01:32:11,341
I'm so happy!

1056
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,660
I want a croissant, too!

1057
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,780
I want a noodle, too!

1058
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,800
Me, too!

1059
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,780
Please!

1060
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:30,900
Me, too!

1061
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:36,900
I want the rest of the soup.

1062
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:38,400
Give me the rest of the soup.

1063
01:32:38,401 --> 01:32:39,401
Give it to me.

1064
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,310
Hey, hey.

1065
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:48,250
Let's do it together.

1066
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:04,030
Let's do it again.

1067
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:08,590
Let's do it again.

1068
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,950
Let's do it again.

1069
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:17,750
I want you to give me a lot of milk tea.

1070
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:20,910
You're a stubborn boss.

1071
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,290
You made me a mess, so
please take responsibility.

1072
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,990
Thank you, new member.

1073
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:32,590
This time, the five of
us will make our debut.

1074
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,910
And you're the producer.

1075
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,830
I want to get along with you more.

1076
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:48,860
I'm so happy!

1077
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,660
I'm so happy!

1078
01:33:51,600 --> 01:34:13,760
I'm so happy!

1079
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,580
I'm so happy!

1080
01:36:31,050 --> 01:37:00,530

The next day

1128
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:22,220
Darling,

1129
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:25,580
Do you want to go out with me?

1130
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:31,880
We haven't decided yet, have we?

1131
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,960
Let's come here!

1132
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,240
It's fun!

1133
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:39,900
Let's enjoy! Let's drink.

1134
02:00:39,901 --> 02:00:40,901


1135
02:00:59,190 --> 02:01:00,990
Your face is getting red, isn't it?

1136
02:01:04,230 --> 02:01:05,431
You have a very colorful face.

1137
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:07,710
Did I make you drink too much?

1138
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:18,040
It's just a little. It's special.

1139
02:01:28,535 --> 02:01:30,360
How is it? Chikira's little bunny.

1140
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:40,020
I've seen a lot of them, and just
looking at them isn't enough, is it?

1141
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,440
No.

1142
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:43,280
I think it's better.

1143
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:45,660
No.

1144
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,160
I think I'll have more fun.

1145
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:54,200
I want you to touch me with your big hands.

1146
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:00,140
I want you to feel good.

1147
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:29,000
Ah, it feels good.

1148
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,620
Your eyes are beautiful.

1149
02:02:40,975 --> 02:02:42,520
We are also.

1150
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:44,900
It's refreshing.

1151
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,660
My husband is making me relax.

1152
02:02:54,235 --> 02:02:56,020
You want to lie down, don't you?

1153
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:57,700
You must be tired.

1154
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,760
Come here.

1155
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:08,240
All of us...

1156
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,640
There are only three of us here.

1157
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:17,140
Don't be shy.

1158
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,940
It's okay.

1159
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,980
Please show me a lot.

1160
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:30,580
First of all, where do you want to touch?

1161
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:37,300
Do you like my nipples?

1162
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:45,540
Then, let's touch a lot.

1163
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:56,190
I'll touch you gently.

1164
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:25,440
Are you here?

1165
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,680
Yes.

1166
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:35,790
Oh, it's getting harder.

1167
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:38,110
It's getting warmer.

1168
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:40,330
Yes.

1169
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:43,370
Don't be shy.

1170
02:04:43,371 --> 02:04:44,371
Don't look at me.

1171
02:04:50,825 --> 02:04:52,826
Let me hear your pleasant
voice and pleasant face.

1172
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:17,221
I'm going to ask you
something I don't understand.

1173
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:23,900
What's going on with the katana
under your husband? Great.

1174
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,080


1175
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:36,120
The shape of the katana is
clear even from above the skin.

1176
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:40,260
It looks like it's going to
break through and come out.

1177
02:05:40,261 --> 02:05:41,261
Yes.

1178
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,680
You have a wonderful sword.

1179
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:55,680
We are very interested in this sword.

1180
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:59,020
Can I take a look?

1181
02:05:59,021 --> 02:06:00,021
Can I kiss you? Beautiful.

1182
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,640


1183
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,300
It's like the first sunrise.

1184
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:15,760
I want to sleep.

1185
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:22,180
I want to put a lemon in my
mouth right now, but I can't wait.

1186
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:23,880
Can't wait?

1187
02:06:23,881 --> 02:06:24,881
How do you feel?

1188
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:28,640
Don't be in a hurry.

1189
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:33,180
Let's enjoy it slowly.

1190
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:43,220
It's hot.

1191
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:48,820
The back of your head is strong.

1192
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:51,120
It's wonderful.

1193
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:53,980
Your balls are big.

1194
02:06:56,470 --> 02:06:58,000
Isn't this the best in Edo?

1195
02:06:59,830 --> 02:07:02,900
Is this the rumored Kotetsu?

1196
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:08,720
I've heard of it, but it's
the first time I've seen it.

1197
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,360
It's there, isn't
it? I'm so excited.

1198
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,961
Do you want me
to make it harder?

1199
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:29,360
Please make it harder.

1200
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,360
I'm sorry.

1201
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:36,180
I can't stand it.

1202
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:45,240
I want to smell it, too.

1203
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:51,700
I can't get enough of this smell.

1204
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,200
It's so relaxing.

1205
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:06,160
You want to experience each
person's technique, don't you?

1206
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:16,360
Husband, do you like
deep throat? Deep throat.

1207
02:08:19,065 --> 02:08:20,065


1208
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:34,700
It feels good, doesn't it?
It's my proud move.

1209
02:08:34,701 --> 02:08:35,701
It's a cat.

1210
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:44,920
It's a cat.

1211
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:55,220
My husband's sword is so
long that I can't cut it deep.

1212
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:11,230
How is it?

1213
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:12,830
It's hot, isn't it?

1214
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:21,470
It's no fun if you just lick it, isn't it?

1215
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:23,610
Please enjoy it even if you are blind.

1216
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:29,750
Oh, it's good.

1217
02:09:43,310 --> 02:09:45,890
Tana-san, this side too.

1218
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:55,890
It's a luxury to have both.

1219
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:59,830
Please look at it a lot.

1220
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:09,681
It's time for you to change your clothes.

1221
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:11,690
I'm sorry.

1222
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:16,410
I feel so relaxed.

1223
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:25,820
It's time to get ready.

1224
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:28,600
Let's get ready.

1225
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:48,360
Let's change your clothes.

1226
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:18,900
〈Fuwa〉

1227
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:45,190
〈Fuwa〉

1228
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:50,110
I want you to feel my pulse.

1229
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:01,340
I'm going in.

1230
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,080
Please take a good look.

1231
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:08,300
I'll take my time.

1232
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:20,650
I'm going to make you feel the
warmth of your husband's arms.

1233
02:12:24,070 --> 02:12:25,070
Oh, you're in my arms.

1234
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:33,051
I told you that I won't
let go of your hands.

1235
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:35,271
I told you that I don't
have a fever, didn't I?

1236
02:12:40,905 --> 02:12:54,090
I think I'm going to have a fever, too.

1237
02:12:54,575 --> 02:12:56,390
It's too early to get a fever.

1238
02:12:57,710 --> 02:13:01,730
I'm more sensitive than usual.

1239
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:04,210
Why? Why? I'm sorry.

1240
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:10,350
I'm sorry, darling.

1241
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:14,910
I'll go first.

1242
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:17,340
I'm sorry, darling.

1243
02:13:34,670 --> 02:13:35,951
Hey, hey, you shouldn't do that.

1244
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:39,200
You should go first, darling.

1245
02:13:39,850 --> 02:13:51,300
I'm sorry, but this is the first
time I've ever felt so good.

1246
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:06,680
Can I borrow it? Oh, it's hot.

1247
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:11,660
Oh, it's cool.

1248
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:23,760
Oh, it's cool.

1249
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:27,350
It's so thick.

1250
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:29,780
Look at Sota.

1251
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:39,840


1252
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:49,680
You look like you're going to be
satisfied with just this, don't you?

1253
02:14:51,320 --> 02:14:58,700
I want you to move a lot, too.

1254
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:03,640
Are you all right?

1255
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:08,520
Were you able to put up with
your fierce temper? I'll go first.

1256
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:12,520


1257
02:15:24,650 --> 02:15:28,370
I want you to follow me from behind.

1258
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:45,130
I want you to take a deep breath.

1259
02:15:47,110 --> 02:15:48,110
There are people here.

1260
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:54,650
Oh, my God!

1261
02:15:55,210 --> 02:15:57,170
Oh, my God!

1262
02:15:58,865 --> 02:16:02,230
If you don't move, she'll move on her own.

1263
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:04,210
Oh, I see.

1264
02:16:05,410 --> 02:16:07,410
I'm getting greedy.

1265
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,430
I want more and more.

1266
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,500
I'm useless.

1267
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:37,940
I'm so sorry.

1268
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:45,100
I'm so sorry.

1269
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:49,201
【Harry】 【Harry】

1270
02:17:11,090 --> 02:17:14,091
Please… Give me… The best…

1271
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:16,190
【Harry】

1272
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:28,350
Best…

1273
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:32,230
You have not only a solid
body, but also a great stamina.

1274
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:34,970
You have a great back.

1275
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:39,210
That's a good point.

1276
02:17:40,030 --> 02:17:41,750
I have a good point.

1277
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:44,390
You understand me.

1278
02:17:46,530 --> 02:17:48,310
I want you to be my partner every day.

1279
02:17:49,570 --> 02:17:50,570
Really?

1280
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:56,330
Usuki, please use this
cushion to feel good.

1281
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:08,750
I'm so happy to see your happy face.

1282
02:18:12,770 --> 02:18:14,510
What's that? There, there.

1283
02:18:15,590 --> 02:18:16,910
Help me.

1284
02:18:22,550 --> 02:18:26,450
Please, please.

1285
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:29,350


1286
02:18:30,310 --> 02:18:31,310
Ouch!

1287
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:33,630
Oh, oh, oh! Turn around.

1288
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:34,650
I'm OK.

1289
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:37,010
Please, please.

1290
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,310
Please, please.

1291
02:18:40,311 --> 02:18:41,311


1292
02:18:42,110 --> 02:18:44,350
Oh, oh, oh!

1293
02:18:56,690 --> 02:18:57,590
Oh, oh, oh! It's leaking.

1294
02:18:57,630 --> 02:18:58,630


1295
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:03,690
Oh, oh, oh!

1296
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:04,110
Oh, oh, oh!

1297
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:05,670
Oh, oh, oh!

1298
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:07,150
Oh, oh, oh!

1299
02:19:07,250 --> 02:19:11,590
Oh, my god! It's coming out of my body.

1300
02:19:16,465 --> 02:19:18,030
Oh, my god!

1301
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:21,550
It's so strong and strong.

1302
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:24,250
Oh, my god!

1303
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:26,450
Next, this side.

1304
02:19:27,050 --> 02:19:28,610
Oh, my god!

1305
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:40,690
It's been a long time since
I came to the first class.

1306
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:42,450
It's more than I thought.

1307
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:55,510
I've never been so serious with a customer.

1308
02:19:57,870 --> 02:19:59,130
Oh, I see.

1309
02:20:00,610 --> 02:20:03,370
I'm sure you feel good, too.

1310
02:20:04,540 --> 02:20:05,930
Oh, I see.

1311
02:20:05,931 --> 02:20:06,931
There, there.

1312
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:36,620
Are you all right?

1313
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:41,680
I didn't mean to do this.

1314
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,720
It feels so good.

1315
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:54,150
Is this the second time
you've had a voice like this?

1316
02:20:54,151 --> 02:20:55,151
Did you go out?

1317
02:20:58,150 --> 02:21:00,270
It's amazing to see you two together.

1318
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:05,820
I've never seen a husband like you.

1319
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:10,670
Can I clean your room?

1320
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:16,610
Please make it clean.

1321
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:28,310
Oh, it's hot.

1322
02:21:32,225 --> 02:21:36,890
We got wet with this today.

1323
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:49,050
Let's enjoy more.

1324
02:21:49,051 --> 02:21:50,051
Let's go to bed.

1325
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:52,630
The night is long.

1326
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:29,680
It's so hot today.

1327
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:34,760
It's always hot.

1328
02:22:34,761 --> 02:22:35,761
Let's read it together.

1329
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:37,280
Shall we read the comments.

1330
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:39,756
We might not be able to
read it if we read it together.

1331
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:45,360
You did it.

1332
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:48,300
What is it?

1333
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:55,740
I heard a rumor.

1334
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,420
What is it?

1335
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:02,300
Rumor is that you and
Sunny are living together.

1336
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:08,150
I'm here.

1337
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,320
Isn't it great? Yes, it is.

1338
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:11,740
Let's go home.

1339
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:13,420


1340
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:15,340
I don't want to talk to you.

1341
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:19,260
I heard a rumor.

1342
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:23,680
Three of us are having an extension party.

1343
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:26,070
Is it true?

1344
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,720
Do you want to go out?

1345
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:33,720
I want you to know it.

1346
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:37,980
How much is it?

1347
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:41,880
I don't have to tell you.

1348
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:43,440
Oh, no.

1349
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:45,920
If it's this much, we can
just go without anything.

1350
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,260
It's definitely not enough.

1351
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:50,560
No, it's not.

1352
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:51,660
Eguchi-san, bring it.

1353
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,260
Is three enough? I don't know.

1354
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:55,140
Because.

1355
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:56,240
..

1356
02:23:56,241 --> 02:23:57,280
I can't read that much.

1357
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,520
Then, let's not talk about it.

1358
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:02,680
Let's go home.

1359
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:03,860
Let's go to the tapioca.

1360
02:24:03,861 --> 02:24:04,861
Let's go to the hospital.

1361
02:24:05,660 --> 02:24:08,940
Is there a place where
we can buy it at this price?

1362
02:24:10,470 --> 02:24:12,751
What? Is there a place where
we can buy it at this price?

1363
02:24:14,625 --> 02:24:16,813
If you say that there
is a place where we

1364
02:24:16,825 --> 02:24:19,240
can buy it at this price,
isn't it this much? That's right.

1365
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,220


1366
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:23,020
Isn't it this much?

1367
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:24,540
Isn't this enough?

1368
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,060
It's not that cheap.

1369
02:24:28,061 --> 02:24:29,221
We don't have a lot of money.

1370
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:33,340
We are in need of a lot of money.

1371
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:35,740
You are right.

1372
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:37,520
We can't afford it.

1373
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
How about this?

1374
02:24:40,700 --> 02:24:42,780
No, I don't think so.

1375
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:44,640
How about this? I'm so happy.

1376
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:46,780


1377
02:24:50,130 --> 02:24:52,080
Is this enough?

1378
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:54,420
A little bit more.

1379
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:55,790
What?

1380
02:24:56,130 --> 02:24:57,130
It's not enough.

1381
02:24:57,770 --> 02:24:58,980
It's really not enough.

1382
02:25:00,050 --> 02:25:01,260
You are so cheeky.

1383
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,300
You are so cheeky.

1384
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:09,940
You are so cheeky.

1385
02:25:09,941 --> 02:25:10,981
You are happy, aren't you?

1386
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:14,720
You think it's not bad, don't you?

1387
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:17,000
Because three of us are doing this.

1388
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:20,160
You are not happy.

1389
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:23,040
What is this?

1390
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:25,200
I'm going to feed you.

1391
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,860
This is our food.

1392
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:31,020
Drink it.

1393
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:33,680
Drink it.

1394
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:38,060
It means you are happy.

1395
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:41,420
What is this?

1396
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:46,680
Stand up and show me.

1397
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:49,100
Show me.

1398
02:25:49,101 --> 02:25:50,101
Let's take a look.

1399
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:54,620
What's going on, Chinta?

1400
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,080
What's going on with your pants?

1401
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:58,580
I've seen it a lot.

1402
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,660
Chinta, be quiet.

1403
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,560
I'll show you.

1404
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:10,500
Chinta's Chinta.

1405
02:26:13,530 --> 02:26:16,500
Komichinda.

1406
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:20,800
It's gross!

1407
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:23,400
Isn't it big? It's true.

1408
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,360


1409
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,720
It's bigger than a tent.

1410
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:33,060
It's a good tent for a tent.

1411
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:35,440
You're getting carried away.

1412
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:38,020
You're getting carried away.

1413
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:42,140
If you do that, it will
stick to your mouth.

1414
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:45,120
It looks smelly.

1415
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,360
You are lucky.

1416
02:26:54,660 --> 02:26:55,780
You are happy, aren't
you? You are happy.

1417
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:58,820


1418
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:01,740
Do you want me to
hold it? Yes, please.

1419
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:03,640
Here we go.

1420
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,620


1421
02:27:11,695 --> 02:27:12,695
It's moving a lot.

1422
02:27:14,090 --> 02:27:15,100
Here we go.

1423
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:17,480
It looks good.

1424
02:27:17,481 --> 02:27:19,020
It's perfect!

1425
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:23,400
I'll take a picture for you.

1426
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:26,780
Can you open it? Here we go.

1427
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:32,360
It looks good.

1428
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:37,180


1429
02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:40,140
I'm happy to take a picture with you.

1430
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,880
I'm happy, too.

1431
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:50,070
I think it's a good idea
to separate the legs.

1432
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:54,860
Wow, it's a nice color.

1433
02:27:57,310 --> 02:27:59,080
It's getting bigger and bigger.

1434
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:01,480
It's amazing.

1435
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:04,100
There's no choice but to take it back.

1436
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:08,940
It feels good.

1437
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:11,740
Doesn't it feel good?

1438
02:28:11,741 --> 02:28:12,901
Thank you for your hard work.

1439
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:15,100
Oh, my God.

1440
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:17,460
I can't believe it.

1441
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:19,700
How do you feel? I feel good.

1442
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,441
You feel good, don't you?

1443
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:24,800
You feel good, don't you?

1444
02:28:24,801 --> 02:28:26,220
It's harder than before.

1445
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:31,860
I can't stand it.

1446
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:37,180
I can't stand it.

1447
02:28:37,181 --> 02:28:40,060
I can't stand it.

1448
02:28:40,061 --> 02:28:40,600
I can't stand it.

1449
02:28:40,601 --> 02:28:40,680
I can't stand it.

1450
02:28:40,681 --> 02:28:40,880
I can't stand it.

1451
02:28:40,881 --> 02:28:42,161
I'm worried about you, aren't I?

1452
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:44,120
Please do something for me.

1453
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:45,440
Really?

1454
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:46,780
Please don't do that.

1455
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:48,800
I'm so sad.

1456
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:52,000
I'm so angry.

1457
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:55,160
I can't do that.

1458
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:03,160
Oh, my God.

1459
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:05,800
What's this? It's amazing.

1460
02:29:05,801 --> 02:29:06,801
Wow! It's so dark.

1461
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:09,120


1462
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:12,140
Do you want to sit
down? Let's sit down.

1463
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:13,500


1464
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:15,920
We're kind, so we'll give you a chair.

1465
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:20,120
It's fun to sit on the chair.

1466
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:22,080
It's fun, though.

1467
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:25,110
Look.

1468
02:29:27,580 --> 02:29:28,580
It's great.

1469
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:30,120
It's a good view.

1470
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:32,920
Please sit down.

1471
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:34,980
What's this? It's so wet.

1472
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:36,700


1473
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:38,560
The tip is shiny.

1474
02:29:40,270 --> 02:29:41,460
It smells, doesn't
it? Yes, it does.

1475
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:44,221
It smells so much.

1476
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:45,500
It does, doesn't it?

1477
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:47,340
Are you washing it properly?

1478
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:48,380
Yes.

1479
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,960
I'll clean it for you.

1480
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:51,940
You're so kind.

1481
02:29:51,941 --> 02:29:52,941
You're so kind.

1482
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:55,700
It's so shiny.

1483
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:56,520
It's so shiny.

1484
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:57,800
It doesn't matter which one.

1485
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:04,140
It's clean now.

1486
02:30:05,145 --> 02:30:06,520
Why did you make
it clean? Me too.

1487
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:09,180


1488
02:30:12,275 --> 02:30:14,300
Let's do it in order.

1489
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:16,340
OK.

1490
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:25,380
What is this?

1491
02:30:27,240 --> 02:30:29,480
It's a special one.

1492
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:33,960
We don't do this with that much money.

1493
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:38,060
Bring more next time.

1494
02:30:42,225 --> 02:30:45,420
Who do you like? Tell me later.

1495
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:47,400
Let's wait for your answer.

1496
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:53,640
Who do you like? Tell me.

1497
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:55,260
Make up your mind.

1498
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:03,000
Wow, your tongue is so soft.

1499
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:04,820
You look so good.

1500
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,460
How do you feel? I feel good.

1501
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:08,000


1502
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:09,180
Then say it more.

1503
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:12,560
It's hard to understand.

1504
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,800
Thanks to you two, it's so beautiful.

1505
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:19,420
Right?

1506
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:20,780
I'm so grateful.

1507
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,220
But I don't know if it stinks.

1508
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:26,640
You should wash your face.

1509
02:31:26,641 --> 02:31:28,041
Are you washing your face properly?

1510
02:31:28,340 --> 02:31:29,740
Are you washing your face properly?

1511
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:31,460
I'm not washing my face.

1512
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,620
Who was the most comfortable?

1513
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:38,940
Who was the most comfortable?

1514
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:41,060
Who was it?

1515
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:43,720
Tell me clearly.

1516
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,980
Tell me clearly.

1517
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:49,640
Who was the most comfortable?

1518
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:56,560
Who was it?

1519
02:31:58,400 --> 02:31:59,780
How do you feel?

1520
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:03,540
It's hot? I can't decide.

1521
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:05,920


1522
02:32:06,940 --> 02:32:10,180
I don't feel anything.

1523
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:11,600
It's like the one in Jumanko.

1524
02:32:17,300 --> 02:32:18,760
How do you feel?

1525
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:21,640
It's meaningless if you just feel good.

1526
02:32:22,545 --> 02:32:23,620
Yes.

1527
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:29,040
You three don't have to lick me.

1528
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:31,200
How do you feel? I can't decide.

1529
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,680


1530
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:41,560
You can't decide.

1531
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:43,340
What?

1532
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:44,380
You can't decide.

1533
02:32:45,580 --> 02:32:46,800
You can't decide.

1534
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:48,280
You have to decide.

1535
02:32:48,810 --> 02:32:49,810
I need to pee.

1536
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,280
I won't lick you anymore.

1537
02:32:53,360 --> 02:32:54,340
Don't lick me.

1538
02:32:54,341 --> 02:32:59,800
Come on, let's go to bed.

1539
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,100
Come on, go to bed.

1540
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:13,380
OK! It's time to get up.

1541
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:14,740
It's time to get up.

1542
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:27,160
The day I made a baby
food, I went to the candy shop.

1543
02:33:27,161 --> 02:33:27,740
I made the candy with a lot of effort.

1544
02:33:27,741 --> 02:33:32,100
I was a little embarrassed about
making candy with a lot of effort.

1545
02:33:32,101 --> 02:33:34,781
I was a little embarrassed about
making candy with a lot of effort.

1546
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:58,500
Choco is an adult cat
who doesn't know that.

1547
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:06,780
For Choco, it is the greatest
pleasure to touch the floor.

1548
02:34:06,781 --> 02:34:07,920
Look at this.

1549
02:34:09,380 --> 02:34:10,980
Chinta, it looks good on you.

1550
02:34:11,980 --> 02:34:13,720
It looks good on me, doesn't it?

1551
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:17,760
Isn't it cute? It's perfect.

1552
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:19,440


1553
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:20,620
Let's make it beautiful.

1554
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:25,420
Isn't it great to stand
like this? It's great.

1555
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:27,940


1556
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:29,960
What's this?

1557
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:31,300
Isn't it great?

1558
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:34,040
Yuka, look at Jintan.

1559
02:34:34,610 --> 02:34:35,730
He is playing with my manko.

1560
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:38,010
He is so luxurious.

1561
02:34:39,645 --> 02:34:41,440
Jintan, Jintan, you are so big.

1562
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:46,040
Jintan, you are so big.

1563
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:47,560
Jintan, you are so big.

1564
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:50,000
Jintan, you are so chubby.

1565
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:54,920
Hey, you two.

1566
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:57,580
Can I?

1567
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,160
Jintan, look over there.

1568
02:34:59,161 --> 02:35:01,580
Keep an eye on them.

1569
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:03,200
Hurry up.

1570
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:07,140
Is it just us? Maybe.

1571
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,160
We are here.

1572
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:11,420
We are here.

1573
02:35:12,040 --> 02:35:13,040


1574
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:21,060
Let's do it in a special way.

1575
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:24,380
I like it.

1576
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:24,900
Did you bring a needle?

1577
02:35:24,901 --> 02:35:26,021
What did you bring with you?

1578
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:27,360
Oh, you didn't let me go.

1579
02:35:28,140 --> 02:35:30,160
It's okay if you don't bring one.

1580
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:31,520
I'm sure you'll bring one.

1581
02:35:31,610 --> 02:35:32,610
Let's do it.

1582
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:34,320
Let's do it.

1583
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:36,040
Oh, it's like GD.

1584
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:37,800
Who do you want to call first?

1585
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:39,020
Do you want to go first?

1586
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:39,440
Is it okay? It's okay.

1587
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:40,360


1588
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:41,640
Really?

1589
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:43,080
Can I go first? Yes, you can.

1590
02:35:43,081 --> 02:35:43,760


1591
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:44,940
Really?

1592
02:35:47,420 --> 02:35:50,960
I think Chinta is pretty good.

1593
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:52,780
Really?

1594
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:53,460
Yes.

1595
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:56,140
I'll put it in for you.

1596
02:35:56,141 --> 02:35:57,300
Are you happy? Thank you.

1597
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:00,340


1598
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:03,040
Are you scared?

1599
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:07,660
What do you think?

1600
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:09,500
You can do it if you want.

1601
02:36:10,700 --> 02:36:14,720
Don't do it if you don't want to.

1602
02:36:14,940 --> 02:36:19,120
Look carefully.

1603
02:36:19,121 --> 02:36:20,121
Look at this.

1604
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:23,260
I'm not wearing anything.

1605
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:25,400
I'm bare-skinned.

1606
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:27,320
Is it OK?

1607
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:29,200
Yes.

1608
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:29,920
Is it OK?

1609
02:36:30,220 --> 02:36:30,720
Yes.

1610
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:31,080
Yes.

1611
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:32,680
I did it.

1612
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:36,320
You did it.

1613
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:42,500
Chinta, be happy.

1614
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:43,740
We're studying.

1615
02:36:43,741 --> 02:36:49,720
It's the first time for you, isn't it?

1616
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,020
It's the first time for me, too.

1617
02:36:51,021 --> 02:36:52,021
Oh, no!

1618
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,800
You are almost like a virgin.

1619
02:36:57,440 --> 02:36:58,820
You should be kind to a virgin.

1620
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:00,800
Yes.

1621
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,820
You have a big neck.

1622
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:07,760
Have you ever been hit?

1623
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:09,320
No.

1624
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:16,040
I'm going to make ramen.

1625
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:19,020
We haven't put it yet.

1626
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:34,480
We haven't put it yet.

1627
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:41,400
Which one do you
like? I don't mind.

1628
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:42,700


1629
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:44,080
Really?

1630
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:45,780
Ichi-piko is kind.

1631
02:37:45,930 --> 02:37:46,930
Ichi-piko is kind.

1632
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:48,500
Then, I'll put it in.

1633
02:37:50,055 --> 02:37:51,060
Gyaru-chan is also kind.

1634
02:37:52,590 --> 02:37:53,750
Ichi-piko is a very good one.

1635
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:55,480
Ichi-piko is a very good one.

1636
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:56,900
Of course.

1637
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:02,640
Isn't it big?

1638
02:38:03,590 --> 02:38:04,660
It was a little dangerous.

1639
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:06,280
What about the hardness?

1640
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:07,980
It was very dangerous.

1641
02:38:08,570 --> 02:38:09,900
I want to put it in soon.

1642
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:13,280
It's a little strong, but it's really good.

1643
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:18,580
You like boobs.

1644
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:21,300
I'll show you my boobs.

1645
02:38:28,180 --> 02:38:32,780
Do you want this?

1646
02:38:34,205 --> 02:38:40,920
This is the first time I've ever
seen a baby eating a baby's food.

1647
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:43,691
I was surprised to see a
baby eating a baby's food.

1648
02:38:43,715 --> 02:38:46,040
I was surprised to see a
baby eating a baby's food.

1649
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:51,600
I was surprised to see a
baby eating a baby's food.

1650
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:56,140
I was surprised to see a
baby eating a baby's food.

1651
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:03,780
I'm going to take a bath.

1652
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:05,020
Yeah! That's all.

1653
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:07,740
Oh! Don't stop.

1654
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:09,840
It's dangerous.

1655
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:11,940


1656
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,720


1657
02:39:14,765 --> 02:39:16,400
Isn't it dangerous?

1658
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:17,840
I'm not going yet.

1659
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:20,260
What did you say?

1660
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:22,260
I can't take a bath.

1661
02:39:23,050 --> 02:39:24,160
I can't take a bath.

1662
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:25,400
I can't take a bath.

1663
02:39:26,980 --> 02:39:28,220
Bye-bye.

1664
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:29,560
I'm going to take a bath.

1665
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:31,620
You are such a good girl.

1666
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:41,990
You are such a good girl.

1667
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:43,350
I want to go.

1668
02:39:43,770 --> 02:39:44,890
You want to go?

1669
02:39:44,891 --> 02:39:45,190
You want to go?

1670
02:39:45,710 --> 02:39:46,710
You can't go yet.

1671
02:39:47,950 --> 02:39:49,270
We are not looking forward to it.

1672
02:39:49,570 --> 02:39:50,570
That's right.

1673
02:39:50,890 --> 02:39:52,350
We don't know anything at all.

1674
02:39:52,351 --> 02:39:57,530
I don't want you to do
it, but you have to do it.

1675
02:39:57,531 --> 02:39:58,850
You have to do it.

1676
02:39:59,075 --> 02:40:01,290
I don't want you to do it from behind.

1677
02:40:01,980 --> 02:40:02,980
I want you to do it.

1678
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:04,110
Who will do it first?

1679
02:40:04,390 --> 02:40:04,910
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1680
02:40:05,370 --> 02:40:05,450
OK.

1681
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:06,990
Rock-paper-scissors.

1682
02:40:08,290 --> 02:40:10,350
I'm strong today.

1683
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:11,210
You are strong.

1684
02:40:11,550 --> 02:40:12,550
I'm lucky.

1685
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,320
I'll buy you bubble tea later.

1686
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:15,430
OK.

1687
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,770
Thank you.

1688
02:40:18,970 --> 02:40:20,470
What should I do?

1689
02:40:22,890 --> 02:40:24,350
Your panties are wet.

1690
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:43,040
I can see your underwear.

1691
02:40:44,710 --> 02:40:45,710
It's the best.

1692
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:46,880
You don't have to see it.

1693
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:50,540
Oh, my God.

1694
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:56,900
Hey, Chien-chan, shake
your hips more seriously.

1695
02:40:58,580 --> 02:40:59,580
Do your best.

1696
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:00,720
Do it more seriously.

1697
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:05,200
Oh, it feels good.

1698
02:41:08,330 --> 02:41:09,330
Oh, it's terrible.

1699
02:41:09,790 --> 02:41:10,950
Is it terrible? Oh, shit.

1700
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:13,130


1701
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:15,450
Oh, it's terrible.

1702
02:41:17,870 --> 02:41:21,330
Oh, it's painful.

1703
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:26,900
A little.

1704
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:33,940
I thought I was the one who ate it, but
I didn't know I was the one who ate it.

1705
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:35,440
It's all thanks to you.

1706
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:39,760
It's open.

1707
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:41,640
It's open, so let's go.

1708
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:44,600
Let's go.

1709
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:46,680
Let's eat.

1710
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:48,700
First of all, the bag is dangerous.

1711
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:49,080
It's open.

1712
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:50,740
Let's eat.

1713
02:41:51,980 --> 02:41:52,980
Let's eat.

1714
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:56,260
Let's eat.

1715
02:41:56,261 --> 02:41:57,520
It's delicious.

1716
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:58,660
It's delicious.

1717
02:42:00,100 --> 02:42:01,100
Isn't it great? It's so good.

1718
02:42:01,460 --> 02:42:02,680
It's so good.

1719
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:09,180
It's like a tank.

1720
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:14,960
I'm going to make you a bigger one.

1721
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:17,360
I'm going to make you a bigger one.

1722
02:42:17,361 --> 02:42:18,540
Go for it.

1723
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:22,140
It's so good.

1724
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:23,740
Look at this.

1725
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,840
It's so good.

1726
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:27,540
It feels good.

1727
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:30,340
Chinta, it's great.

1728
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:35,520
Chinta, it's great.

1729
02:42:35,521 --> 02:42:36,521
Move your waist.

1730
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:40,440
Chinta, it feels good.

1731
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:45,240
Chinta, it's great.

1732
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:47,800
It feels good.

1733
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:50,520
Move your waist.

1734
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:52,620
It's great.

1735
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:00,400
Chinta, you are awesome!

1736
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:01,780
I know, right?

1737
02:43:02,420 --> 02:43:03,420
Chinta, you are awesome!

1738
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:05,300
That's it! That's it!

1739
02:43:05,301 --> 02:43:06,301
It feels so good!

1740
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:07,580
Please do it!

1741
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:08,220
It's intense!

1742
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:09,180
Awesome!

1743
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:10,480
It feels so good!

1744
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:12,800
Chinta, you are awesome!

1745
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:16,260
Awesome! Awesome!

1746
02:43:16,380 --> 02:43:17,800
Let's go! Let's go!

1747
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:18,940
Let's go! Let's go!

1748
02:43:18,941 --> 02:43:23,280
Oh, it's so good.

1749
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:25,120
It feels so good.

1750
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:27,120
Hey.

1751
02:43:28,430 --> 02:43:29,540
It's mine.

1752
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:31,000
You don't have to say that.

1753
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:33,540
I said it's mine.

1754
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:35,220
It's mine.

1755
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:37,200
It's mine.

1756
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:42,100
It's mine.

1757
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:48,680
It's mine.

1758
02:43:48,681 --> 02:43:49,681
Thank you for the meal.

1759
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:51,840
What are you doing?

1760
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:55,160
I'm playing with the apple.

1761
02:43:56,680 --> 02:43:58,460
I'm happy.

1762
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:01,500
Oh, my God!

1763
02:44:01,820 --> 02:44:02,820
Oh, my God!

1764
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:05,200
It looks delicious.

1765
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:08,400
Oh, my God!

1766
02:44:08,580 --> 02:44:09,580
Oh, my God!

1767
02:44:09,581 --> 02:44:11,380
Oh, my God!

1768
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:13,180
Oh, my God!

1769
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:16,100
Oh, my God!

1770
02:44:16,101 --> 02:44:17,720
They are so focused on the food.

1771
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:19,140
It's too big.

1772
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:21,040
It's so big.

1773
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:23,160
It's so good.

1774
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:25,100
I want to eat it so much.

1775
02:44:26,255 --> 02:44:28,320
It's so good.

1776
02:44:28,750 --> 02:44:30,190
You are going to eat it, aren't you?

1777
02:44:32,820 --> 02:44:33,820
I want to eat it.

1778
02:44:37,540 --> 02:44:38,540
I want to eat it.

1779
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:43,040
I want to eat it.

1780
02:44:43,580 --> 02:44:44,580
I want to eat it.

1781
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:45,520
I want to eat it.

1782
02:44:45,521 --> 02:44:45,640
Are you ready? Yes, I am.

1783
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:47,340
Here we go.

1784
02:44:47,341 --> 02:44:48,341


1785
02:44:49,260 --> 02:44:49,920
Wow! Erotic! Oh, no.

1786
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:51,240


1787
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:52,700


1788
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:55,680
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

1789
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:57,020
Oh, no.

1790
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:59,541
This is really gross.

1791
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:01,780
Oh, no.

1792
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:04,120
Oh, no.

1793
02:45:04,121 --> 02:45:04,480
Oh, no.

1794
02:45:04,481 --> 02:45:04,560
Oh, no.

1795
02:45:04,561 --> 02:45:04,580
Oh, no.

1796
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:06,400
Oh, no.

1797
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:07,800
Oh, no.

1798
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:11,720
Oh, no.

1799
02:45:11,721 --> 02:45:12,780
You can't read it.

1800
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:20,060
You're still in a dilemma.

1801
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:25,120
I'll take it.

1802
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:27,560
I'll take it again.

1803
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:32,100
It's awesome.

1804
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:58,940
I'll take it, too.

1805
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:06,540
Next, Rima.

1806
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:08,900
Look, Chintan is wearing her eyewear.

1807
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:11,640
Isn't it great? It's great.

1808
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:13,320
Oh, no.

1809
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:15,660
I want it.

1810
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:18,400


1811
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:20,160
Is it okay to be so
aggressive? I can bear it.

1812
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:24,620


1813
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:27,700
Can you?
You've been bearing it for a while.

1814
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:30,720
I can't.

1815
02:46:30,721 --> 02:46:33,560
But, the more you put up with
it, the more popular you will be.

1816
02:46:36,150 --> 02:46:37,190
It's better to be popular.

1817
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:39,460
You want to be popular, don't you?

1818
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:40,500
I'm not popular.

1819
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:42,220
Wait, Chinko!

1820
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:44,840
You want to be popular, don't you?

1821
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:49,060
You want to be popular, don't you?

1822
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:53,680
Did she really say that?

1823
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:55,220
Oh, no! She's serious.

1824
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:56,440


1825
02:46:56,940 --> 02:46:58,900
Chinko, how many times did you get angry?

1826
02:47:01,095 --> 02:47:02,760
Oh my god!

1827
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:03,880
Is this a pre-sale?

1828
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:05,160
It's a pre-sale.

1829
02:47:06,460 --> 02:47:08,040
Is this a half-ready?

1830
02:47:09,535 --> 02:47:10,740
This is awesome!

1831
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:12,600
Isn't it?

1832
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:13,700
Wow!

1833
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:14,760
This is awesome!

1834
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:16,440
Isn't it?

1835
02:47:16,441 --> 02:47:17,441
This is awesome!

1836
02:47:19,350 --> 02:47:20,620
How much do you eat?

1837
02:47:26,490 --> 02:47:27,660
It stinks! It's so smelly.

1838
02:47:27,661 --> 02:47:28,661
Move.

1839
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:30,920
Come here.

1840
02:47:31,620 --> 02:47:32,860
It's so spicy.

1841
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:36,580


1842
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:39,140
Eat it with spicy sauce.

1843
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:44,780
It's so big.

1844
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:46,820
What?

1845
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:48,420
You still want to eat a box of lunch?

1846
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:51,100
You have a big mouth.

1847
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:52,980
You have a big mouth.

1848
02:47:54,220 --> 02:47:55,300
What? I'm Marumie.

1849
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:59,590


1850
02:48:00,650 --> 02:48:01,650
I'm embarrassed.

1851
02:48:02,470 --> 02:48:05,950
I'm Marumie.

1852
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:27,120
You're sleeping a lot again.

1853
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:31,340
You're sleeping a lot.

1854
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,660
You're sleeping a lot.

1855
02:48:35,140 --> 02:48:36,500
I'll give you more.

1856
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:38,100
Thank you.

1857
02:48:39,220 --> 02:48:44,260
You're so kind.

1858
02:48:45,140 --> 02:48:47,100
You're too kind.

1859
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:49,200
I'll do it for you.

1860
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:55,020
You can do it, right?

1861
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:57,180
I can't do it yet.

1862
02:48:58,260 --> 02:48:59,380
You have to do it.

1863
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:02,320
You can do it.

1864
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:05,300
You can do it.

1865
02:49:05,301 --> 02:49:06,301
I'm not here.

1866
02:49:07,900 --> 02:49:08,900
I'm here.

1867
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:14,140
I feel good.

1868
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:15,600
I'm sleepy.

1869
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:19,260
I'm here.

1870
02:49:20,060 --> 02:49:22,360
I'm here.

1871
02:49:24,140 --> 02:49:27,321
Our shop is... Please show me.

1872
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:30,300
I'm here.

1873
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:32,780
I'm here.

1874
02:49:33,220 --> 02:49:36,040
I'm here.

1875
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:38,260
I'm here.

1876
02:49:38,261 --> 02:49:42,980
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm starting to miss you.

1877
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:47,660
Pitta, lend me your hand.

1878
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:51,260
I want you to lend me your hand, too.

1879
02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:56,980
You'll be back soon,
right? You're so cute.

1880
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:01,320
You're so cute.

1881
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:05,340


1882
02:50:08,260 --> 02:50:09,620
We can go out now.

1883
02:50:09,621 --> 02:50:10,621
Yes, we can.

1884
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:14,680
Then, let's go together.

1885
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:18,320
Let's go together.

1886
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:19,600
I'm so happy.

1887
02:50:48,250 --> 02:50:49,650
It's coming out.

1888
02:50:53,310 --> 02:50:54,670
It's amazing.

1889
02:50:56,370 --> 02:50:57,570
How many times did you go out?

1890
02:50:58,480 --> 02:50:59,290
Three times? That's amazing.

1891
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:00,850
Wow, it's amazing.

1892
02:51:00,851 --> 02:51:02,230
RU-chan, isn't it?

1893
02:51:02,231 --> 02:51:02,550
Isn't it great?

1894
02:51:03,250 --> 02:51:04,250
Isn't it great?

1895
02:51:04,290 --> 02:51:05,370
We are going to be friends.

1896
02:51:06,070 --> 02:51:07,710
Oh, let's do it together.

1897
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:09,670
We are going to be friends from today.

1898
02:51:10,610 --> 02:51:13,110
Let's take a picture together.

1899
02:51:15,030 --> 02:51:16,230
Let's take a picture together.

1900
02:51:16,650 --> 02:51:16,970
What? Come here.

1901
02:51:17,570 --> 02:51:18,570


1902
02:51:21,290 --> 02:51:22,290
Are you ready?

1903
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:25,270
Yes.

1904
02:51:25,730 --> 02:51:26,430
Okay.

1905
02:51:26,590 --> 02:51:27,590
Cheese!

1906
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:31,690
That's a good one.

1907
02:51:33,510 --> 02:51:34,550
Let's listen to this song.

1908
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:37,990
Let's listen to the next song.

1909
02:52:19,580 --> 02:52:41,220
There are a lot of children.

1910
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,320
It's exciting.

1911
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:46,240
It's amazing.

1912
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:47,580
Are you shooting a movie?

1913
02:52:49,690 --> 02:52:50,320
Are you shooting a movie?

1914
02:52:50,321 --> 02:52:50,360
Is it the future?

1915
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:52,280
No, it's the future.

1916
02:52:53,540 --> 02:52:54,540
Is it the future?

1917
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:56,540
It's the future, isn't it?

1918
02:52:57,440 --> 02:52:58,440
I don't know English.

1919
02:52:58,860 --> 02:53:00,140
I don't know words.

1920
02:53:00,380 --> 02:53:01,380
I'm an alien.

1921
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:08,690
I like you, my friend.

1922
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:11,450
What?

1923
02:53:11,550 --> 02:53:12,550
Did you say you like me?

1924
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:14,250
Do you like me?

1925
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:15,990
Isn't it crazy that you like me?

1926
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:20,190
Because I'm a robot.

1927
02:53:20,840 --> 02:53:22,910
That's right. Androids are made by AI.

1928
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:26,280
But we can understand their charm.

1929
02:53:27,270 --> 02:53:28,270
That's great.

1930
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:30,950
Well, shall we go?

1931
02:53:33,890 --> 02:53:35,110
Brother, come here.

1932
02:53:35,690 --> 02:53:36,690
It's fun here.

1933
02:53:37,210 --> 02:53:38,610
What? Is it fun?

1934
02:53:58,270 --> 02:53:59,680
Hey, look this way.

1935
02:54:07,565 --> 02:54:10,560
It's been a while since I had
a meal, but I'm still nervous.

1936
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:13,180
My nipples are swollen.

1937
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:17,700
My nipples are delicious.

1938
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:20,820
I've been nervous since I was born.

1939
02:54:23,100 --> 02:54:24,520
I'm hungry.

1940
02:54:25,910 --> 02:54:26,910
Really? I'm so happy.

1941
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:32,600
It's delicious.

1942
02:54:32,601 --> 02:54:35,100
I'm going to eat it all.

1943
02:54:49,795 --> 02:54:51,280
Is it delicious?

1944
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:55,180
Let me eat it, too.

1945
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:07,275
But there is no

1946
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:41,540
Sadako, you feel good, don't you?

1947
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:44,060
You know Sadako, don't you?

1948
02:55:44,620 --> 02:55:45,840
That's my girl!

1949
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:49,740
I'm number 2, not number 1.

1950
02:55:50,440 --> 02:55:52,180
I'm number 3, not number 2.

1951
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:53,460
I'm number 3, not number 2.

1952
02:55:53,461 --> 02:55:55,140
You're like a human.

1953
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:01,320
Hmm?

1954
02:56:02,060 --> 02:56:02,920
Hmm?

1955
02:56:02,921 --> 02:56:03,200
Hmm?

1956
02:56:03,420 --> 02:56:03,860
Hmm?

1957
02:56:03,861 --> 02:56:04,000
Hmm?

1958
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:05,140
Hmm?

1959
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:06,720
Hmm?

1960
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:11,440
Hmm?

1961
02:56:12,910 --> 02:56:13,910
Hmm?

1962
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Hmm?

1963
02:56:19,835 --> 02:56:20,835
Hmm?

1964
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:21,800
Hmm?

1965
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:24,940
Hurry up and program it in your head.

1966
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:32,420
Did you get the feeling of the future?

1967
02:56:34,520 --> 02:56:36,820
Then I'll teach you how to feel better.

1968
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:39,940
Do you know how to feel better?

1969
02:56:42,710 --> 02:56:43,900
Do you know how to attack?

1970
02:56:45,460 --> 02:56:46,520
What did you
study? Oh, it's hot.

1971
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:52,800


1972
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:03,580
I want to touch it directly.

1973
02:57:05,190 --> 02:57:06,380
What is this place
called? I don't know.

1974
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:09,200


1975
02:57:10,480 --> 02:57:11,480
It's called Manko.

1976
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:14,110
Manko, Manko.

1977
02:57:15,690 --> 02:57:17,100
You seem to be interested in Manko.

1978
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:54,940
Manko, water is coming out.

1979
02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:06,120
My manko is coming out, too.

1980
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:07,640
Water is coming out.

1981
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:08,480
Water is coming out.

1982
02:58:08,481 --> 02:58:09,481
I'm sorry.

1983
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:10,940
I'm sorry.

1984
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:14,360
I'm sorry.

1985
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:16,760
I'm sorry.

1986
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:33,590
I have to make this
level of the composition.

1987
02:58:35,250 --> 02:58:36,570
Please watch it carefully.

1988
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:00,400
Do you want to have more fun?

1989
02:59:01,100 --> 02:59:02,380
Please sleep a little.

1990
02:59:07,940 --> 02:59:08,940
What? Manko.

1991
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,300
Manko.

1992
02:59:10,940 --> 02:59:11,940


1993
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:14,070
Ah.

1994
02:59:14,690 --> 02:59:15,690
Ah.

1995
02:59:25,010 --> 02:59:26,010
Ah.

1996
02:59:26,850 --> 02:59:27,850
Ah.

1997
02:59:27,910 --> 02:59:28,910
Ah.

1998
02:59:30,980 --> 02:59:31,240
Ah.

1999
02:59:31,241 --> 02:59:31,520
Ah.

2000
02:59:31,521 --> 02:59:32,420
Ah.

2001
02:59:32,421 --> 02:59:32,820
Ah.

2002
02:59:33,030 --> 02:59:33,720
Ah.

2003
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:34,560
Ah.

2004
02:59:34,800 --> 02:59:35,800
Ah.

2005
02:59:41,660 --> 02:59:42,660
Ah.

2006
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:43,700
Ah.

2007
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:44,040
Ah.

2008
02:59:44,041 --> 02:59:45,041
Ah.

2009
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:58,920
Ah.

2010
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:00,160
Ah.

2011
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:06,540
Ah.

2012
03:00:06,590 --> 03:00:08,540
I want to put it in too.

2013
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:09,640
Oh, my.

2014
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:14,360
It feels so good.

2015
03:00:14,580 --> 03:00:15,580
I'm going to put it in.

2016
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:18,440
I'm going to put it in.

2017
03:00:21,020 --> 03:00:22,560
Oh, I put it in.

2018
03:00:25,130 --> 03:00:26,400
Does it feel good?

2019
03:00:32,970 --> 03:00:34,540
Oh, it feels good.

2020
03:00:58,010 --> 03:01:27,930
She sofa laughs like a
kid and she is a good girl.

2021
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:40,310
She talks about winter camp.

2022
03:02:11,130 --> 03:02:12,160
She talks about love water.

2023
03:02:12,161 --> 03:02:13,720
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

2024
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:16,560
Water, water.

2025
03:02:16,740 --> 03:02:18,140
You're drinking water, aren't you?

2026
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:22,540
Next, put in a new one.

2027
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:23,900
Put in a new one.

2028
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:25,720
Water, water.

2029
03:02:26,510 --> 03:02:27,870
You're drinking water, aren't you?

2030
03:02:28,190 --> 03:02:29,270
Do you like drinking water?

2031
03:02:34,850 --> 03:02:36,500
Let's drink a lot of water.

2032
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:43,920
Oh, it's cold.

2033
03:02:44,240 --> 03:02:45,240
What?

2034
03:02:45,880 --> 03:02:46,880
It's raining a lot.

2035
03:02:47,020 --> 03:02:48,180
Let's take a look at the sky.

2036
03:02:51,090 --> 03:02:53,940
It's slippery and not
going well than before.

2037
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:55,540
Yes.

2038
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:56,680
It happens.

2039
03:02:57,760 --> 03:02:58,760
It's amazing.

2040
03:02:58,800 --> 03:02:59,980
Who is working hard?

2041
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:02,260
Can you hear the sound of water?

2042
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:03,740
Can you hear it? It's coming.

2043
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:05,080
It's coming.

2044
03:03:05,980 --> 03:03:06,300
It's coming.

2045
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:07,300
It's coming.

2046
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:09,121
I can't believe it! Sit down.

2047
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:25,300


2048
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:27,640
I'll show you the body of a future woman.

2049
03:03:39,970 --> 03:03:41,650
You ate it from the spoon.

2050
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:46,220
You ate it.

2051
03:03:46,780 --> 03:03:48,400
It feels good.

2052
03:03:50,970 --> 03:03:58,780
Can I sleep? Yes, you can.

2053
03:03:59,760 --> 03:04:00,760


2054
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:08,380
Kima-chan, you are so cute.

2055
03:04:16,770 --> 03:04:19,660
Kima-chan, you move your
tail without my permission.

2056
03:04:42,340 --> 03:04:45,900
You are so cute that I want to hug you.

2057
03:04:47,740 --> 03:04:48,740
Wait a minute.

2058
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:53,420
I'm sorry. Please let me hold you.

2059
03:04:54,700 --> 03:04:55,800
No, I don't.

2060
03:04:55,801 --> 03:04:56,960
I'm glad to meet you.

2061
03:04:58,000 --> 03:04:59,340
Do you feel good?

2062
03:05:00,580 --> 03:05:02,360
I don't feel good.

2063
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:04,080
What do you mean?

2064
03:05:05,080 --> 03:05:07,540
I feel like I'm getting
wrinkles on my face.

2065
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:12,700
If you don't feel good, I'll
give you a piggyback ride.

2066
03:05:27,290 --> 03:05:28,730
I can't stop my waist.

2067
03:05:29,950 --> 03:05:33,470
Let's go.

2068
03:05:34,470 --> 03:05:35,470
Wait.

2069
03:05:35,670 --> 03:05:36,670
Let's go.

2070
03:05:37,630 --> 03:05:42,510
It's new.

2071
03:05:54,700 --> 03:05:55,700
What? It's white.

2072
03:05:59,870 --> 03:06:02,880


2073
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:06,660
It smells like a human.

2074
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:19,260
You are amazing.

2075
03:06:21,050 --> 03:06:22,780
Give me some ramen.

2076
03:06:23,620 --> 03:06:24,620
Give me.

2077
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:28,520
It's me, Moyu.

2078
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,220
Hey, you still have a lot of pimples.

2079
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:34,960
I don't know what to do with it.

2080
03:06:35,400 --> 03:06:37,460
Oh, it's open.

2081
03:06:38,140 --> 03:06:39,660
It feels good.

2082
03:06:40,170 --> 03:06:41,440
Hey, this hand is open.

2083
03:06:42,060 --> 03:06:43,060
Hold my hand.

2084
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:46,460
Hey, you have a lot of pimples.

2085
03:06:46,660 --> 03:06:47,900
It feels good.

2086
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:50,000
Hey, you feel good, too.

2087
03:06:50,200 --> 03:06:51,600
Oh, more, more.

2088
03:06:52,040 --> 03:06:53,040
Take me to the back.

2089
03:06:53,220 --> 03:06:54,240
Oh, that's right.

2090
03:06:56,800 --> 03:06:58,320
It's about to come!

2091
03:06:58,321 --> 03:06:59,380
It feels so good!

2092
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:01,620
It's coming!

2093
03:07:03,940 --> 03:07:05,460
It's almost!

2094
03:07:05,780 --> 03:07:07,420
It's coming!

2095
03:07:11,820 --> 03:07:12,820
It's coming!

2096
03:07:13,820 --> 03:07:14,320
It's coming!

2097
03:07:14,540 --> 03:08:01,790
It's coming!

2098
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:16,960
I gave you a wonderful moustache, so you'll
give me a stomach massage, won't you?

2099
03:08:19,080 --> 03:08:20,820
I'll give you a stomach massage.

2100
03:08:22,200 --> 03:08:23,200
What are you going to do?

2101
03:08:25,490 --> 03:08:30,120
I'll give you a stomach massage.

2102
03:08:30,670 --> 03:08:31,840
I'm in pain, too.

2103
03:08:31,990 --> 03:08:33,300
How about you, Nishi?

2104
03:08:35,280 --> 03:08:37,500
I'm in pain, too.

2105
03:08:38,200 --> 03:08:41,040
Tell me how it is.

2106
03:08:41,041 --> 03:08:42,041
It's coming!

2107
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:46,120
Yes, it came out.

2108
03:08:47,610 --> 03:08:49,200
It's coming…

2109
03:08:50,750 --> 03:08:53,110
It's still shocking, even
though it's only the second time.

2110
03:09:04,470 --> 03:09:05,916
This is the first time I've ever seen a cat
like this, and I'm very happy to see it.

2111
03:09:05,940 --> 03:09:09,470
It's a white cat, but it's
a very cute white cat.

2112
03:09:09,720 --> 03:09:18,187
I don't want to give it
to you, but I want you

2113
03:09:18,199 --> 03:09:26,310
to touch it so that it
will stand for a day.

2114
03:09:28,070 --> 03:09:31,330
Give me more.

2115
03:10:04,770 --> 03:10:16,090
It's the best, isn't it?
Let's do it more, Reika.

2116
03:10:17,260 --> 03:10:19,550
It's the best, isn't
it? Do it again.

2117
03:10:19,551 --> 03:10:20,551


2118
03:10:21,110 --> 03:10:22,290
It's the best, isn't it?

2119
03:10:24,530 --> 03:10:25,850
It's the best, isn't it?

2120
03:10:26,270 --> 03:10:26,890
Let's do it more.

2121
03:10:26,891 --> 03:10:27,891
Let's take a break.

2122
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:34,460
Oh, Koi-chan.

2123
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:45,900
Oh, that's good.

2124
03:10:49,120 --> 03:11:14,320
Hey, guys.

2125
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:18,160
The last big fight is about to start.

2126
03:11:19,940 --> 03:11:21,340
Let's go. Hurry up.

2127
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:22,460
Why? Look.

2128
03:11:23,060 --> 03:11:23,260


2129
03:11:23,840 --> 03:11:24,080
What?

2130
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:25,940
I'm waiting for you.

2131
03:11:25,941 --> 03:11:27,360
I can't run.

2132
03:11:27,361 --> 03:11:29,480
We only listen to what you say.

2133
03:11:39,320 --> 03:11:40,320
Excuse me.

2134
03:13:46,890 --> 03:13:49,330
There is a strange person.

2135
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:57,020
There is a strange person.

2136
03:14:00,170 --> 03:14:01,170
Can I lick you?

2137
03:14:08,260 --> 03:14:10,970
I will lick you with my soft hand.

2138
03:14:27,640 --> 03:14:30,720
It's been a long time since I've had a
bath, so I'm going to take a bath now.

2139
03:14:35,080 --> 03:14:35,640
I'm going to take a bath now.

2140
03:14:35,641 --> 03:14:37,920
Oh, it's hard.

2141
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:40,980
I'm good at taking a bath.

2142
03:14:56,240 --> 03:15:00,060
I'll give you a bath,
so take a video of me.

2143
03:15:00,460 --> 03:15:02,320
If you don't take a picture, I'll bite you.

2144
03:15:02,600 --> 03:15:03,700
I'll bite you.

2145
03:15:14,280 --> 03:15:16,700
Can I take a picture of you?

2146
03:15:17,060 --> 03:15:17,720
Yes.

2147
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:19,000
What are you doing?

2148
03:15:20,770 --> 03:15:22,240
I'm taking a picture of you.

2149
03:15:22,680 --> 03:15:23,800
I'm taking a picture of you.

2150
03:15:33,250 --> 03:15:34,250
Mom, I'm hungry.

2151
03:15:42,910 --> 03:15:43,910
I'm hungry.

2152
03:15:44,500 --> 03:15:45,490
I'm hungry.

2153
03:15:45,491 --> 03:15:46,550
I'm hungry.

2154
03:15:46,551 --> 03:15:48,671
I'm going to be found out
that I didn't wash my hair.

2155
03:16:17,720 --> 03:16:42,840
I'm going to be found out
that I didn't wash my hair.

2156
03:16:42,841 --> 03:16:43,841
She is wet.

2157
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:46,520
She is wet? Yeah.

2158
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:47,240


2159
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:48,760
She is wet all over.

2160
03:16:48,920 --> 03:16:49,920
She is wet.

2161
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:51,040
I'll wet her.

2162
03:16:51,180 --> 03:16:52,180
Isn't it good?

2163
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:54,660
No?

2164
03:16:54,920 --> 03:16:55,920
No?

2165
03:16:58,880 --> 03:17:00,980
Don't do it, or I'll get angry.

2166
03:17:03,430 --> 03:17:04,440
I won't.

2167
03:17:24,400 --> 03:17:25,460
I want to eat it.

2168
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:28,160
If I put it in my mouth, it will feel good.

2169
03:17:31,460 --> 03:17:32,340
I want to put it in my mouth.

2170
03:17:32,341 --> 03:17:32,640
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

2171
03:17:33,260 --> 03:17:34,660
Let's put it in the back.

2172
03:17:35,320 --> 03:17:36,340
In the back?

2173
03:17:37,360 --> 03:17:38,660
This angle is dangerous.

2174
03:17:42,680 --> 03:17:43,680
Let's put it in my mouth.

2175
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:45,236
I want to put it in my mouth.

2176
03:17:45,260 --> 03:17:46,260
Let's put it in my mouth.

2177
03:17:48,880 --> 03:17:51,400
It feels good.

2178
03:17:52,950 --> 03:17:54,320
Can you put it in?

2179
03:17:54,840 --> 03:17:55,840
Put it in?

2180
03:17:56,020 --> 03:17:57,020
Yes.

2181
03:17:57,260 --> 03:17:58,260
I want it.

2182
03:18:08,180 --> 03:18:09,220
I want to sleep.

2183
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:10,920
Me, too.

2184
03:18:19,980 --> 03:18:20,980
Manko is erotic.

2185
03:18:39,410 --> 03:18:40,410
I'm sorry.

2186
03:18:43,810 --> 03:18:44,810
It's not good.

2187
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:46,120
I feel so bad.

2188
03:18:48,410 --> 03:20:12,960
Lie down here.

2189
03:20:17,400 --> 03:20:36,610
The baby is coming out.

2190
03:20:37,890 --> 03:20:39,370
Do you want me to get it out?

2191
03:20:40,050 --> 03:20:52,240
No, I don't want to.

2192
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:22,360
You felt so good.

2193
03:21:22,800 --> 03:21:23,200
Did I?

2194
03:21:23,201 --> 03:21:24,201
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

2195
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:28,620


2196
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:29,760
Did you? Yes, I did.

2197
03:21:34,580 --> 03:22:11,290
Did you feel good? Yes, I did.

2198
03:22:15,310 --> 03:22:16,710
Do it again.

2199
03:22:16,730 --> 03:22:17,730
Do it again.

2200
03:22:18,790 --> 03:22:21,130


2201
03:22:23,965 --> 03:22:27,630
Again, again, again!

2202
03:22:28,270 --> 03:22:29,270
Everybody comes!

2203
03:22:30,430 --> 03:22:31,430
What, everyone comes!

2204
03:22:31,950 --> 03:22:32,950
Everybody comes! It's painful.

2205
03:22:34,990 --> 03:22:40,130
..

2206
03:22:41,190 --> 03:22:51,250
Hey, what?

2207
03:22:52,150 --> 03:22:53,650
What am I doing?

2208
03:22:54,035 --> 03:22:55,150
Still, I can't go out?

2209
03:22:55,650 --> 03:22:56,710
Already everybody comes!

2210
03:22:58,650 --> 03:22:59,650
It's coming out a lot.

2211
03:23:02,070 --> 03:23:05,310
Oh, no.

2212
03:23:26,650 --> 03:23:42,800
It's coming out a lot.

2213
03:23:44,870 --> 03:23:45,540
It's coming out a lot.

2214
03:23:45,541 --> 03:23:46,541
It's dripping.

2215
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:22,420
Hey.

2216
03:24:22,940 --> 03:24:23,940
What's up?

2217
03:24:24,160 --> 03:24:25,160
It's dripping a lot.

2218
03:24:26,720 --> 03:24:32,380
It's fast.

2219
03:24:33,260 --> 03:24:33,700
Can you bear it?

2220
03:24:34,020 --> 03:24:35,020
Yes.

2221
03:24:36,180 --> 03:24:37,700
Look at this.

2222
03:24:37,860 --> 03:24:38,120
Seishi.

2223
03:24:38,740 --> 03:24:39,740
Seishi.

2224
03:24:40,820 --> 03:24:41,820
Seishi.

2225
03:24:44,790 --> 03:24:46,130
Oh, no.

2226
03:24:46,490 --> 03:24:47,490
What?

2227
03:24:47,580 --> 03:24:49,050
Is it bitter? No, it's good.

2228
03:24:50,020 --> 03:24:51,390
Is it good?

2229
03:24:51,670 --> 03:24:52,670
Yes.

2230
03:24:53,010 --> 03:24:53,890
Is this enough?

2231
03:24:53,891 --> 03:24:55,290
What are you doing?

2232
03:24:56,900 --> 03:25:00,370
You do it on your own.

2233
03:25:16,010 --> 03:25:17,020
You put it in your mouth.

2234
03:25:17,021 --> 03:25:18,640
It's painful, isn't it?

2235
03:25:26,710 --> 03:25:27,960
How are you feeling?

2236
03:25:28,280 --> 03:25:29,460
Your face is so cute.

2237
03:25:31,690 --> 03:25:35,670
Are you ready?

2238
03:25:35,850 --> 03:25:36,850
Let's go together.

2239
03:25:38,410 --> 03:25:39,410
Let's go.

2240
03:25:43,360 --> 03:25:44,580
Let's go together.

2241
03:25:48,600 --> 03:25:50,000
Do you know what
it is? I don't know.

2242
03:25:50,180 --> 03:25:51,480
I feel good.

2243
03:25:52,130 --> 03:25:54,620
It's warm.

2244
03:25:54,660 --> 03:26:01,240


2245
03:26:02,480 --> 03:26:04,060
Is it full? It's dripping.

2246
03:26:07,400 --> 03:26:10,040
It's great.

2247
03:26:11,650 --> 03:26:12,650
It's full.

2248
03:26:15,730 --> 03:26:18,260
It's coming out.

2249
03:26:20,350 --> 03:26:21,350
I feel like I'm an angel.

2250
03:26:24,310 --> 03:26:28,080
It's coming out.

2251
03:26:29,250 --> 03:26:31,200
Help me! Help me!

2252
03:26:38,920 --> 03:26:41,500
It's coming out.

2253
03:26:41,501 --> 03:26:42,700
It's warm.

2254
03:26:49,070 --> 03:26:52,880
I'm going to take a picture of the cat.

2255
03:26:53,130 --> 03:26:54,680
The cat is coming out of the hole.

2256
03:26:54,681 --> 03:26:57,080
The cat is coming out of the hole.

2257
03:27:01,210 --> 03:27:03,560
I want to be comfortable with the cat.

2258
03:27:07,660 --> 03:27:10,220
The cat is coming out of the hole.

2259
03:27:11,120 --> 03:27:21,940
Maruyama Shrine

2260
03:27:54,700 --> 03:28:25,160
She's making her way into a baby's room.

2261
03:28:25,440 --> 03:28:26,440
Wow!

2262
03:28:26,800 --> 03:28:29,080
Are you OK? I'm excited.

2263
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:43,050


2264
03:28:45,430 --> 03:51:30,660
Oh, no! I'm going to fall.

2265
03:51:31,640 --> 03:51:33,080
I'm going to fall.

2266
03:51:33,081 --> 03:51:33,380
Oh, no! Oh, no!

2267
03:51:33,640 --> 03:51:34,140
Oh, no!

2268
03:51:34,180 --> 03:51:35,840
Oh, no!

2269
03:52:05,170 --> 03:52:06,960
I feel so bad!

2270
03:52:10,530 --> 03:53:27,870
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

2271
03:53:28,870 --> 03:54:06,230
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

2272
03:54:07,390 --> 03:54:07,590
Ouch!

2273
03:54:07,591 --> 03:54:08,591
It hurts!

2274
03:54:09,430 --> 03:54:10,430
It hurts!

2275
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:29,480
Nakadashi! Bye!

2276
03:57:30,200 --> 03:57:31,200
Nakadashi!

2277
03:57:32,260 --> 03:57:33,260
Nakadashi!

2278
03:57:45,620 --> 03:57:48,180
Nakadashi! Nakadashi!
