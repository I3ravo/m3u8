1
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,770
I wonder if Yuzuriha will come.

2
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,010
I'm sure they will.

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,111
They have a meeting with the PTA.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,401
It's a two-day trip to the
hot springs with Akazuma.

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,410
You should stay away for a while.

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,130
Chairman, don't say that.

7
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,131
Please don't say that.

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,510
You are hated by Yuuzuriha, aren't you?

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,950
Mr. Horii, please don't stalk me.

10
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,350
Are you still a member of PTA?

11
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,630
But the president is also
hated, isn't he? My son.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
..

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
He's a good boy.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,730
Your son, Kazumasa-kun,
was the first one to do it.

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,930
My son is not a bad boy.

16
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,230
My son is not a bad boy.

17
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:20,231
He's desperate.

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,550
He wants to be recognized as a good boy.

19
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:46,650
It's raining, but I'm looking
forward to the hot spring.

20
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,766
It's been a long time since
I've been to a hot spring.

21
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,950
It's been a long time since
I've been to a hot spring.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
What do you mean your wife can't come?

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,500
I participated in the story because my
husband and I were in the same class.

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,760
The girl below me had a fever.

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,260
It can't be helped.

26
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:10,740
I have a child, too.

27
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,260
And your husband doesn't
want to come, either.

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,540
It's the same thing.

29
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,160
My husband was called to work suddenly.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,820
But he will come in the evening.

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,240
Will he come?

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm sorry that my wife can't come.

33
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,041
I'm sorry I can't help you.

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,280
I have all the staff,
so there's no problem.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,240
That's right. Please get on quickly.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,940
I'll cut the meeting early.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Please spend the night with your
husband and your wife without water.

38
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,740
Izuihon's husband is running a
cafe in front of the station, right?

39
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,980
The owner of the
building and I are friends.

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,000
The owner of the building
put a claim in the cafe.

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,900
As expected, the president
of a real estate company.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,580
There are collaborators in various places.

43
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,860
Well, but I made some money.

44
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Hello.

45
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,360
Is this your husband?

46
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,940
I can smell coffee.

47
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,500
I don't think so.

48
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,980
He's taking good care of himself.

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,380
I hope he doesn't regret it.

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Is this really the Akane 3rd floor?

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,860
It's very different from
the picture on the website.

52
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,840
It's a business, so it's a little bad.

53
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,920
But it's true, it's the Akane 3rd floor.

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
It's a premonition that
Showa literature loved.

55
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,570
Is that so? Welcome.

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600


57
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,580
You are a PTA staff, aren't you?

58
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,100
I'll show you your room,
so please follow me.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,840
I'll take your luggage.

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you.

61
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,740
Here you are.

62
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:33,640
It's delicious.

63
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,160
I can't get enough of it.

64
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,880
It's good.

65
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,220
I'm so happy.

66
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,100
Stop it.

67
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:45,280
Excuse me.
We haven't had a meeting for a while.

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,460
Well, well. We're on a trip after all.

69
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,621
How about a drink, Mr.

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,060
Yuzuriha? He doesn't want to.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Stop it!

72
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, I'll take it.

73
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,220
Excuse me.

74
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,580
What?

75
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,260
I told you, it's a wedding ceremony.

76
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,320
But, I think Atsushi doesn't like it.

77
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,240
I think it will change
if we hold a ceremony.

78
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:49,540
I don't think so. I don't feel it now
that Karen has become a mother.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't know.

80
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,890
A little.

81
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,150
I'm sorry, Dad.

82
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,350
I'm fine.

83
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,630
Oh, there she is.

84
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,290
It's a woman. It's a woman at this time.

85
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:35,970
Actually, I have something
important to tell you.

86
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,390
What is it?

87
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,850
It's Atsushi's fault.

88
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,650
It's about last month.

89
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:05,790
Atsushi drove around my car and
crashed into the car in front of me.

90
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
I was drunk.

91
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,750
I was drinking alcohol
without a driver's license.

92
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,580
It's a lie.

93
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
It's true.

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,020
My daughter was also in the car.

95
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,720
But don't worry.

96
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,760
I paid the tax and wiped it off.

97
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,180
How much?

98
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:40,061
What do you mean?
I have to pay the repair fee.

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
It's not about the money.

100
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,400
It's your responsibility.

101
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,160
Am I wrong? You're right.

102
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,700


103
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,840
Please come here.

104
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm glad you understand.

105
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,620
Please spare my body.

106
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,000
Are you stupid?

107
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,040
You only have a body and no bones.

108
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,920
Please, if this becomes public, my
daughter will be expelled from school.

109
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Please.

110
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Sakuma, help her.

111
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,870
Do you think you can
stay calm in this body?

112
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,190
I'll lick your body.

113
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,930
I'll lick your eyes.

114
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,230
That's right.

115
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,690
I'm like this.

116
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,698
This is the first time I've
ever seen such a scene in

117
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,910
my life, and I'm very happy
that I was able to do it.

118
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm very happy that I was able to do it.

119
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,080
Did you really
do it? Yes, I did.

120
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,360


121
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,720
What are you doing?

122
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,780
You can't just do it.

123
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,580
You have to throw mine properly.

124
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,060
Takuma, you have to make it in time.

125
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,200
I can't do anything.

126
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,310
I have a chance evidence.

127
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,540
Just for now, just for now.

128
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,740
If you bear it, it will be solved.

129
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:20,480
You never lick my shoulder compared
to the future of your child, do you?

130
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,520
No, you have to do it properly.

131
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,300
You have to pull my
armpit and lick it properly.

132
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,460
You did it well. I'll reward you properly.

133
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:28,080
If it's a finger, it's still a low hurdle.

134
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,080
Takuma, are you licking it properly?

135
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,450
Not only Tetsu-san, but
Tetsu-san also licks it firmly.

136
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,870
You licked it properly.

137
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,100
You licked it well.

138
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,360
Look, look.

139
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:08,210
Are you OK?

140
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,850
The future of your
precious son is at stake.

141
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,720
You shouldn't just feel good.

142
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,800
Look at me.

143
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,801
Please lick my neck.

144
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,070
You don't have to lick my neck yet.

145
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:58,060
Satsuma.

146
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,240
How do you feel about
Yuzuriya's back? I feel better.

147
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,880


148
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Oh, you feel better.

149
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
No, no, no.

150
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,061
You feel better.

151
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,640
It's no good.

152
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,570
Let's lick it in this state next time.

153
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,970
You have to do it properly.

154
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,650
Sakuma, look, here too.

155
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,490
Let's do our best for the child.

156
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,000
Let Maoko lick a lot and live.

157
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,790
Sakuma, you did your best.

158
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,970
Sakuma, you did your best.

159
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
You did your best.

160
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,320
Yulia, you felt good, didn't you?

161
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,120
Then, you have to serve me more.

162
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,840
I'll turn my butt to you.

163
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,980
This time, you lick my butt.

164
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,200
I have a video of the accident.

165
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,940
I'll shake your butt.

166
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,221
Do you want me to rub your back?

167
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,060
You are a good boy.

168
00:21:29,480 --> 00:22:02,360
You are a good boy.

169
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,200
Do you do this to your
husband? Yes, I do.

170
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,580
Good boy.

171
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,660


172
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,950
You can lick my back.

173
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,080
This time, I will rub your belly.

174
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,050
You are a good boy.

175
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,490
It's the best.

176
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,940
If you don't wash properly,

177
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,960
I don't know what will happen to you.

178
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,210
Sakuma's daughter's future is at stake.

179
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,710
So you have to wash properly.

180
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,150
You're doing well.

181
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,720
Hey, Sakuma.

182
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,780
You want me to wash you, don't you?

183
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:09,020
Sakuma wants me to wash his hands.

184
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
He is crouching.

185
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,130
Sakuma, wash his hands.

186
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,430
He is rubbing his hands.

187
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,750
Sakuma, wash your hands.

188
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,390
Sakuma, do you like bread?

189
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,890
I think my bread is better.

190
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,270
I'll wash my hands, too.

191
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:45,420
This is Sakuma's.

192
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,660
And this is mine.

193
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
OK.

194
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,760
Come closer to me.

195
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,700
Let's lick together.

196
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
It's fun.

197
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,790
Yuzuriha-san.

198
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,370
How do you feel?

199
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,660
You don't say anything.

200
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
This is my shampoo.

201
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,260
I'll finish it tomorrow.

202
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Oh!

203
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,940
I don't know about that.

204
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,420
If you don't take good care of her,

205
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,580
I can't delete that video.

206
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,280
Please do your best.

207
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,160
Oops! It's dangerous.

208
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:26,161


209
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,320
You ate this big.

210
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,780
You did well.

211
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,740
Sakuma, sit here.

212
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
You have to eat this.

213
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm sorry.

214
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
You are sorry?

215
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:38,480
You're not a child anymore, so
there's no excuse for this, right?

216
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,620
Please stop that.

217
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,680
No, no, no.

218
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,520
Oh, you're attacking the entrance.

219
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,940
If you're going to be so rough,
I'm going to stab you in the butt.

220
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:55,941
Don't do that.

221
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,140
You are already in the Showa era.

222
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
No, I'm not.

223
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,730
Hold on a little more.

224
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,100
Rubber...

225
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,500
Rubber is not narrow.

226
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,900
I'm a Showa man.

227
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,100
There is no such thing as a condom.

228
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,150
Why?

229
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,690
Why? Why?

230
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,690
It's too intense.

231
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,210
Too intense? It's too hot.

232
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,170


233
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,330
I want to throw you in the water.

234
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,630
No, no, no.

235
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,170
It's too cold.

236
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,570
Wait, I'll do it.

237
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:20,430
I'm going to lick your
nipples, not just your nipples.

238
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:39,230
I'm going to lick your
nipples, not just your nipples.

239
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:43,850
Let me see your feet.

240
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,230
Look at your feet.

241
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm going to lick your nipples.

242
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,120
Mom, I can't do it.

243
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
You've done your best so
far, so let's do a little more.

244
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,540
You're doing a good job.

245
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,080
This is the real mother figure.

246
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,850
Can I be fierce?

247
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,690
I might say it later.

248
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,090
I can't do it.

249
00:33:27,091 --> 00:33:30,430
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

250
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,620
Ahhhhhhh!

251
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,200
Ahhhhhhh!

252
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,160
Ahhhhhhh!

253
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,360
Ahhhhhhh!

254
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,780
What? Why are you trying to run?

255
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,980
Ahhhhhhh!

256
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,640
Let me hold you, Otomi.

257
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,800
Ahhhhhhh!

258
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,440
Ahhhhhhh!

259
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,700
Ahhhh!

260
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:11,760
Ahhhhhhh!

261
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:11,920
Oh, my!

262
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Oh, my!

263
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,400
Ahhhhhhh!

264
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Oh, my!

265
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
You want to get in the water, don't you?

266
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,160
You don't have to get in the water.

267
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:50,440
Are you ready?

268
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,430
You shouldn't do that.

269
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:28,431
What's going on?

270
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,200
You are amazing.

271
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,190
Do you feel good?

272
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:26,910
I'm glad you feel better
thanks to miso soup.

273
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,510
I'm glad.

274
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,210
Asakuma, you feel better, don't you?

275
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,660
Now, let's get you on my back.

276
00:37:57,661 --> 00:37:58,680
「Hey, let's go home.

277
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,680
」 「No, I can't go
home. I can't go home.

278
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:10,580
」 「Hey, you shouldn't
be with me and Sakema.

279
00:38:33,700 --> 00:39:01,670
」 「Shake your hip for
your son. You've grown up.

280
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:15,320
」 「Are you watching
Sakema? You're a good woman.

281
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,730
」 Don't look at me so much.

282
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,950
I wish I had come out of this cocoon.

283
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,450
You are the worst.

284
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,010
You are the worst.

285
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,730
But I feel better now.

286
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,410
What's wrong?

287
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,960
Are you waiting to go again?

288
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,840
Put your hand here.

289
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:35,200
Well, I'll do it.

290
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,500
Let me move more.

291
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,020
I'm sorry.

292
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:12,080
What are you doing?

293
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,290
You can wear it.

294
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,850
I want to do it more.

295
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,510
You can wear it wherever you like.

296
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,780
Show me your teeth.

297
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,680
You are cute.

298
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,270
This is also hot.

299
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,480
I feel so good.

300
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,910
I can't stand it anymore.

301
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,430
No, no, no.

302
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:01,950
Let's take her inside.

303
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,190
No, no, no.

304
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,350
Let's take her inside.

305
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,450
Please, no.

306
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,590
Listen, it's an order.

307
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,530
I'll take you inside.

308
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,930
I'll take you inside.

309
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:12,590
No, no, no.

310
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:14,350
Please, no.

311
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:14,510
I'll take you inside.

312
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,790
Please, no.

313
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,290
It's dangerous.

314
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,750
Please, no.

315
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,490
There was no choice but to do this.

316
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,290
It's amazing.

317
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,130
It's completely exposed.

318
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,100
But it's still not enough.

319
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,530
It's over there.

320
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,590
It's going to be horizontal over there.

321
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,620
I'll put it in.

322
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,840
Can I put this
in too? I'm sorry.

323
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,300


324
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,880
Please, don't cry.

325
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
I'm sorry.

326
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,420
Can you do it? Please.

327
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,410


328
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
What?

329
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,480
You were good at it.

330
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,420
No, I'm not.

331
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,400
I'm not kidding.

332
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
I can do it.

333
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,420
What can you do?

334
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,160
Tell me what you can do.

335
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,680
What can I do?

336
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,940
What can you do? I don't know.

337
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,281
What can you do? I don't know.

338
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,960


339
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,930
You don't know what you can do.

340
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,450
It's so cold.

341
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:07,010
I think I'm dying... I'll be OK.

342
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:08,830
I'll be OK.

343
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Oh!

344
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,670
You may be in love.

345
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:49,640
If you know you can't
escape, I'll let you go.

346
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,780
Then, I'll do it with my mouth.

347
00:51:18,915 --> 00:51:22,510
Come here.

348
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,470
Will you really erase it?

349
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,360
I'll do my best.

350
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,250
Wait a minute.

351
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:10,430
Look, Chinchin doesn't just lick
his tail, he licks his balls as well.

352
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,970
He licks his balls as well.

353
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,640
He doesn't just lick his balls,
he licks his mouth as well.

354
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,650
You know it well.

355
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:46,630
When you lick a ball, you have
to squeeze it with your hand.

356
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Like this?

357
00:55:09,275 --> 00:55:10,920
You have to squeeze it more slowly.

358
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,040
Let me enjoy eating for a long time.

359
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,150
Do you want to eat a lot of salmon?

360
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,321
You still have to eat it with your mouth.

361
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,050
Try to eat it with your mouth this time.

362
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,630
Did you eat it well?

363
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,490
If you eat it,

364
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,480
this will touch your nipples.

365
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,910
Don't touch me.

366
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:56,450
Touch me and move your mouth slowly.

367
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,240
Izuya-san,

368
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,041
You have such a nice boob.

369
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,380
Can you pinch my
boob? Pinch my boob.

370
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,980


371
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,590
You can do this much,
can't you? It's okay.

372
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,630


373
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,910
Then, can I hold the video
all the time? That's right.

374
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,770


375
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,580
Like this? That's right.

376
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,640
That's right.

377
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:06,200
Can you put a toothpick
on my dick while pinching it?

378
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:24,450
Yuzuha-san, do you know
how to make me feel better?

379
00:59:24,451 --> 00:59:25,451
Like this? That's right.

380
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,550


381
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,711
Yuzuha-san, this feels good, doesn't it?

382
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,400
I'll show you how to make me feel better.

383
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,980
I'll show you how to do it.

384
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,120
I'm going to stick my
nipple on your nipple.

385
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:50,850
You can do it, right? Oh, yeah.

386
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,180


387
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,820
It's a little slippery.

388
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,631
I'm going to stick my
nipple on your nipple.

389
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,030
Did you do it?

390
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,860
Now you feel good,
don't you? The other side.

391
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320
That's right.

392
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,770
Squeeze it.

393
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:19,370
Oh, it's coming out.

394
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,360
I'm getting confused.

395
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,420
Let's eat again.

396
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,420
You've gotten much better.

397
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,671
Did you get confused because I pinched you?

398
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,100
I'll give you a reward if you slurp.

399
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,260
I'll give it to you.

400
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:17,910
Swallow it well.

401
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:30,870
Oh, no.

402
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:32,710
Oh, I'm almost there.

403
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,310
All right.

404
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,070
Oh, I'm almost there.

405
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,470
Oh, I'm almost there.

406
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:42,610
Oh, I'm almost there.

407
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:50,890
Oh, I'm almost there.

408
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:59,030
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

409
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:01,110
How is it?

410
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,981
Let me see the sesame seeds in your mouth.

411
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:06,996
Oh, you've received it well.

412
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:30,690
You've done a good job.

413
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,130
Look, I've erased it.

414
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,960
I'll come again.

415
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,890
Hello?

416
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:41,710
You?

417
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,510
Are you Kallen? I called you many times.

418
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:49,310
By the way, when are you coming here?

419
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,590
I'm already here. It's the
third floor, isn't it? Yes, but.

420
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,640
..

421
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:59,260
But it's a great inn.

422
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,060
The whole room is an ocean
view, and the golf course is closed.

423
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,860
It's expensive.

424
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,900
What do you mean?

425
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,860
There's no beach or golf course here.

426
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,580
There's no way there isn't.

427
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,880
I'm sorry, I'm hanging up.

428
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,860
Karen?

429
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:47,000
Excuse me, is anyone there?

430
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,300
Please help me! Karen.

431
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,460
..

432
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,960
Let me go.

433
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,070
What?

434
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,780
If I stay here, I'll...

435
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:27,830
I stole the black key.

436
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:31,530
Let's go.

437
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,380
I'm sorry about the hot spring.

438
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,760
I was threatened.

439
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,490
Let's forget about it.

440
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:01,856
I don't think I can forget it.

441
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,940
Can I ask you one last time?

442
01:10:10,825 --> 01:10:11,906
What are you talking about?

443
01:10:13,935 --> 01:10:15,616
I'm betting on my daughter and the scales.

444
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:20,086
If she finds out that I'm
the one who let her go,

445
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:22,820
I don't know what kind of
harassment she'll do to my daughter.

446
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:29,600
I don't know if I can do it, but if I have
a memory with Kanetsu, I'll give up.

447
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,520
If you refuse,

448
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,620
I can't get out of the car.

449
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:57,540
Kotoko, if you ask me, I'll do it.

450
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,200
Please bear with me.

451
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,600
I'm sorry to make you do it every week.

452
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,420
Double life?

453
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,800
Isn't it a double life to give birth to a
body to do something? Please stop.

454
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,360
No, I can't.

455
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,960
Oh, my God.

456
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,260
You are wet.

457
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,690
I'm sorry.

458
01:18:58,691 --> 01:18:59,691


459
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:25,360
I became a PTA because you left.

460
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,820
I've always liked you.

461
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,840
Please go.

462
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,560
Can you love me now?

463
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:58,340
I have a son, too.

464
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,180
He's alive.

465
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,460
Can I take him
out? No, you can't.

466
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:59,000
I'll take responsibility.

467
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,060
That's not the problem.

468
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:49,600
I'm tired, aren't I? You can sleep.

469
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,550
Karen, we've arrived.

470
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,130
I'm sorry.

471
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,020
I don't want this guy!

472
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:02,021
No, I don't want it.

473
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,680
Chairman.

474
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:11,940
She can't stand it.

475
01:23:11,941 --> 01:23:21,040
Let me wear this.

476
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,340
Is this OK?

477
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,530
I'm begging you.

478
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,540
Wow! Look at me.

479
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:29,880


480
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,940
You are looking at me.

481
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,280
Wow!

482
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:07,450
What's wrong?

483
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:11,450
You feel good, don't
you? I'll show you.

484
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,600
Look at me.

485
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,760


486
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,860
Look at my tongue.

487
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,800
You're not honest.

488
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,450
This is...

489
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,760
...Sakuma's.

490
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,840
You should be honest.

491
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:17,950
It feels good, doesn't it?

492
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,820
Even if you're his mother...

493
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:30,380
Hatsushi-kun won't admit it.

494
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:42,650
I've been asked what I
should do to get you out of here.

495
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:52,740
So I told him to worry about you.

496
01:26:54,790 --> 01:27:03,100
Well, if you drink alcohol and
drive a car, you'll be in trouble.

497
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:09,540
Well, if you do that, you'll
be able to get out of it.

498
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:17,680
But I didn't think it
would cause an accident.

499
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:32,260
I didn't think it would be like this.

500
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,340
Dig!

501
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,200
No! No! Wait! No!

502
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,020
Dig!

503
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,520
No!

504
01:27:43,115 --> 01:27:44,115
I don't like this guy.

505
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:48,490
You were abandoned by a child.

506
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:52,370
Your mother is disqualified.

507
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:05,170
Mom, you should stop it.

508
01:28:15,605 --> 01:28:16,920
It feels good, doesn't
it? Yes, it does.

509
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:21,760
Well said.

510
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,040
It's all right.

511
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,140
That's right.

512
01:28:31,141 --> 01:28:32,141


513
01:28:34,155 --> 01:28:36,220
You are abandoned by your son.

514
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,500
I'll give you a good treat.

515
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,880
I'll treat you well.

516
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,880
Do you understand?
I'll lick you.

517
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,580


518
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,700
I've seen it in my dream.

519
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,460
This is Yuzuruha's pussy.

520
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,820
Great.

521
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,250
Pussy.

522
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:31,150
It's so flabby.

523
01:29:31,151 --> 01:29:32,151
What are you doing?

524
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,350
Don't open your eyes too much.

525
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,070
I'll burn it on your eyes.

526
01:29:43,095 --> 01:29:44,095
I can't stand it.

527
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:50,550
I'm glad you got a lot
of attention from me.

528
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,310
I'm so moved.

529
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,810
May I?

530
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:03,290
Of course, it's okay.

531
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,950
Please lick me a lot.

532
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,050
Please.

533
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:31,240
Don't be in a hurry.

534
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,500
Enjoy it slowly.

535
01:30:33,501 --> 01:30:34,520
You have to taste more.

536
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:57,640
We are on your side from now on.

537
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:07,360
Let's do it.

538
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:24,530
It's getting very edgy.

539
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,560
Do you feel it?

540
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,570
Do you feel being licked
like this? Answer me.

541
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,810
It feels good.

542
01:31:39,725 --> 01:31:53,000


543
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,640
It's good, isn't it?

544
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:14,470
You shouldn't just feel good.

545
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:25,080
Don't lick me.

546
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,240
You have to lick me.

547
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,160
You are the best.

548
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:42,860
You licked me.

549
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,820
You look great.

550
01:33:40,275 --> 01:33:42,490
I want to do this.

551
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:47,630
I want to lick you more and more.

552
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:03,840
You look good.

553
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:26,040
I'm going to put a bandage on your back.

554
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:31,320
I'm going to put a bandage on your back.

555
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,560
Oh, my God.

556
01:34:36,561 --> 01:34:37,561
Oh, my God.

557
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:54,620
You are eating so much.

558
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,480
You are eating so much.

559
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,560
Good boy.

560
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:36,840
You are wonderful.

561
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:44,960
You are amazing.

562
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,100
You look sleepy, even
though I prepared it for you.

563
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,200
Do you want me to
pet you? You look good.

564
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,200


565
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,640
Do you want me to pet you?

566
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,520
As I expected, you want me to pet you.

567
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,980
Let me touch your belly.

568
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:15,640
You have loved me for
a long time, haven't you?

569
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,620
Do you want to be touched by everyone?

570
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,240
You are so sleepy.

571
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,301
Do you want me to give you a kiss?

572
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,460
Then, I will give you
a kiss with my finger.

573
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,500
Can you see it?

574
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,060
Yes, I can see it.

575
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,420
Please don't attack me with three people.

576
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,440
What's wrong with
you? It's intense.

577
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:26,980
Three people.

578
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:30,110


579
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,830
I'm being bullied.

580
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:47,831
Boss!

581
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:58,680
You are so messy.

582
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:09,980
I'm so happy.

583
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,820
You've been like this since a while ago.

584
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,730
I'm going to tickle you
while looking at your wife.

585
01:39:38,525 --> 01:39:44,310
I love you!

586
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,311
I love you!

587
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:54,970
She's finally getting the hang of it.

588
01:40:00,055 --> 01:40:03,360
You're the only one I can rely on.

589
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,240
She finally understands.

590
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:11,140
I'm so happy.

591
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:22,040
I'm going to give you a massage.

592
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:55,020
Please enjoy this video.

593
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:56,300
Please enjoy this video.

594
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:57,301
Are you okay?

595
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:31,890
You've had a hard time,
but you're still drooling.

596
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:33,850
You are so kind.

597
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:35,070
You have a good heart.

598
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,410
It's like a dream.

599
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:48,890
This is... Yuzuriha-san's
mouth is...

600
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:56,430
I'd like you to lick me, but...
No, no, no, not the penis.

601
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:59,770
This one first.

602
01:42:02,565 --> 01:42:04,230
Oh!

603
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:09,090
Oh!

604
01:42:09,091 --> 01:42:10,091
Ah!

605
01:42:10,765 --> 01:42:12,030
Oh!

606
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:16,890
Oh!

607
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:40,150
You can swallow more.

608
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,570
How does it taste?

609
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,500
Is it good? It's good.

610
01:42:56,930 --> 01:42:57,930


611
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:01,290
You can taste a lot.

612
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:15,770
I'm going to put both
your hips on your chest.

613
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:19,610
I'm going to do the same.

614
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:41,650
Look at me.

615
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:52,260
I'm so happy to have you do this for me.

616
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:53,820
I know.

617
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:54,821
This is great, isn't it?

618
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,840
This is the best.

619
01:44:01,965 --> 01:44:04,200
This is all thanks to you, Natsushi.

620
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:10,171
Do you want me to lick you?

621
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,540
Ah…

622
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,880
Ah... Ah...

623
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,140
Oh...

624
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,880
Ah...

625
01:44:39,915 --> 01:44:46,710
Oh, it feels good.

626
01:44:46,930 --> 01:44:48,170
You are so happy.

627
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:52,090
You can do things like this with
the boobs of a home-cooked meal.

628
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:55,050
I can't believe you did this to me.

629
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:59,710
I'm going to be eaten.

630
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:03,570
I'm going to be eaten.

631
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:08,790
I'm going to be eaten.

632
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:21,540
I'm going to be eaten.

633
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:59,291
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

634
01:45:59,303 --> 01:46:29,460
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

635
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,260
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

636
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:46,600
I'm sorry.

637
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,020
This is a video of the process
of making a baby's first baby.

638
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:26,220
Baby's first baby will
be born in a few weeks.

639
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,416
Baby's first baby is a
baby with a lot of hair.

640
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,906
Baby's first baby is a
baby with a lot of hair.

641
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:32,360
Wait a minute.

642
01:47:32,361 --> 01:47:33,780
Let's start.

643
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,500
Oh, it's hot.

644
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,940
I won't let you go.

645
01:47:49,025 --> 01:47:55,780
Don't choke on it so much.

646
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:57,740
You're going to die soon.

647
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:01,950
It's delicious.

648
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:03,040
How do you feel? Good girl.

649
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:04,180
Good girl.

650
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:07,040
Look, look.

651
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,080
Don't let go.

652
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:15,860


653
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,480
I did it too hard.

654
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,820
You haven't done it too hard yet.

655
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,320
I'm going to die.

656
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:09,160
I'm going to die.

657
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,080
I can't. I can't.

658
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:20,360
It's amazing.

659
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:23,840
It's so smooth and warm.

660
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,120
Is it like this?

661
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:30,080
Then, I'll put you in the box I dreamed of.

662
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:33,150
Yes.

663
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:33,900
May I? Of course.

664
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,400


665
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:41,720
Are you going to sleep?

666
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,640
This is a dream.

667
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,800
Let me taste it slowly.

668
01:49:58,770 --> 01:50:01,480
If you do it quickly, you will go soon.

669
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,360
No, you will go soon.

670
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,220
She says she feels very good.

671
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:37,040
I want to see her face.

672
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:38,041
It hurts.

673
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,040
Oh, I see.

674
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,920
You are so cute.

675
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:43,840
Look at me.

676
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,620
You are having sex with
Izumiha-san, aren't you?

677
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:57,240
You are so cute.

678
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,340
I'm so happy.

679
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:24,950
You should eat mine, too.

680
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:51,120
You move a lot.

681
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,400
What should I do? It's tight.

682
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,690


683
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:09,370
You are eating well.

684
01:52:51,165 --> 01:52:53,770
The baby is crying.

685
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:58,270
You are very strong.

686
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:00,020
The baby is crying.

687
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:09,910
The baby is crying.

688
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:12,750
You are strong.

689
01:53:12,751 --> 01:53:22,410
I feel good.

690
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:25,890
〔Crying〕

691
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:43,410
Hey, you two, hold on to this.

692
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:44,550
Yes.

693
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:49,310
Wow, what a view.

694
01:53:49,311 --> 01:53:50,950
You are a good boy.

695
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:05,770
You ate one.

696
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,570
Can you see it? You ate two.

697
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,530


698
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,810
Can I taste a lot?

699
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:28,690
Can I?

700
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:38,200
No, I don't want to eat.

701
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:41,220
It's delicious.

702
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,140
Change the bowl.

703
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:49,320
You have to put it in by yourself.

704
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:14,820
You have to taste my shape.

705
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:29,190
I'm so happy that I can't do anything.

706
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:33,930
I also feel very good.

707
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:34,931
It's good.

708
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:38,510
You can see it.

709
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:50,690
It's connected well.

710
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:54,800
How about this? It feels great.

711
01:56:59,210 --> 01:57:00,690


712
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:03,350
You shouldn't hold it like this.

713
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,200
Then, I'll hold it like this.

714
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:36,420
Let me see.

715
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:49,580
I'm touching you properly.

716
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,320
I'm touching you properly.

717
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:04,580
I'm so happy.

718
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:07,740
I'm so happy.

719
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:09,300
I feel so good.

720
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:24,520
I'm so tired.

721
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:43,410
Yuzuru-san, how
is it? It's delicious.

722
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:46,510


723
02:00:47,150 --> 02:00:49,530
It's really, really delicious.

724
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:52,690
You can taste a lot.

725
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:35,130
It's not bad to be so slow.

726
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:14,830
Let's go! Let's go!

727
02:03:14,831 --> 02:03:16,150
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

728
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,960
I won't stop you.

729
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:25,740
I won't stop you.

730
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,580
Your ears are turning red.

731
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:33,100
It must feel good.

732
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:13,300
Can you see?

733
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:17,580
Wow!

734
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:27,120
You two get along well.

735
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:06,430
I feel sick.

736
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:10,770
I feel sick.

737
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:15,550
I feel sick.

738
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:16,710
I feel sick.

739
02:05:16,711 --> 02:05:18,530
Go! Go! Go!

740
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:35,120
I've had it out.

741
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,720
You've had it out?

742
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,960
Ah, it feels good.

743
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:49,300
No way.

744
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:51,080
Now, the other side.

745
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:20,440
I'm sorry.

746
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:22,020
I'm sorry.

747
02:06:56,650 --> 02:06:57,650
I'm going to sleep.

748
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:58,430
I'm going to sleep.

749
02:06:58,431 --> 02:06:59,671
It's better to sleep like this.

750
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:01,830
I'm going to sleep.

751
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:03,150
I'm going to sleep.

752
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:05,790
I don't want to sleep.

753
02:07:05,791 --> 02:07:06,791
Oh, no! Hey, wait.

754
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:29,900
This way.

755
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:31,740


756
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:56,100
It feels good, doesn't
it? It feels good.

757
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:58,800


758
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:04,040
You are a failure as a mother,
but you are the best as a woman.

759
02:08:04,041 --> 02:08:05,041
It's okay.

760
02:08:33,860 --> 02:08:34,860
It's the best.

761
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:43,380
I can't do it anymore.

762
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:40,100
Oh, you can walk now.

763
02:10:38,565 --> 02:10:46,650
I'm getting bigger.

764
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:48,950
Yes, you are.

765
02:10:51,710 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm so tired. Help me.

766
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:40,000
You are used to it, right?

767
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:42,940
Yes, but I won't let you go.

768
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,660
Hey, Atsushi, come here.
I'll leave you here.

769
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:20,130
President, let me do it too.

770
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,950
Ask the woman.

771
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:27,470
Hey, what do you think?

772
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:36,390
Is it okay not to say anything?

773
02:13:36,391 --> 02:13:37,711
I wonder if that's what it means.

774
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:43,710
It's dirty.

775
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:45,290
You put out too much.

776
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:50,050
You have to clean it up.

777
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:52,290
No, I'll get drunk.

778
02:13:53,110 --> 02:13:54,690
You're noisy.

779
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:57,890
I'll clean it up.

780
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,190
No, no.

781
02:14:01,430 --> 02:14:02,790
No, no.

782
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:07,390
I can't drink alcohol.

783
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:09,770
What?

784
02:14:10,370 --> 02:14:11,370
You can't?

785
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:14,010
Then I'll suck you up.

786
02:14:16,210 --> 02:14:17,390
Are you clean now?

787
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:27,341
You're drunk too, aren't you?

788
02:14:29,740 --> 02:14:31,120
The bowl is good.

789
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:57,740
I'm so excited about tomorrow.

790
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:00,020
You can't do that.

791
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,380
I can't wait.

792
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:08,310
I'm going to drink more.

793
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:12,780
You're always enthusiastic.

794
02:15:12,781 --> 02:15:13,781
What are you doing?

795
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:42,170
You want to drink, don't you?

796
02:15:56,170 --> 02:15:57,210
I'll make you drink a lot.

797
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:05,620
It was delicious.

798
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,070
You are the sweetest in this body.

799
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:19,390
You're licking again.

800
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:22,020
Come on.

801
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:24,570
To the back.

802
02:16:25,890 --> 02:16:27,230
Did you drink a lot? Yes, yes.

803
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:30,270


804
02:16:31,110 --> 02:16:34,600
Does it feel good?

805
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:42,240
How do you feel? It feels good.

806
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:43,840


807
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:46,180
Really?

808
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:50,460
You're really good at it.

809
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,180
Wait, wait, wait.

810
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:54,620
You can't do that.

811
02:16:54,970 --> 02:16:56,260
Let me see.

812
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:58,200
Sorry.

813
02:16:58,201 --> 02:16:59,201
I'm sorry.

814
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:00,620
Hey, hey, hey.

815
02:17:00,890 --> 02:17:03,480
You came back a little while
ago, didn't you? Look at this.

816
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:06,180


817
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:09,340
Look, look, look.

818
02:17:10,765 --> 02:17:13,760
Oh, you have a lot of hair and it's loose.

819
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:20,300
From here, the grass...

820
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,370
It's coming out more and more.

821
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:27,450
That's great.

822
02:17:27,451 --> 02:17:28,970
How much did you put out?

823
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:32,090
You can't help it, can you?

824
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:33,950
Because it's a very good book.

825
02:17:34,590 --> 02:17:35,750
You can't help it, can you?

826
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:38,530
Is it here?

827
02:17:39,430 --> 02:17:40,430
Is it here?

828
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:46,400
I'll give you more reactions.

829
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:58,890
What's wrong?

830
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:00,090
What's wrong?

831
02:18:00,091 --> 02:18:02,310
I can't take it anymore.

832
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:05,090
No, no, no, no!

833
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:16,870
You're not like you.

834
02:18:17,650 --> 02:18:19,530
I knew it.

835
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:24,250
I'm too bad for you.
You got married and you're a guy.

836
02:18:24,251 --> 02:18:25,410
I know.

837
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:30,470
Why don't you come out
when it's my turn? I'm sorry.

838
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:33,590


839
02:18:34,470 --> 02:18:35,870
I can't help it. My arms are tired.

840
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:38,350
Do you really think it's bad?

841
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:44,110
Then you have to show
me with your attitude.

842
02:18:44,111 --> 02:18:45,752
You have to show it to me with your body.

843
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,950
If you do it to me, you
have to do it properly.

844
02:18:58,951 --> 02:19:00,950
I'm going to kiss you.

845
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,230
Look at my eyes.

846
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:03,290
I'm going to give you a massage.

847
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:16,720
I can't stand it.

848
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:28,900
You are taking a rest.

849
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:39,490
You are really a grumpy woman.

850
02:20:41,530 --> 02:20:42,530
I think so.

851
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:45,430
It takes a little time to do this.

852
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:32,450
Is it okay to lick only the nipples?

853
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:36,560
It's wrong, isn't it?

854
02:22:10,630 --> 02:22:11,950
Hey, you have to shovel properly.

855
02:22:12,460 --> 02:22:13,460
Yes.

856
02:22:14,545 --> 02:22:16,625
You have to not only
shovel but also taste properly.

857
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:19,040
Yes.

858
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:31,389
This is the first time I've
had a baby, so I'm a little

859
02:22:31,401 --> 02:22:33,136
nervous, but I'm sure it's
going to be a good baby.

860
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,020
I'm sure it's going to be a good baby.

861
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:42,940
I'm sure it's going to be a good baby.

862
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:58,530
I'm going to have a bath.

863
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:22,510
I'm going to have a bath.

864
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:26,830
※This is the sound of a baby eating.

865
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:48,180
You can't eat it all?

866
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:18,240
Oh, you really love it.

867
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:29,900
Come here.

868
02:24:36,890 --> 02:24:37,890
Like this? That's right.

869
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:57,300
Ah...

870
02:25:03,790 --> 02:25:05,780
You're talking and making a mess.

871
02:25:08,530 --> 02:25:09,780
I'm so tired.

872
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:14,720
And I'm drunk.

873
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:40,780
I'm sorry.

874
02:25:40,781 --> 02:25:41,781
Oh, no.

875
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,880
You've been poked in the front and back.

876
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:50,820
Does it feel good?

877
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:54,520
Yes, it feels good.

878
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:57,980
Oh, it feels good.

879
02:26:02,110 --> 02:26:06,020
「It's delicious!」

880
02:26:19,890 --> 02:26:27,460
「No, no, please, no!」

881
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:31,540
「No, no, please,
no!」 I'm so scared.

882
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:29,380


883
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:45,790
Calm down, calm down.

884
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:59,380
I'm going to put it in.

885
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:01,610
Try putting it in yourself.

886
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,060
Yes.

887
02:29:45,850 --> 02:29:47,330
Ah, it feels good.

888
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:48,770
Does it feel good?

889
02:29:48,771 --> 02:29:48,870
Do you feel good? Yes, I do.

890
02:29:49,540 --> 02:29:50,830
I feel so good.

891
02:30:07,690 --> 02:30:13,110


892
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:14,870
You have a nice waist.

893
02:30:19,150 --> 02:30:20,150
You must be lonely.

894
02:30:22,140 --> 02:30:23,570
Yes, I am.

895
02:30:51,390 --> 02:30:52,390
Here you are.

896
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:54,330
Here you are.

897
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:31,820
It's hot.

898
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:41,340
I'm sorry.

899
02:31:42,740 --> 02:31:43,640
It's okay.

900
02:32:21,660 --> 02:32:23,320
I'm so happy.

901
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:25,240
Ah!

902
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:26,380
Ah!

903
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,240
Ah!

904
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:29,880
Ah!

905
02:32:29,881 --> 02:32:30,881
Ah!

906
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:39,860
Ah!

907
02:32:39,861 --> 02:32:40,861
Ah!

908
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,960
Ah!

909
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:43,330
Ah!

910
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:43,780
Ah!

911
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:45,040
Ah!

912
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:47,000
What's this?

913
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:57,770
It feels so good.

914
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:24,170
Did you really do it? I'm sorry.

915
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:41,060
I'm sorry.

916
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:45,160
I'm sorry.

917
02:33:47,690 --> 02:33:51,880
Did you leave
already? I'm sorry.

918
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:53,900
I was in a bad mood.

919
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:56,840
I want to do it more.

920
02:33:57,440 --> 02:33:59,120
Do you want to do it more?

921
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:10,280
If you want to take a bath,
you have to take your butt out.

922
02:34:14,770 --> 02:34:15,770
You can't help it.

923
02:34:16,370 --> 02:34:17,610
Here we go.

924
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:25,970
How much do you have to take your butt out?

925
02:34:27,350 --> 02:34:28,430
I can't take it out at all.

926
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:43,670
It hurts!

927
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:52,670
I'm not fully back yet.

928
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:04,810
You have to speak properly, Sakuma.

929
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:23,680
I can't do it. I can't do it.

930
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:33,920
I can't do it. I can't do it.

931
02:35:35,225 --> 02:35:59,220
If you are hungry, you should eat properly.

932
02:35:59,221 --> 02:36:00,221
I'm going to take a bath.

933
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:01,840
Yes.

934
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:03,180
Be a good bath.

935
02:36:04,475 --> 02:36:05,560
Yes.

936
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:10,520
Yes.

937
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,520
I'm sorry.

938
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:35,780
It seems that the place where
I stay is not Ganysan Temple.

939
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:39,660
No, you don't have to come.

940
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:42,320
Go home and take a rest.

941
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,840
OK.

942
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:47,220
Well, I have a long meeting.

943
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:49,660
I'll go home when it's over.

944
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:51,240
See you.

945
02:36:51,620 --> 02:36:52,620
OK.

946
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:53,940
Good night.
