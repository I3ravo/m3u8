1
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:32,300
I met Hiroshi-san through
my friend's introduction.

2
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,770
We've been married for half a year.

3
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,940
He's always calm and kind.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,720
Our marital life is very fulfilling.

5
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,930
Are you going to take your boss, Abe-san?

6
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
No.

7
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,370
Today?

8
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,220
He rarely talks about work at home.

9
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,880
He's waiting for his boss to come home.

10
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,420
She is waiting for him to come back home.

11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,670
I'm sorry to bother you.

12
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,375
I'm home.

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Welcome back.

14
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,890
Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you. I'm Abe.

15
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,410
Nice to meet you, Abe.
My husband always helps me.

16
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,510
I'm sorry to bother you.

17
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,930
Not at all.

18
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,450
Please come in.

19
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:20,070
It's small, but please come in.

20
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,610
Thank you for coming.

21
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,910
It's a nice house.

22
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,670
I'm sorry, ma'am.

23
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,170
I asked you to come here all of a sudden.

24
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,650
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,490
I asked you all of a sudden,
so I could only make this much.

26
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,990
No, it's enough.

27
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,450
I'm really sorry.

28
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,230
But you have a nice
house, and a beautiful wife.

29
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,370
You have a good personality.

30
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,350
No, I don't.

31
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,990
You have a nice house,
but you are a little shy.

32
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,130
I think you are a little shy.

33
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,730
No, I'm not.

34
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,731
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,030
No, I didn't mean that.

36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,550
I heard you were coming all of a sudden.

37
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,230
I was drinking a little bit.

38
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,830
I usually drink a little more.

39
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,050
You should have told me earlier.

40
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,010
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:13,430
You wanted to show off, didn't you?

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,481
You wanted to get such a beautiful wife.

43
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:15,950
Is that so?

44
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,950
Well, just a little.

45
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,850
No, no, no.

46
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,510
You don't look like such a beautiful woman.

47
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,170
No, I don't.

48
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,790
At this level, I thought you
wanted to marry an ugly woman.

49
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,550
Then, what is this?

50
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,710
You are so hideous.

51
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,210
You are terrible.

52
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,030
At least, you should
have a little more bra.

53
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:41,050
I'm sorry, but I'm not a zombie.

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,961
I'm excited when a
beautiful woman does this.

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,481
My wife's meat is exquisite.

56
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,631
It's a little embarrassing.

57
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,130
I think it's exquisite.

58
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,830
I'm always happy.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,550
This is a masterpiece.

60
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,610
Please try it.

61
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,190
Please try it.

62
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,070
Here you are.

63
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,530
Thank you.

64
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,650
Let's eat.

65
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:15,345
I'm sure she'll love it.

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,750
Excuse me, sir.

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,030
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:24,710
I didn't notice.

69
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,610
No, no, no.

70
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,611
It's my job.

71
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,710
No, it's okay.

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Here you are.

73
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,730
Here you are.

74
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,291
I didn't want my wife to come with me.

75
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,770
Oh, I see.

76
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,410
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,950
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,590
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,290
Here you are.

80
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,250
Thank you.

81
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,950
Does your wife drink?

82
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,210
What?

83
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,050
Do you drink?

84
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,330
I drink occasionally.

85
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,070
Does your wife
drink? Yes, she does.

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,810


87
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,970
Give it to your wife.

88
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,030
Oh, I see.

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
You drink as it is.

90
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,690
As it is?

91
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:00,270
If you don't mind, I'd like to
have a cup of tea with you.

92
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,470
No, thank you.

93
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,490
You don't know how to joke.

94
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,730
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,240
It's good.

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
It's delicious.

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Bring me some chocolate.

98
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
OK.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,680
I'll bring it.

100
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,980
Please.

101
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,400
The food is delicious.

102
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,680
Thank you.

103
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,140
You must be hungry.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,800
No, I'm not.

105
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

106
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm sorry. I only had one.

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Oh, really?

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't worry about it.

109
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
Then, you drink it.

110
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Me? Yes, you.

111
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,860
Thank you.

112
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300


113
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
You're a good wife.

114
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,100
I'm a good wife.

115
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,960
Why did you like him?

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,820
He's surprisingly manly.

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,600
You're kidding,
right? He said so.

118
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm so happy.

119
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
Thank you.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600


121
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,500
You have to work hard at your company.

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,440
You got married to such a beautiful woman.

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll do my best.

124
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,016
You bought this with your own
money, didn't you? Yes, I did.

125
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,880
I overdid it a little.

126
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:09,881
You have to work hard.

127
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,980
Drink it.

128
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Thank you.

129
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,830
You too, Momo.

130
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Thank you.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,240
Kanetaka Shoji's Yoshida Senbu is also
a strong drinker, isn't he? Yes, he is.

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,500
You have to understand
that and invite him.

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I got it.

134
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
What's next?

135
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,140
He only drinks with both hands.

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Really?

137
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,800
Don't forget to set it up.

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I got it.

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
That's a lot.

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
Are you okay with the expenses?

141
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,740
I'll do something good.

142
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,680
Don't worry about finishing a big project.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
I got it.

144
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,180
I've just finished a big
job, so I'm a little relieved.

145
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm out of my mind.

146
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,910
Come on.

147
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,200
I guess I wanted to get excited
and introduce you to my wife.

149
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,380
Oh, that's what it
was about? Yeah.

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800


151
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,760
Aren't you drinking too
much? Oh, yeah, yeah.

152
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,710


153
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
Oh, really?

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,960
I'll be right back.

155
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,200
You bought a house in
such a nice place, didn't you?

156
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
You must be happy.

157
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
No, it's not like that.

158
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,560
I was introduced to this house by a friend.

159
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,940
Did you have such a friend?

160
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I don't think so at all.

161
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,340
I just happened to have
a junior from college.

162
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,080
Here you are.

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Thank you, Momo.

165
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Here you are.

166
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,950
Thank you.

167
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,540
Don't drink too much.

168
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,620
It's such a waste.

169
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,056
No, it's not a waste.
It's a thousand percent a waste.

170
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,380
No, it's not a waste.
It's a thousand percent a waste.

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,921
Would you like to
have a drink? Oh, sorry.

172
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,240
I didn't notice.

173
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
Here you are.

174
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,350
Thank you very much.

175
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,440
I finished my work a while
ago, so I want to drink with you.

176
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,780
I like the highball over there.

177
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I drank it in the car.

178
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,620
I was drinking with the director.

179
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,220
I always have dark eyes,
so you had the same thing.

180
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,140
Who has a red face? I'm mature.

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
Drink.

182
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,260
Hey, drink up.

183
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,261


184
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm sorry, but I can't drink anymore.

185
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,220
You only say what common
people say, don't you?

186
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,880
You're a stereotypical human being.

187
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,880
You're so mean, boss.

188
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
You're so mean.

189
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,440
You're so mean.

190
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:50,540
You're so mean.

191
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,360
You have to be able to argue with me.

192
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,776
You have to be able to argue with me.

193
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,076
You have to be able to argue with me.

194
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,320
I see.

195
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,080
I'll try harder.

196
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,800
But you always say, Mr. Abe, Mr. Abe.

197
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm just saying.

198
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,380
I know, right?

199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
It's embarrassing.

200
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,320
I can't help it.

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Here you are.

202
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,120
Thank you.

203
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,920
Are you OK? I'm OK.

204
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200


205
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,620
Drinking makes me stronger.

206
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,420
It's a way to improve my English.

207
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,800
Thank you.

208
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Make a lot of money.

209
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,660
Be careful.

210
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:29,080
It's so good.

211
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
Wow, it's so good.

212
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
You're getting more and more manly.

213
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Here, here.

214
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Thank you.

215
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,340
Wow, it's so good.

216
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,280
Wow, it's so good.

217
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,281
Here.

218
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,460
You're getting more and more manly.

219
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,660
I don't usually drink this much.

220
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,060
You're getting more and more manly.

221
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:54,460
Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine.

222
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020


223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And you!

224
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,360
Don't show your nipples!

225
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,580
Go home!

226
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,880
Didn't you wear a
shirt? I took it off.

227
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,700
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240


230
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,940
I didn't notice.

231
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,300
Are you OK? It's okay.

233
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,000
It's okay.

234
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
You can still drink more.

235
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,560
You can still drink more.

236
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm going. I'm going.

237
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,460
Oh, you're going to drink more?

238
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm going to follow you.

239
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,320
Abe-san, you're a strong drinker.

240
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,580
I'm a heavy drinker.

241
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm sorry, Abe-san.

242
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,180
He seems to have been drinking too much.

243
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
He was drinking as usual.

244
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,640
Besides, he hasn't been home lately.

245
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
That's true.

246
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,520
He's been working hard on his own project.

247
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,380
Is that so?

248
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,520
He must have run out of alcohol.

249
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,780
He doesn't talk to me much about work.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,620
I see.

251
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:27,280
Well, there are a lot of
people like that in the company.

252
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,880
Where did you get
married? What? Well, I.

253
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660


254
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,780
..

255
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,760
I'd like to know more about you.

256
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,660
I'm embarrassed.

257
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,820
You're sleeping, so it's okay.

258
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,240
I wonder if she still thinks of me.

259
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,240
Wow, it's so hot in here.

260
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,740
You're like a beauty and a beast.

261
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,560
No, I'm not.

262
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:04,700
No, I don't.

263
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,705
I don't know if I can
say this to my wife, who

264
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:13,400
seems to be happy to have
such a wonderful house.

265
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:27,280
I don't know if I should tell you
this, but I have something to tell you.

266
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
What is it?

267
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,460
In fact, I found out that Honda
has been neglecting the economy.

268
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Why?

269
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,520
I was surprised, too.

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,700
I didn't know such a serious and
carefree guy would do such a thing.

271
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,730
It's a little hard to believe.

272
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,660
Well, to be honest with you,
that's what I'm worried about.

273
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,920
However, as far as I can
tell, at least 2 million yen.

274
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,200
2 million yen? I have it.

275
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720


276
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,300
But why?

277
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,680
I don't know the details, but I'm sure...

278
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,180
It was October, wasn't it?

279
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,340
I wanted to make a good living for a
beautiful wife with a nice house and a loan.

280
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,060
Well, that's the first step for
a man who does business.

281
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,840
Fortunately, I'm the only
one who knows this fact.

282
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,320
Fortunately, I'm the only one in charge.

283
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,120
I haven't told my family yet.

284
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,520
There's a good chance
I'll have to pay more.

285
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,510
Abe-san, what should I do?

286
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,160
If my family finds out, it won't
just be a disciplinary action.

287
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,921
I'm sorry if I'm the
only one who thinks so.

288
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,490
Well, if you think about it
normally, it could be a criminal case.

289
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,200
Mr. Abe, is there anything we can do?

290
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,476
You don't want to
ruin the lives of two

291
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:43,350
people who seem to be
happy right now, do you?

292
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,100
Yes.

293
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,496
But the fact that you've
done it doesn't disappear.

294
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,238
I'm sorry, but if it's
about 2 million yen, I

295
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,980
can pay it off at my
disposal as the manager.

296
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Is that so?

297
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,970
You don't want to abandon him, do you?

298
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,690
Can I really do
that? You can do it.

299
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,960
At this stage.

300
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,270


301
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,720
But this time, even if you save him,

302
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,520
I have to stop him somewhere.

303
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
So,

304
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,380
I'll tell him,

305
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,100
I'll tell him not to do it again.

306
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,340
I'm really sorry.

307
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,040
It's not like you're apologizing.

308
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,640
I don't know what to do.

309
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Calm down, ma'am.

310
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,080
I'm the only one who knows this fact.

311
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,660
I'll save you two before it's too late.

312
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
I'll do anything I can.

313
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,120
Thank you.

314
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,080
I wanted to hear your resolve.

315
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,281
I wanted to ask you something.

316
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,520
Are you ready to do
anything to protect their lives?

317
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,160
Yes.

318
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:43,594
I'm glad you were loved
by such a beautiful lady, and

319
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:52,260
you said you would do anything
so as not to be found out.

320
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
What is it? Ma'am.

321
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520


322
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,790
Do you know anything about marital life?

323
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
What is it?

324
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:13,545
Don't you know?

325
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:18,121
If you come here in this
situation... My husband is sleeping.

326
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
What should I do? No, no.

327
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,740


328
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm sure you know.

329
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Please don't.

330
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,520
You said you'd do
anything to protect this life.

331
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,060
You said you would do
anything to protect me.

332
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,000
I did say that.

333
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,120
You know what I'm going to do, don't you?

334
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
No.

335
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I'm going to make sure you don't find
out about the crime you've committed.

336
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,400
It's too soon to say it's free, isn't it?

337
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,580
I said it's free.

338
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,960
So, are you going to pretend
you didn't hear anything? That's all.

339
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:09,420
I'm not just going to tell you that she's
a prostitute, and that she's a prostitute.

340
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,180
I'm going to tell you that she's a
prostitute, and that she's a prostitute.

341
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,940
That's all I'm going to tell you.

342
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,740
All right.
If you don't like it, I'll excuse you.

343
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,920
I beg you.

344
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,300
Please help me.

345
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,020
Then, let me help you.

346
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,801
No, that's... I'll tell you.

347
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,900
I don't think you're good at sex.

348
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:51,901
You don't have to sweat.

349
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,660
You sweat because your body doesn't rest.

350
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,500
You don't have to lose everything.

351
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,020
Give me your tongue.

352
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,700
Put your tongue out.

353
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,300
It's hard to do it next to her, isn't it?

354
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,880
Put your legs together.

355
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm going to puke.

356
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:46,501
I'm going to cry.

357
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,160
You just have to keep quiet.

358
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:15,460
You can do anything.

359
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
You can do anything.

360
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,140
You have a beautiful white skin.

361
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,290
Why are you so
nervous? I have a cramp.

362
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,080


363
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,720
You have a cramp,
don't you? I have a cramp.

364
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140


365
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,760
You have a beautiful pink cramp.

366
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Let me do it.

367
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,400
Are you sick?

369
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,940
I can't stand up because I'm excited.

370
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,640
Do you want to sit down?

371
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,910
You don't look like you're in a bad mood.

372
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,810
I can't stand your impatient face.

373
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,350
Let's go to bed.

374
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,351
Are you sleepy?

375
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,690
Your husband is sleeping next to you.

376
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,470
And you are playing with your body.

377
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm so embarrassed
that I'm going to hide it.

378
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,680
Please do it.

379
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:45,060
It's boring.

380
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm lucky to have such a face.

381
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,730
It's worth saving him.

382
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,880
Right?

383
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:14,490
I have a wound on my left leg.

384
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,170
I can see a wound here.

385
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,630
I have a wound on my left leg.

386
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,620
I can see a wound here.

387
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,861
I have a wound on my right leg.

388
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,410
She is still in a bad mood.

389
00:23:49,920 --> 00:24:12,780
She is still in a bad mood.

390
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,500
She has a finger in her mouth.

391
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,180
She is drooling.

392
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,370
You have a lot of pimples.

393
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:47,970
Can I take it
off? It's up to you.

394
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,390


395
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,990
If I tell you to take it
off, you should do it.

396
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,650
You are so stubborn.

397
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,710
Take it off.

398
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm going to take it off, too.

399
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,960
You're such a clumsy girl.

400
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,580
You want to protect him, don't you?

401
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,140
Can you do me a favor?

402
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,960
Can you do me a favor?

403
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,930
You know what to do, don't you?

404
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,710
What should I do?

405
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,510
Are you going to comfort
me with your hands?

406
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:29,511
Do you remember, ma'am?

407
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,030
Let's go around.

408
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
What should I do?

409
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Ma'am?

410
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Ma'am?

411
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,190
Don't be so serious.

412
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Deeper.

413
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,560
How is it compared to his?

414
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,360
He's small, isn't he?

415
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,200
I've seen him on a business trip.

416
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
It's like this.

417
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,260
You're not satisfied,
are you? No, I'm not.

418
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,220
It's written on your face.

419
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,720
Are you trying to be
a woman? No, I'm not.

420
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,200


421
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,120
I don't think so.

422
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,800
What do you mean?

423
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,460
I'm going to cut your nose.

424
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,240
I'm going to cut your nose.

425
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,500
I'm sorry.

426
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,750
You have beautiful hips.

427
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,140
You made a hole in my hip.

428
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,810
You have no balls.

430
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,650
You have a wife's tumor.

431
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,070
Ahh, it's so tight.

432
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
My wife… I feel sick.

433
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,030
I feel sick.

434
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,250
I can't do it.

435
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840


436
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,670
Ahh, it's so tight.

437
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,450
I feel sick.

438
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,110
My wife, I really feel sick.

439
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,150
What are you talking about?

440
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,450
I'm going to send you to hell.

441
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,160
I can't send you to
hell with that little girl.

442
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,980
Don't make me cry.

443
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,140
I'm going to cry.

444
00:33:40,880 --> 00:34:17,080
Don't be so hard on yourself.

445
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:32,720
I enjoyed the meal of 2 million yen.

446
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:13,710
It was a good one.

447
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,130
I'm going to break the egg.

448
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,500
I'm going to break the egg.

449
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,140
You like a big Chimpanzee, don't you?

450
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,860
You're used to it.

451
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,990
Do you mind here?

452
00:36:25,570 --> 00:37:35,230
Is my Chimpanzee so good?

453
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
No.

454
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,110
I've told you three times.

455
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,670
No.

456
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,210
Don't make such a loud voice.

457
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:47,960
Give me your hand.

458
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Huh?

459
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:28,830
Yes, that's right.

460
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,220
I'll do my best.

461
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,200
Don't make a loud voice.

462
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Oh, my wife.

463
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,460
Oh, you're naked.

464
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,610
Oh, you're naked.

465
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,061
I don't think you can get up here.

466
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,370
Oh, you feel good.

467
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,570
You have to keep your voice down.

468
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,980
My husband found out.

469
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Look.

470
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:54,980
Do you like me that
much? Wait a minute.

471
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,360


472
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,800
I think I can do it, too.

473
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:07,801
Wait a minute.

474
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:16,660
I can't do it.

475
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:25,340
You can't move like that.

476
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,340
You must have come out of a tightened hole.

477
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:28,341
It was stable,
wasn't it? Yes, it was.

478
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940


479
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,720
It's because you tighten
it, isn't it? No, it's not.

480
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,360


481
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,640
Please pull it out a little.

482
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,840
Please pull it out a little.

483
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:39,841
No, it's not.

484
00:42:45,690 --> 00:43:01,410
Because you tighten it,

485
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,370
I wanted to take it out.

486
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,950
It's terrible.

487
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,731
You wanted to have a
uterus, didn't you? No, it's not.

488
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,850


489
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,010
Honda's wife is such a good woman.

490
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,530
It's annoying.

491
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,210
Anyway, I'll come again.

492
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,470
I don't think I can tell Honda
what just happened here.

493
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,970
If I told him a little more,
he would understand.

494
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:46,910
I'll let you go.

495
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,650
I'll let you go.

496
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:49,651
I'll let you go.

497
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:53,090
So, my wife.

498
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,110
Again.

499
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,040
I need to take a bath.

500
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,540
I need to take a bath.

501
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,460
You look like you want to cry.

502
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,980
You said that to me many times
the other day, didn't you? No, I didn't.

503
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,040


504
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,320
You understood what I said, didn't you?

505
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,840
You are still so sensitive to my needs.

506
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,800
No, I'm not.

507
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:02,801
You are still crying.

508
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,720
Chikubi, you have grown up so much.

509
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
No, I haven't.

510
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,810
Your body is honest.

511
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,090
I was surprised.

512
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,380
Chikubi, you are about to leave.

513
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:46,990
I'm going to give you a massage.

514
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:47,991
Hey, wife.

515
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,190
I'm a man who is
dissatisfied with your desire.

516
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,430
I came to give you a massage.

517
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,360
You have a lot of wrinkles.

518
00:46:11,361 --> 00:46:31,120
I brought this because I can't be
satisfied with such a beautiful wife.

519
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,500
Please don't say bad things about her.

520
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,620
Don't do that, please.

521
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Don't do that.

522
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Look at your face.

523
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,341
If you say something like that,

524
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,520
I want to break your face even more.

525
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,881
Have you ever used such an
erotic woman? No, I haven't.

526
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,860
You're an adult.

527
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,790
Look.

528
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,836
That's why when you
get married to a boring

529
00:47:08,848 --> 00:47:11,590
man, you start to say
that your body is lonely.

530
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,700
It's fun, isn't it?

531
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,890
No!

532
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:34,380
Wait, Sumire-chan.

533
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,040
No?

534
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:48,380
What's the matter?

535
00:48:54,395 --> 00:48:55,916
You want me to comfort you, don't you?

536
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,840
Your back is trembling.

537
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,500
That's why I'm here.

538
00:49:09,565 --> 00:49:21,291
I don't know what to
do with such a beautiful

539
00:49:21,303 --> 00:49:32,780
and nasty face, and
it's all because of him.

540
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,140
You don't know anything about men, do you?

541
00:49:37,995 --> 00:49:39,460
You have such a big boob.

542
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,560
Your panties are wet.

543
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:56,510
You feel good, don't you?

544
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,390
Do you feel good?

545
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:27,990
Do you feel good
around here? Here? Here.

546
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:31,930


547
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,330


548
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,870
You don't have to make a loud voice today.

549
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:49,910
I want you to apply it directly to me.

550
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:50,500
I want you to apply it directly to me.

551
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:55,269
My wife, you have to do
what I tell you to do, or you

552
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:59,880
won't be able to go back
to the way you used to be.

553
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
Open your eyes wide.

554
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,160
Open your eyes wide.

555
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:09,700
Please don't look at me.

556
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,160
Please sit on my lap.

557
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,220
Go away.

558
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,260
Don't be stubborn.

559
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,340
I told you to go away.

560
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
You are a bad girl.

561
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,140
Don't do that!

562
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,680
No!

563
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,540
No!

564
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,190
Please don't come closer!

565
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,950
No!

566
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:12,950
No!

567
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,190
No!

568
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:24,230
Can you see it? It's so full of pus.

569
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:33,550
It's so full of pus that you can't feel it.

570
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,250
It's about to fall apart.

571
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:13,780
Nene, look!

572
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,240
I'm holding you.

573
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,820
You are scary.

574
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:39,510
He goes so fast.

575
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,511
He is so small.

576
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:55,860
He is not a human being.

577
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:28,140
He is so small.

578
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,700
Look at your tongue.

579
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,860
You have been coughing for a long time.

580
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,920
Show me your tongue.

581
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,140
You know that you want your
body, don't you? Telephone.

582
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,020


583
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,120
What's the timing?

584
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:14,280
Are you all right?

585
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,100
It's a call from a woman.

586
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,240
It's all right.

587
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:17,280
You'd better go out.

588
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
Please don't.

589
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,320
No.

590
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:19,940
Wait.

591
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,440
No.

592
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
Hello?

593
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,970
Is it going to be
late? It's all right.

594
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:39,410


595
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,810
If you don't take care of
yourself, you'll be exposed.

596
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:43,250
I'm sorry.

597
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,490
Welcome.

598
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:46,890
I'm not sick.

599
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,690
It's okay. It's okay.

600
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:58,590
I was cleaning up.

601
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,310
Okay. I'll wait for you.

602
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,560
Do your best at work.

603
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,240
You didn't find out, did you?

604
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:24,780
You didn't find
out? Please stop it.

605
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,360


606
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,140
She hasn't noticed it yet.

607
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,660
She is very sensible.

608
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,480
She usually notices
when I make such a noise.

609
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,960
Something is going on.

610
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,200
That's how she is.

611
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,240
She is very sensitive.

612
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,680
Look.

613
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Turn your back.

614
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,100
Turn your back.

615
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:51,280
Show me your face.

616
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,300
You are still eating.

617
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,960
You are so naughty.

618
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,120
Raise your leg.

619
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,080
Oh, you don't like it.

620
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:09,770
You are still eating.

621
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,920
You are so naughty.

622
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,800
You have a lot of pus.

623
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,300
Your anus is swollen.

624
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,800
You can't lie down.

625
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:34,820
You have a lot of pus.

626
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,220
You have a lot of pus.

627
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,970
You can lie down on your favorite place.

628
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,080
Mom is looking for氷.

629
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,450
The mother is looking for a peanut.

630
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:39,890
The mother is looking for a pear.

631
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:41,331
You have a lot of hair on your body.

632
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,250
You have a lot of hair.

633
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,521
You want me to comb
your hair more, don't you?

634
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,380
I'll do it for you.

635
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:06,190
I want you to comb your hair more.

636
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,830
Your nipples are so soft.

637
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,830
This is a good place, isn't it?

638
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:24,850
What are you doing?

639
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,390
The house in Shinjuku is wet
with your DOSUKEBEJYUU.

640
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:21,750
I'm sorry.

641
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,990
He doesn't feel the smell of
disgusting DOSUKEBEJYUU.

642
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,290
He is a bad Anpontan.

643
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,520
Don't cry.

644
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
Please let me off.

645
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:46,760
I've been through a lot.

646
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,650
I've had a hard time.

647
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,630
I'm getting old, too.

648
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,010
I'm getting older.

649
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:57,011
Will you take care
of me? I'm in trouble.

650
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:01,250
Please go.

651
01:04:01,615 --> 01:04:03,270


652
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:33,550
I washed the mangoes in the
salt water and they came out again.

653
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,470
They didn't come out?

654
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:37,471
What is it? Look.

655
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:39,650


656
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,510
You are getting used to it.

657
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,510
Do you want me to touch you?

658
01:04:56,511 --> 01:04:57,511
Do you want me to do it?

659
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,220
You do, don't you?

660
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,231
You didn't know that I
was such a gentle girl.

661
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:22,650
You are such a bad boy.

662
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:26,730
You are so useless.

663
01:05:26,731 --> 01:05:27,731
I'm sorry.

664
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:08,890
I told you before, didn't I?

665
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,450
You're the only one who feels good.

666
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:17,030
You have to understand
my feelings and forgive me.

667
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:20,450
Power balance.

668
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,381
You understand, don't
you? Give me a hug.

669
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:39,700
Let's continue.

670
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:56,540


671
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,520
Ouch!

672
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,990
Let me see your tongue.

673
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,200
Let me see your tongue.

674
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,840
Your tongue feels good, doesn't it?

675
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,180
My chest is sensitive, isn't it?

676
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,340
Please lick my chest.

677
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,100
Oh, it feels good.

678
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,520
It hurts.

679
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,860
You lick, roll, and suck.

680
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
More.

681
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,660
I can't stand it.

682
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:08,661
I'm sorry.

683
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,640
You can eat more gently.

684
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:43,431
Have you ever been pinched by her
chin with such a beautiful soft voice?

685
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,470
You have never been pinched.

686
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,470
I'm going to do a pie-fishing.

687
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:03,030
I'm going to pinch your boobs.

688
01:09:04,465 --> 01:09:06,426
I'm going to rub your
cheeks and make your boobs.

689
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,870
I'm going to put a vine on your boob.

690
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,070
Look at me.

691
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:16,170
Look at this.

692
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:20,530
It feels good, doesn't it?

693
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,130
Your tongue is playing.

694
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,130
I'll give you a treat.

695
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,800
Here you are.

696
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,420
Oh, it's hot.

697
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,480
I'm going to put the baby to sleep.

698
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:34,140
I'm going to put the baby to sleep.

699
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,860
I'm going to put the baby to sleep.

700
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:27,410
I'm sorry for my poor english.

701
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:36,970
I'm sorry for my poor english.

702
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,570
I'm sorry for my poor english.

703
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,555
This is the first time
I've ever had a baby,

704
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:17,990
so I'm a little nervous,
but I'll do my best.

705
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:33,828
Oh, my God, oh, my God

706
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:49,630
my God, oh, my God

707
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,110
※I have no idea what he is saying.

708
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,490
You feel lonely, don't you?

709
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:00,370
You also feel lonely.

710
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,020
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

711
01:13:36,021 --> 01:13:49,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

712
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,980
I'm sorry.

713
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:57,700
I don't want to eat it.

714
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,260
I don't want to eat it.

715
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

716
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,000
I'll give you a present.

717
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:39,700
I'm going to eat it all.

718
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:57,200
I'm going to eat it all.

719
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,120
I'm sorry.

720
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,526
I know you've been doing
this since you were little.

721
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,720
I'm so sorry.

722
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,880
I'm sorry.

723
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:10,970
I'm sorry.

724
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,210
I'm sorry.

725
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,570
Ughh~!

726
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:52,050
Just, look what I did to my mouth.

727
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:55,930
Ughh~! Oh, I'm sorry.

728
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

729
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:26,490
I'm sorry.

730
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:34,170
I'm sorry I'm the only
one who can't eat it.

731
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:44,910
I like it.

732
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:53,410
Today, I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

733
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:00,760
I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

734
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:00,840
I'm going to show you how to get rid
of the hair on the back of a cat's head.

735
01:18:00,841 --> 01:18:01,500
Oh!

736
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,720
Oh, you're so silly.

737
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,600
Oh!

738
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:09,630
Oh, don't be scared.

739
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,120
Oh!

740
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,720
Oh!

741
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Oh! Dad, I'm sorry.

742
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,920


743
01:18:42,535 --> 01:18:44,630
I'll put you in bed.

744
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,430
Please let me go.

745
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,170
You're so sentimental.

746
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:51,990
Please let me go.

747
01:18:51,991 --> 01:18:52,190
I'll put you in bed.

748
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:54,230
Please let me go.

749
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:58,190
I'll put my room smell on your bed.

750
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:59,230
No! Let me go.

751
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,410


752
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,370
Manko, you're lonely, aren't you?

753
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,910
Let's go to the bedroom.

754
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,480
Please.

755
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,560
Come on.

756
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:18,010
Let's do it here.

757
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:22,670
Wait a minute.

758
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,410
Don't be noisy.

759
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:26,411
Who the hell are you?

760
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,910
Hello? Yes, this is Abe.

761
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,550
What? You haven't received the order yet?

762
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,210
What? Are you in the hospital?

763
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:47,370
I'm terribly sorry.

764
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,490
I understand.
I'll send it to you right away.

765
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:53,350
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

766
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:54,170
Yes, yes.

767
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:55,730
Excuse me.

768
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,990
I'm sorry.

769
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,250
Excuse me.

770
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,190
Ma'am,

771
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,970
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

772
01:20:02,971 --> 01:20:03,971
See you later.

773
01:20:47,290 --> 01:21:02,170
What's wrong, Momo? You don't look well.

774
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,150
No, I'm fine.

775
01:21:06,151 --> 01:21:07,410
I see.

776
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,130
Oh, I know.

777
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:13,410
Why don't we go on a
trip to refresh ourselves?

778
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:16,411
We've had a lot of work lately.

779
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:19,830
Yeah, you're right.

780
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,310
I know. Where should we go?

781
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,390
How about Atami?

782
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,271
Now that I think about it,
I'm getting excited again.

783
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,480
I'm feeling better.

784
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:34,740
Let's do it again.

785
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,040
What? Ah, Momo, Momo.

786
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,830


787
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,610
Ah...

788
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,100
Ah...

789
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,680
Ah... Ah... Ah...

790
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,360
Ah, I feel so good in my throat.

791
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,941
Ah... Ah...

792
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:14,350
While she was with her husband,

793
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,730
she remembered her behavior with
Abe-san, which can be called humiliation.

794
01:22:18,731 --> 01:22:20,990
It reminds me of the
time when I was a child.

795
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:26,510
I shouldn't have done such a violent thing,

796
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:33,610
but I can't get that sex out of my head.

797
01:22:41,940 --> 01:23:14,640
Don't look at me like that.

798
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,510
You look very beautiful.

799
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:20,511
It looks good on you.

800
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,010
What is this?

801
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,980
You look so disgusting.

802
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,611
You don't have a high place
for him, do you? No, I don't.

803
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,750
I see.

804
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,290


805
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,950
It's not good to have sex in the morning.

806
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,141
You need to have the energy to do it.

807
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,941
Please let this be the last time.

808
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:50,510
It's up to the wife.

809
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,781
Don't you want to take a rest?

810
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,190
I'll do anything for you.

811
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:02,810
You want to protect our lives, don't you?

812
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,510
It's up to the wife.

813
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,370
You are not crying?

814
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:50,890
You are not crying?

815
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,390
He is so kind and gentle.

816
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:22,950
He is so kind and gentle.

817
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:36,230
She was licking her lips
and biting her lips lightly.

818
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,580
She was licking her
wife's breasts all the time.

819
01:26:11,865 --> 01:26:13,430
Please.

820
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:41,630
You've had a dream, haven't you?

821
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,090
There's no place like this.

822
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:07,770
You are a man who
can't satisfy a single wife.

823
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,050
I'm glad I was able to do something.

824
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,420
You look good.

825
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,620
Please stop.

826
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:25,621
Please lick me.

827
01:27:34,975 --> 01:27:36,890
You look like you want to be licked.

828
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,300
I want to be licked.

829
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,771
You look like you want to be licked.

830
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:50,810
No.

831
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,280
I'm sorry.

832
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:57,090
You don't have to lick me.

833
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,180
I'll lick you more.

834
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,530
Stand up.

835
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,130
Let's have fun.

836
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:15,250
You've never had sex in your life.

837
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,170
Stand up.

838
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,100
Come on.

839
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,140
Come to my mouth slowly.

840
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,871
You want me to lick
you, don't you? Come on.

841
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,020
Come on.

842
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,780
Come on.

843
01:29:59,781 --> 01:30:00,781


844
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:21,820
I'm not used to licking.

845
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,580
I'm not used to licking.

846
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:44,280
I'm not used to licking.

847
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:47,840
I'm going to give you a shot.

848
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,900
Take a deep breath.

849
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,160
This is a video of me eating a baby's food.

850
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:29,000
It's a video of me eating a baby's food.

851
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,000
I'm not good at eating.

852
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:35,001
I'm not good at eating.

853
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:18,420
Today, I'm going to show you how
to get rid of pimples on your face.

854
01:33:18,421 --> 01:33:19,140
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

855
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:21,246
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

856
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,176
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

857
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,640
I'm going to show you how to
get rid of pimples on your face.

858
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,340
You're so cute.

859
01:33:37,341 --> 01:33:38,341
It's delicious.

860
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:45,900
I pulled it out earlier,
but it's still like this.

861
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:52,790
You can't eat so much kimchi, can you?

862
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,230
a few shots

863
01:34:48,360 --> 01:35:05,513
Today, I'm going to
show you how to make the

864
01:35:05,525 --> 01:35:21,910
most delicious fried
chicken in the world.

865
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:26,450
Mew!

866
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:28,490
Mew!

867
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,910
Mew!

868
01:35:29,911 --> 01:35:30,911
Mew!

869
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,370
You are a good wife.

870
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:36,070
Mew!

871
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,740
You can't do a good job of petting.

872
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,140
Mew!

873
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,280
Mew!

874
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:51,741
You want a pet, don't you?

875
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:54,290
Mew!

876
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,291
It's written in the book.

877
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:03,650
You have to put up with it.

878
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:31,090
You can't stop crying,
can you? No, I can't.

879
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:35,290


880
01:36:41,615 --> 01:36:44,210
Oh, really?

881
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,840
Are you crying?

882
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,570
Yes.

883
01:37:13,095 --> 01:37:14,336
This video is an original copy.

884
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:19,830
The original version of this
video is not available for download.

885
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:23,490
・・・ arbitrarily

886
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:47,510
paper

887
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:54,210
※This video is a derivative
work of the Touhou Project.

888
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:00,570
It's the middle of the night.

889
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,080
What is it?

890
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:18,851
You don't have to be so aggressive.

891
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:29,530
Now...

892
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:32,530
You're fine. Don't be so aggressive.

893
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:35,910
I'm tired.

894
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,270
You don't have to be.

895
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:40,271
It's a lie, isn't it?

896
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:56,480
The fact that Honda
made an error is all a lie.

897
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:00,560
There's no way he made an error.

898
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,800
You're saying he lied?

899
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:06,860
Yes.

900
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,700
You're the worst!

901
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:10,880
I want to hit you.

902
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:15,540
But your body reacts to it.

903
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,340
Stop it.

904
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:16,980
What are you going to do?

905
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,100
No.

906
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,720
What are you going to do?

907
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,781
You have a lot of bruises.

908
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,760
What are you going to do?

909
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:29,540
What are you going to do?

910
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,120
You have a lot of bruises.

911
01:40:33,121 --> 01:40:46,550
You are a human being,
but you are so full of blood.

912
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:55,690
You lost to my Chimpanzee, not to a lie.

913
01:40:57,230 --> 01:40:59,850
Do you want to quit?

914
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,840
You don't want me to quit, do you?

915
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:08,740
I'm not asking you. Do you want to quit?

916
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:18,420
Do you want to quit?

917
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,480
Do you want to quit?

918
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:21,680
Do you want to quit this?

919
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,230
How many times have you made me live?

920
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:32,040
I want to know the truth.

921
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,900
Don't think about him now.

922
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:43,280
Tell me what you want
to do in this situation.

923
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,070
Please continue.

924
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:54,900
Help me.

925
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:04,010
What?

926
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:14,380
Please, put me in the coffin.

927
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:36,700
I lied to you because I thought
I couldn't satisfy a good woman.

928
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,760
You were like that.

929
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,760
I'm sorry.

930
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:26,060
Oh, my God!

931
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:35,620
You can't kill him by stabbing him.

932
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:46,150
You can't kill him by stabbing him.

933
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,470
Oh, my God!

934
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:18,650
I can't stop it.

935
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,180
My life...

936
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:39,020
My life...

937
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:41,780
It feels good, doesn't it?

938
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,360
It smells good, doesn't it?

939
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,480
I'm going to give you a hand.

940
01:45:39,700 --> 01:46:04,930
I'm going to give you a hand.

941
01:46:04,931 --> 01:46:04,970
I'm going to give you a hand.

942
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:06,010
Come on.

943
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:39,890
I'm sorry.

944
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:55,180
I'm sorry.

945
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:09,510
I'm sorry.

946
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:11,550
I'm sorry.

947
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,640
I want to cry.

948
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:10,080
I want to cry even more.

949
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:13,100
I want to cry.

950
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:18,800
Please, let me cry a little more.

951
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Please! I'm sorry.

952
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:31,510
I have a horse.

953
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:58,790


954
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:57,560
I'll give you a little more.

955
01:49:57,561 --> 01:49:58,860
I'll give you some rice.

956
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:06,570
I'm sorry.

957
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:08,690
I'm sorry.

958
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:11,240
Come here.

959
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,650
Come here.

960
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:14,690
I'm sorry.

961
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,010
You are better than him.

962
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,270
Of course.

963
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,630
Ah----

964
01:51:30,680 --> 01:52:12,540
Ah… Oh, no, no, no, no...

965
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:27,260
Ugh… Oh, no…

966
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:29,640
Oh, no…

967
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,721
I've got a problem
when I'm told to be quiet.

968
01:52:39,905 --> 01:52:41,410
Oh, no…!

969
01:52:41,411 --> 01:52:45,670
This is terrible…
I'm going to break.

970
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:47,650
I'm so happy.

971
01:54:52,180 --> 01:55:01,580
I'm glad you are in the toilet.

972
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:53,840
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

973
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,560
I'm sorry.

974
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:05,650
She is so impolite.

975
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:38,160
I'm sorry.

976
01:57:38,161 --> 01:57:38,360
I'm so sorry.

977
01:57:38,361 --> 01:57:39,361
I'm tired.

978
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:32,400
You can't have sex for such a long time.

979
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:38,880
What is this?

980
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,170
It's a box, isn't it?

981
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:40,660
Come in and sit in the box.

982
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:43,280
Come in the box.

983
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,040
I'm sorry.

984
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,160
I'm sorry.

985
02:00:26,161 --> 02:00:27,161
I'll tighten your leg.

986
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,160
I'm sorry.

987
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:52,010
I'm sorry.

988
02:00:52,011 --> 02:00:57,200
Please lie down.

989
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,300
Don't stop.

990
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:41,310
I love you.

991
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:44,430
I love this cat.

992
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:55,530
I love you, too.

993
02:01:56,530 --> 02:01:57,530
I love you.

994
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,570
I'm sleepy.

995
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:03,571
I'm scared.

996
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:07,980
I'm scared.

997
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:20,180
I can't drown.

998
02:02:23,090 --> 02:03:13,930
I can't stand it anymore.

999
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:25,270
You like this, don't you?

1000
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:28,290
Oh, please help me more.

1001
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:13,030
Mom, I can't do it anymore.

1002
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:28,860
I can't do it anymore.

1003
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:30,660
You can do it longer.

1004
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,610
You can do it longer.

1005
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:46,890
You can do it longer.

1006
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:55,590
I can't do it.

1007
02:04:59,890 --> 02:05:02,450
My waist is broken.

1008
02:05:05,890 --> 02:05:06,890
I can't do it.

1009
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:09,350
I can't do it.

1010
02:05:09,351 --> 02:05:10,351
I can't do it.

1011
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,970
I can't do it.

1012
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:38,760
I can't do it.

1013
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:52,350
I'm going to sleep.

1014
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:04,710
Good night.

1015
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:09,741
You are sleeping, aren't you?

1016
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:11,730
My favorite baby.

1017
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:31,590
Oh, no!

1018
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:33,090
What should I do?

1019
02:07:40,385 --> 02:07:43,120
Oh, no!

1020
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:45,350
Watch out! Please help me.

1021
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:08,460


1022
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:42,760
Mother, I'm sorry.

1023
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:54,500
I'm sorry, mother! Mother.

1024
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:05,410
..

1025
02:09:05,411 --> 02:09:06,670
What can I do? I lost.

1026
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,320


1027
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:03,750
You are the best woman.

1028
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:09,670
It's the best sex.

1029
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:15,640
You don't have to worry about it.

1030
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:16,641
It's a big deal.

1031
02:10:18,875 --> 02:10:21,360
Let's continue this relationship.
