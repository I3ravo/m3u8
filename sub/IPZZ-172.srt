1
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,730
Ah, haha.

2
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,740
Ahaha.

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,380
I just finished the shooting.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm sitting on the massage
chair because I'm so tired.

5
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:41,470
Today, at first, there was no
iPhone, and I was bullied a lot on

6
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:51,460
the ground, so I was very anxious,
but the result was a lot of fun.

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
What was the most fun?

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:05,600
It was a lot of fun when a
man came in with a blindfold on.

9
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,940
I laughed a lot and bullied a lot.

10
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,720
Do you have any regrets?

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,700
All.

12
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:26,620
I had a lot of fun, so please cry a lot.

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Thank you.

14
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,010
Are you ready?

15
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,650
Yes.

16
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,930
Are you okay?

17
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,270
Are you used to shooting?

18
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,770
No, I'm not.

19
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,130
You'll be back soon, right?

20
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,190
Yes.

21
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,390
Today, as I told you before,

22
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,690
I'll do my best.

23
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,190
What's wrong?

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,570
What's your reaction?

25
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,970
I'm looking forward to it.

26
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:20,971
Really?

27
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,570
I'm sorry, but I have to
postpone my schedule for a day.

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,790
Okay.

29
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,590
I'll talk to you on the way.

30
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,790
Okay.

31
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,490
This time, I'm going to do it for 24 hours.

32
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,870
I'm going to introduce you to a lot
of people who can say nice things.

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,630
You?

34
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,770
Yes.

35
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,210
I hope you can play with me a lot.

36
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,090
By the way, how many
times do you do it a day?

37
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,670
How many times?

38
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,130
Maybe 10 times?

39
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,630
10 times?

40
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,730
I don't think so.

41
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,590
10 times?

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,710
I don't think so at all.

43
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,790
7 or 8 times.

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,830
That's amazing.

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,860
You are strong.

46
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,910
Maybe.

47
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,830
Maybe?

48
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:17,030
No, I'm not.

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,730
I think this is the last time we meet.

50
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,050
Are you going to quit?

51
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,450
No, I'm not.

52
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,046
I'll see you again tomorrow morning.

53
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,970
OK?

54
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,050
This is the entrance of this hotel.

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,450
It's sparkling.

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,690
Yes, it's sparkling.

57
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,390
Have a good day.

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Room 603.

59
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,470
Here?

60
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,690
Yes.

61
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,730
Are you alone?

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm just asking.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,610
I'll enjoy it.

64
00:04:57,460 --> 00:06:05,780
Excuse me.

65
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,630
Hello.

66
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,900
Nice to meet you.

67
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,120
Nice to meet you, too.

68
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,300
I'm Karen.

69
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm Otoyo.

70
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,600
Nice to meet you.

71
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,980
Can I sit here?

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,100
It's so beautiful.

73
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,340
I'm a little nervous.

74
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,780
Can I sit here?

75
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,180
Yes, you can.

76
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Really?

77
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,220
Thank you.

78
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,340
I'm a little nervous.

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,260
Are you?

80
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:46,920
Yes.

81
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,020
Thank you.

82
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,360
I get nervous.

83
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,860
You have a lot of cameras.

84
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,840
That's right.

85
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,480
But I don't have anyone
else, so I can relax.

86
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,520
You don't look so nervous.

87
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm very nervous.

88
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,340
You're lying!

89
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
I'm serious.

90
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,260
It's hard.

91
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,620
It's hard, isn't it?

92
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,120
Are you nervous?

93
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,280
No, I'm not.

94
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,800
Everything is beautiful.

95
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,460
Did you play the piano?

96
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
No, I didn't.

97
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
You didn't?

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Your hands are cute.

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Your eyes are short.

100
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,020
It's cute.

101
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
My hands are shaking.

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Are you sweating?

103
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm nervous.

104
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,680
Your fingers are long.

105
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:13,090
Can I drink this?

106
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,710
You already drank it.

107
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,711
Oh, I drank it.

108
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,970
Is it okay?

109
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,910
Let's eat.

110
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,880
It's good.

111
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
It's like a dog.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,840
Why does it look like a dog?

113
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
It's cute.

114
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,700
It looks like a small animal.

115
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,140
It's soothing.

116
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,200
It's soothing?

117
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
It's on my lips.

118
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh, yeah.

119
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:59,960
What do you want to do today?

120
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
What do you want to do?

121
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,980
I have a sensitive body.

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Really?

123
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,380
I don't think you have a sensitive image.

124
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
I have a sensitive image.

125
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,200
I want you to make it a lot tighter.

126
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Tighter?

127
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,840
Like riding on it.

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Do you like it?

129
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,360
I like it a lot.

130
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,600
Is it sensitive?

131
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
It's pretty sensitive.

132
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,580
Is it fun?

133
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,120
It's hard.

134
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
It's hard.

135
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,590
Do you know what I mean?

136
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,020
It tickles.

137
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,420
What should I do?

138
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,840
Do you want me to kick you?

139
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
No.

140
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,800
Do you want me to take a
shower and go up the stairs?

141
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,980
What do you want me to do?

142
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,560
Do you want me to sleep?

143
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,420
I'm a little embarrassed.

144
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,200
Are you sweating?

145
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm sweating a little.

146
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
You're sweating.

147
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,460
I'm a little embarrassed.

148
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Open your eyes.

149
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm a little embarrassed.

150
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
You're sweating.

151
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,090
It feels good.

152
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,410
Open your eyes.

153
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,190
I think I should keep my head down.

154
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,650
You're still a baby, aren't you?

155
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,710
Yes.

156
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,290
You look like you're in pain.

157
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,760
Does it hurt?

158
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
It hurts.

159
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,760
I can't get out.

160
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,820
Get out quickly.

161
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,070
Do you want to wear it?

162
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,690
No, I don't want to wear it.

163
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:54,980
Oh, you look great!

164
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Why are you hiding it?

165
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,110
It's a little embarrassing.

166
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Let me see.

167
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,970
You look great!

168
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,780
What is this?

169
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:23,260
This is also...
Oh, it's spinning.

170
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,280
Is this taken?

171
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Yes.

172
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,380
Oh, it's true.

173
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,180
It's difficult.

174
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Difficult?

175
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,100
Look, I can't see it.

176
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,540
It's open.

177
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
I can see it.

178
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,100
It's difficult.

179
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,740
I'm going to cry.

180
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,680
I'm going to cry.

181
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:12,801
This is really embarrassing.

182
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,360
Are you ready?

183
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
This is embarrassing.

184
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm going to cry.

185
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:58,270
I'm going to cry.

186
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,100
I'm going to cry.

187
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:15,101
I can't do it anymore.

188
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Really?

189
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,190
I can see the juice.

190
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,710
I can see the juice.

191
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,110
It's embarrassing.

192
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,320
I can't do it anymore.

193
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,520
It's very hard.

194
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,830
I don't want to do it anymore.

195
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,470
Hurry up.

196
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,750
No, I can't.

197
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,930
Don't you want to do something more erotic?

198
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,970
No, I don't.

199
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,770
I want to see my boyfriend.

200
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,710
What?

201
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,950
I want to see my boyfriend.

202
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,890
Your boyfriend?

203
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,050
Yes.

204
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,810
Then, take it off.

205
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,370
Yes.

206
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,670
Can I do it with this?

207
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,380
This is the first time for me to do this.

208
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,710
You are so thin.

209
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
How do I look?

210
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,600
You are so cute.

211
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,060
How do I look?

212
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,140
You are so cute.

213
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:31,980
I want to sleep.

214
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
It's so cute.

215
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,270
It's so thin.

216
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
Is your abs broken?

217
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,010
It's amazing.

218
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,850
Can I touch it?

219
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,330
It's hard.

220
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,450
Is it hard?

221
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,730
My abs are hard.

222
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,590
I thought it was soft.

223
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,790
It's so soft.

224
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Can I touch it?

225
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Yes.

226
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:38,980
It's moving.

227
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
It's like a cow's boob.

228
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:55,130
It's so beautiful.

229
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,630
It's amazing.

230
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,250
I love this blood vessel.

231
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:32,010
Do you like this?

232
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,850
Yes.

233
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,330
I do make-up.

234
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:48,110
Do you want me to do it?

235
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,150
Do you want me to do it?

236
00:20:50,500 --> 00:21:07,900
What do you want me to do?

237
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,460
Do you want me to pat your head?

238
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:37,620
Do you want me to do something?

239
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
That's enough.

240
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Do you want more?

241
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,380
Hey, I said that's enough.

242
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
That's enough.

243
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:13,200
I can't take this anymore!

244
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:14,201
I can't breathe.

245
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,550
I can't breathe.

246
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,970
I can't breathe.

247
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,990
I can't breathe.

248
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,870
Do you want me to help you?

249
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:49,770
Are you okay?

250
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,710
How do you feel?

251
00:26:41,580 --> 00:27:10,990
It's so good.

252
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,520
Can I touch you?

253
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,430
I want to touch you.

254
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,350
It's so beautiful.

255
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:24,500
Where are you from?

256
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,540
You're crying a lot.

257
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,490
You're cute.

258
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,360
Show me.

259
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,930
I'm nervous because I can't touch you.

260
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,130
Can I be close to you?

261
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:02,210
I'm sorry.

262
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,610
It's embarrassing.

263
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,870
I'm so embarrassed.

264
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,430
I can't put it on.

265
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,130
Put it on.

266
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,060
I feel embarrassed.

267
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,910
Put it on properly.

268
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,450
Did you see that?

269
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,630
Yes, I did.

270
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:02,210
I'm so happy.

271
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,670
I can see your eyes.

272
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,990
Look at me again.

273
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,950
Look at me.

274
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,770
Look at me.

275
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm sorry.

276
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
I'm sorry.

277
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,980
I'm sorry.

278
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,780
Can you see me breathing?

279
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,750
I'm sorry.

280
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,570
I'm sorry.

281
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:11,535
I can't.

282
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:21,000
What should I do?

283
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,050
It was a scar.

284
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,160
Are you awake?

285
00:34:42,360 --> 00:35:03,700
Hang in there.

286
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:35,010
Are you awake?

287
00:35:35,590 --> 00:36:45,630
Does it feel good?

288
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:50,150
It hurts.

289
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,210
Why?

290
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,760
It hurts.

291
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,280
You can do it.

292
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,770
You can do it.

293
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,141
You don't have to do it one more time.

294
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,810
Can I do it one more time?

295
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,050
You can do it.

296
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:25,070
Let me help you.

297
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,070
I'm going to take off my clothes.

298
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I'm going to eat.

299
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
I'm going to eat.

300
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,020
I'm still full.

301
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,880
Do you want to eat this?

302
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,420
I'm going to eat.

303
00:43:48,775 --> 00:44:01,570
Don't get up.

304
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,330
I'm sorry.

305
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,650
You stood up.

306
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,370
You have an awkward posture.

307
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
I can't stand it anymore.

308
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,410
It was hard, wasn't it?

309
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,210
Yes, it was.

310
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,741
I couldn't stand it at all.

311
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,940
Ruri-chan.

312
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,100
Kako-chan is touching me.

313
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,740
Ruri-chan, don't you touch me?

314
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,780
No, I'm not.

315
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,160
No, no.

316
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:16,400
It's like this, right?

317
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,080
Like this?

318
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,580
Yes.

319
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Do you know how to do it?

320
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:21,780
What?

321
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,900
I don't know how to do it.

322
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
I'm embarrassed.

323
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
What is it?

324
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,440
I don't know.

325
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,020
I see.

326
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
I'm sorry.

327
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,370
I'm sorry.

328
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,470
I'm sorry.

329
00:45:59,290 --> 00:45:59,850
I'm sorry.

330
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,270
I'm sorry.

331
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,470
It's hot.

332
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,350
I'm sweating a lot.

333
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:27,900
Open your eyes.

334
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:32,320
Open your eyes.

335
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:47,600
It's hot, isn't it?

336
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:48,601
I'm sorry.

337
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,650
It's better now.

338
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,410
It feels good.

339
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,910
Did you feel warm?

340
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,010
It feels good.

341
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,470
It feels good.

342
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,460
I felt the same way.

343
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,820
It feels good.

344
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,870
It feels good.

345
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,690
It feels good.

346
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,790
Oh, I see.

347
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,870
OK.

348
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,610
This way.

349
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,020
My sweet kiss.

350
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,350
What?

351
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,060
Do you want to kiss me?

352
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,800
Do you want to kiss me?

353
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:44,910
Can I kiss you?

354
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,840
You want to kiss me, right?

355
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,160
Yes.

356
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
I want to kiss you.

357
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,690
I've never seen a place like this.

358
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,730
It's great.

359
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,190
It's like a place for
people who take a bath.

360
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,190
You can do it anywhere.

361
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,610
Anywhere?

362
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,170
You can do it anywhere.

363
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,310
It's a little bit ticklish.

364
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,030
It's ticklish.

365
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,790
It's ticklish.

366
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:15,070
I'm going to try it.

367
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,450
Okay.

368
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:23,480
Is it okay?

369
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,970
Oh, it's so hard.

370
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,110
It's so hard.

371
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,120
I can't do it anymore.

372
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,850
I can't do it anymore.

373
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,470
I can't do it anymore.

374
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:58,500
I can't do it anymore.

375
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,340
I can't do it anymore.

376
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
I can't do it anymore.

377
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,700
I can't do it anymore.

378
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,040
I can't do it anymore.

379
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:11,410
I can't do it anymore.

380
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,150
I can't do it anymore.

381
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,210
I can't do it anymore.

382
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,350
I can't do it anymore.

383
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,150
I can't do it anymore.

384
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,210
I can't do it anymore.

385
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:28,060
Okay, let's do it again.

386
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:28,480
I'm sorry.

387
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
I'm sorry.

388
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,280
I'm sorry.

389
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,020
I'm sorry.

390
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:33,021
It's no problem.

391
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,360
It's no problem.

392
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,116
Don't you feel like you can still do it?

393
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,220
I can.

394
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,700
Let me see your hand.

395
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,440
You can't see my hand?

396
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,020
I'll do it again.

397
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,160
Okay.

398
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:48,161
It's so difficult.

399
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,820
Congratulations.

400
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,220
You confessed your love to me.

401
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,480
I love you.

402
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,840
I love you, too.

403
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,480
I love you, too.

404
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:08,220
Thank you very much.

405
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,520
I love you.

406
00:52:11,521 --> 00:52:13,440
It's already 5 o'clock.

407
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,840
Can I laugh now?

408
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,700
Yes, you can.

409
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Are you tired?

410
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,060
No, I'm not.

411
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,820
My body hurts.

412
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,980
Hello.

413
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
Hello.

414
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Hello.

415
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,960
Are you really alone?

416
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,620
Yes.

417
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,900
Welcome.

418
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,360
You are so cute.

419
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,840
You are so cute.

420
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,840
Nice to meet you.

421
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
Nice to meet you.

422
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,780
What's your name?

423
00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:27,781
My name is Jin.

424
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,060
Nice to meet you.

425
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,440
Nice to meet you, too.

426
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,320
Can I sit next to you?

427
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,140
I'm so happy.

428
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,480
Two people.

429
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,380
Are you going to do it today?

430
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Which one?

431
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,980
Three?

432
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,640
Which one?

433
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,600
Which one?

434
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,840
I'm sorry.

435
00:53:56,841 --> 00:53:57,841
What?

436
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,340
I'm doing it.

437
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
You are so erotic.

438
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,220
I'm sorry.

439
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,420
I'm sorry.

440
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,960
You are so cute.

441
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,300
Really?

442
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,560
Yes.

443
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,320
You are wearing sexy clothes.

444
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,000
Your legs are beautiful.

445
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,000
You are looking at me.

446
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,260
You were looking at me.

447
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,740
I was looking at you.

448
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,220
Excuse me.

449
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:35,980
You are so cute.

450
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,920
I talked to my friend recently.

451
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:41,760
Really?

452
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,560
She said you are so cute.

453
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,120
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

454
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,240
It's true.

455
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
You are amazing.

456
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:01,120
I didn't think I'd meet you.

457
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,150
How long have you been alone?

458
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,150
I've been alone since noon.

459
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,330
Since noon?

460
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:15,470
Yes.

461
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,151
So you've been alone for a while.

462
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,690
Maybe.

463
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,930
I've been alone since noon, so I'm bored.

464
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:25,931
I think that's it.

465
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:30,450
I just... I just made a mistake.

466
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:37,390
I want to go outside.

467
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:37,830
Outside?

468
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,090
Yes.

469
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,350
Where do you want to go?

470
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,230
Somewhere.

471
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,790
I want to go shopping.

472
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,030
Shopping?

473
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,330
Yes.

474
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,430
Just the two of us?

475
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,610
Are you sure?

476
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:57,630
I don't have money, so I
want you to buy me something.

477
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:58,890
I don't have money at all.

478
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,010
Are you sure?

479
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,970
If you buy me something, I'll
treat you to kimchi fried rice.

480
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,390
I'll buy you anything.

481
00:56:12,935 --> 00:56:13,935
Really?

482
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,830
I'll buy you anything.

483
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,940
I'll buy you anything.

484
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,120
I'll buy you something very expensive.

485
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:22,401
You look like you're having fun.

486
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:24,910
I want some sweets.

487
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,340
Sweets?

488
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:28,300
Let's go.

489
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,660
Let's go.

490
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,520
Isn't the bag big?

491
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,880
The bag is big.

492
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,360
We're here.

493
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,560
I'm happy.

494
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:48,650
It smells good.

495
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,630
I don't like it.

496
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,690
I'm so happy.

497
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,400
The weather is good.

498
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:57,790
The weather is good.

499
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,730
Wait a minute.

500
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,310
Do you want me to push it?

501
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,570
Yay!

502
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,790
I'm so happy.

503
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,030
She is so cute.

504
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,401
She is smiling all the time.

505
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,570
I don't want to be suspicious in the store.

506
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,350
I'm too nervous.

507
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,811
It's so quiet in the hotel.

508
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,870
There are a lot of people.

509
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,490
I want to go with Karen.

510
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,010
I want to go with you.

511
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,410
Please be careful of the car.

512
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:41,050
I'll protect you.

513
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,370
I'll help you.

514
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,150
I'm happy.

515
00:57:44,151 --> 00:57:47,290
You can buy anything with this.

516
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,270
I'll buy it.

517
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,370
Is it good?

518
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,010
I don't know how it tastes.

519
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
Let's eat.

520
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,150
Why are you looking at me?

521
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:11,410
I think you are so cute.

522
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,030
Be careful.

523
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,750
It's like a dream.

524
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,750
I will do better things from now on.

525
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,030
I'm a fan of you.

526
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,370
Are you going home?

527
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,450
Yes, I'm going home.

528
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,310
Yes, I'm going home.

529
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,350
Thank you.

530
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,590
I'm glad.

531
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,210
How is it?

532
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,730
I want to do something.

533
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,100
You are moving a lot.

534
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Uh-huh.

535
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,140
It's like saltiness.

536
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,460
Uh-huh.

537
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,710
I knew it.

538
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:48,810
I'm glad it's not soaked.

539
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,280
I'm glad it's not soaked.

540
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000

Ah.

543
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:12,620
It's a little big.

544
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Is it?

545
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,680
Yes.

546
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,000
It smells a little.

547
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:20,800
Why?

548
01:01:20,801 --> 01:01:20,900
What?

549
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,321
Something sweet and
sour came out of your mouth.

550
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,960
It came out.

551
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,460
I'm so happy.

552
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,480
It's hard.

553
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
I'll do it.

554
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,620
Can I?

555
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,560
Yes.

556
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:56,561
Oh!

557
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,100
Eh?

558
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Oh!

559
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,340
It feels so good!

560
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,180

566
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:40,670
Don't frown!

567
01:02:40,671 --> 01:02:41,110
Don't bite me!

568
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,490
I'll bite you!

569
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:52,600
It feels so good It feels so good

570
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,420
That's not good.

01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:32,180
It feels good.

576
01:04:52,030 --> 01:05:01,950
Sonya drinking hot water I was trying
to show my love to her, and I failed.

577
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,250
I was trying to show my love
to my daughter, and I missed it.

578
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:03,251
It's amazing.

You can't do that.

583
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,080
You can't do that either.

584
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:12,680
It feels so good.

585
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,010

598
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,461

01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,100

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,880
Why are you going?

601
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,395
Because it feels so good.

602
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,240
Over there.

603
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:53,880
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

604
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,300

616
01:08:51,881 --> 01:08:52,881
Are you okay?

617
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,120
I'm in trouble.

618
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,140

Let me lick your hand.

623
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,890
I don't know what to do with myself.

624
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:47,980
I don't know what to do with myself.

625
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,422
I don't know what to do with myself.

626
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,660
I don't know what to do with myself.

627
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:54,101
I don't know what to do with myself.

628
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,340
I don't know what to do with myself.

629
01:16:55,341 --> 01:16:56,180
I don't know what to do with myself.

630
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,761
I don't know what to do with myself.

631
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,856
I don't know what to do with myself.

632
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,480
I don't know what to do with myself.

633
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:01,921
I don't know what to do with myself.

634
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:04,060
I don't know what to do with myself.

635
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:04,380
I don't know what to do with myself.

636
01:17:04,381 --> 01:17:05,580
I'm sorry.

637
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:17,490
You are so cute.

638
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:23,011
You didn't notice I was peeing next to you?

639
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:26,200
I didn't know you were peeing.

640
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,560
You don't get up at all.

641
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,781
You are standing up a lot.

642
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,800
She is leaning on my shoulder.

643
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,780
Is she sleeping?

644
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,830
She is playing with my hand.

645
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,460
It feels good.

646
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:55,860
He is also cute when he is in a good mood.

647
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,260
Ah!

648
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,020
Ah!

649
01:19:16,021 --> 01:19:17,021
It's gross.

650
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,300
Is it good?

651
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,700
It's gross.

652
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:49,070
You are so kind.

653
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,700

657
01:20:40,880 --> 01:21:40,130
I like it so much.

658
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,060
Do you want me to put it on your face?

659
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,080
Do you want me to put it on your face?

660
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,700
Do you want me to put it on your face?

661
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,080
Put it on my face.

662
01:22:45,940 --> 01:23:06,880
Oh, it feels good.

663
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,170
Oh, it's going straight.

664
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:26,370
What's going on?

665
01:23:26,371 --> 01:23:27,371
What?

666
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:36,300
It's hot.

667
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,320
Can I go?

668
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,420
Can I go?

669
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,720
I'm about to puke.

670
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,430
No, you can't.

671
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:19,080
It feels good.

672
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,380
I'm about to puke.

673
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,950
Oh no, I can't stand it anymore.

674
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,490
I can't do it yet.

675
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,661
I want to spit out my boyfriend's mouth.

676
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,290
Are you ready?

677
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,270
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going.

678
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:08,310
I'm sorry.

679
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:09,311
One more time.

680
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:22,210
I didn't say yes.

681
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,870
I'm sorry.

682
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:27,890
I'm sorry.

683
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,190
Thank you.

684
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,630
I'm glad you like it.

685
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,780
Was it good?

686
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:42,130
How is it?

687
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:43,890
Is it bitter?

688
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:46,760
Bitter?

689
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:51,480
It's your own, isn't it?

690
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,660
Oh, it feels so good.

691
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:16,870
Wait, your body is so stiff.

692
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,120
Can you go back to sleep?

693
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,240
I think I can go back to sleep.

694
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,070
Oh, it's long.

695
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,540
It feels so good.

696
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:25,810

Does it feel good?

871
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:20,520
Yes.

872
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,780
Oh, no, no, no.

873
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:15,270
Oh, no, no.

874
01:50:15,271 --> 01:50:16,271
It's going to be a mess.

875
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:18,030
It's going to be a mess.

876
01:50:18,031 --> 01:50:19,031
It's going to be a mess.

877
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:25,380
Can I touch you?

878
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,040
You have a great smile.

879
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:31,600
Yes.

880
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:36,110
Can I kiss you?

881
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:56,021
I was surprised by your kiss.

882
01:50:56,270 --> 01:50:57,270
Yes.

883
01:50:59,570 --> 01:52:31,191
I'm sorry Your
forehead is so red.

884
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:38,091
I'm sorry, but I have to put up with this.

885
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:41,200
I'm so sorry.

886
01:52:58,230 --> 01:52:59,270
You're crying.

887
01:53:06,315 --> 01:53:08,076
I've been crying since
before I went to bed.

888
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,300
Since when?

889
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:12,301
I don't know.

890
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,220
How do you feel?

891
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,621
You look like you're in a bad mood.

892
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:23,610
You look like you're in a bad mood.

893
01:58:23,611 --> 01:58:24,611
It's hot.

894
01:58:29,210 --> 01:58:30,570
Do you want me to wipe your tears?

895
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:33,390
Are you ready?

896
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,040
I'll wipe your tears.

897
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:14,890
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

898
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:24,730
Are you okay?

899
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,040
Are you okay?

900
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:38,820
Yes.

901
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:46,550
Are you okay?

902
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:58,270
I'm going to move.

903
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,190
I'm going to move.

904
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:29,800
No, you can't.

905
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,080
What?

906
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:34,560
I was surprised.

907
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:38,380
Which one is it?

908
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:39,580
Open your eyes.

909
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:22,610
How do you feel?

910
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:27,850
It's warm and comfortable.

911
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,120
It's hard.

912
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,660
I'm so tired.

913
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:57,880
I'm so tired.

914
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:13,010
Do you mind if I do it slowly?

915
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:15,510
Do you mind?

916
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:17,730
Do you mind if I do it slowly?

917
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,220
I'm so tired.

918
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:54,600
Toto is already in pain.

919
02:04:54,601 --> 02:04:56,960
Toto has lost her ability to speak.

920
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:08,360
I'm sorry for the pain.

921
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,060
Your pain is not bad.

922
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:12,950
I'm sorry.

923
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,560
I'll do it slowly.

924
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:48,210
I'm so happy.

925
02:07:56,940 --> 02:09:06,740
I'm so happy.

926
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:14,470
Does it hurt?

927
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:51,700
I'm so happy.

928
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:56,800
Yes, that's right.

929
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:22,080
Do you move by yourself?

930
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:23,500
Yes.

931
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,720
Because I don't have a place to move.

932
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:44,740
Oh, it's hot.

933
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:51,580
Oh, that's great.

934
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:57,790
Oh, you can move.

935
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,661
If you can't move, can you
put your legs on the floor?

936
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:03,530
I'll put my legs behind you.

937
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:06,191
It's easier for you to move, isn't it?

938
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:12,690
Oh, my God.

939
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,770
I feel so good.

940
02:11:17,605 --> 02:11:19,570
I feel so good.

941
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:42,860
I feel so good.

942
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:04,800
I'm sorry.

943
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:07,300
I'm sorry.

944
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:26,070
I'm sorry.

945
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,820
I like a bath.

946
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:08,740
Can I give you a bath?

947
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:50,260
I'm sorry.

948
02:13:50,261 --> 02:13:51,261
Oh, my God.

949
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:56,600
You really like the bag, don't you?

950
02:13:58,090 --> 02:13:59,140
I'm so wet.

951
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,020
Does it feel good?

952
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:37,060
I'm sorry.

953
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:55,250
It's so hard I can't help it I
can't help it Are you sleepy?

954
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:58,971
I'm tired You are tired.

955
02:14:59,350 --> 02:15:00,510
I'm tired.

956
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:24,300
I'm tired.

957
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,440
I'm tired.

958
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:37,421
I'm glad you're getting better...
Let's take a deep breath.

959
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:05,450
Hmmm.

960
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:32,220
It's a little unpleasant.

961
02:17:32,221 --> 02:17:33,221
I'm sorry.

962
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,440
I'm sorry.

963
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:24,910
I'm sorry.

964
02:18:25,230 --> 02:18:27,050
It's cold.

965
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:34,590
I'm sorry.

966
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:21,640
I'm sorry.

967
02:20:34,200 --> 02:21:01,020
Can I say something?

968
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:18,680
He's eating.

969
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:29,960
Thank you for your hard work.

970
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:32,520
I didn't expect you to eat so much

971
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:33,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

972
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:36,740
You have something on your finger.

973
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:41,140
It feels so good.

974
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:53,130
He's in a bad
mood It's not that.

975
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:54,530
It's a horn.

976
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,830
It's bitter.

977
02:21:58,390 --> 02:21:59,390
I'm sorry.

978
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:14,040
It feels so good.

979
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:18,620
I'm sorry to bother you in the morning.

980
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:20,920
It's okay.

981
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:22,780
I can't go home early in the morning.

982
02:22:22,781 --> 02:22:23,781
I don't know.

983
02:22:26,530 --> 02:22:27,530
Did you feel good?

984
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:29,940
I feel like I'm going to sleep.

985
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:32,500
On the contrary,

986
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,860
I'm going to take a break, too.

987
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:47,600
I'll wipe it off.

988
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:50,340
Thank you.

989
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,220
Are you a person who
can do it in the morning?

990
02:22:54,221 --> 02:22:55,221
Did you do it on purpose?

991
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:59,300
Maybe I did it on purpose.

992
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:03,060
I see.

993
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:06,600
Can I do it again?

994
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:11,940
Can I do it again?

995
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:14,180
Let's do it again.

996
02:23:17,650 --> 02:23:18,650
Thank you.

997
02:23:27,230 --> 02:23:28,230
It's hot, isn't it?

998
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:32,640
Are you tired?

999
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,560
No, I'm happy.

1000
02:23:40,890 --> 02:23:43,450
Is this the end?

1001
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:46,590
Do you think so?

1002
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:53,370
I should have been more patient.

1003
02:23:54,350 --> 02:23:57,150
Did you feel so good?

1004
02:23:57,910 --> 02:23:59,910
Yes, I felt good.

1005
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:01,990
I felt good, too.

1006
02:24:08,645 --> 02:24:11,360
It's been a while since
the last time I saw you.

1007
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:12,480
You're right.

1008
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:18,140
It was fun, wasn't it?

1009
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:19,420
Yes, it was.

1010
02:24:46,350 --> 02:24:48,740
I can't believe this is the last time.

1011
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:52,260
Thank you for your time.

1012
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:54,360
You're welcome.

1013
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:16,590
Thank you for your hard work.

1014
02:25:28,010 --> 02:25:29,010
You're welcome.

1015
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,270
You're welcome.

1016
02:25:33,140 --> 02:25:34,290
You're welcome.

1017
02:25:34,470 --> 02:25:35,470
You're welcome.

1018
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:36,890
You're welcome.

1019
02:25:36,891 --> 02:25:37,971
I thought it wasn't enough.

1020
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:55,750
It's funny.

1021
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,870
He's surprised.

1022
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:08,910
Do as you like.

1023
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:12,930
Come here.

1024
02:26:22,350 --> 02:26:28,720
Come here.

1025
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:39,960
Lie down here.

1026
02:26:42,990 --> 02:26:44,110
Oh, you're wearing a T-mask.

1027
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:46,720
I'm tired.

1028
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:48,380
You're wearing a T-mask.

1029
02:26:51,140 --> 02:27:01,590
You're so cute.

1030
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:16,740
Are you looking forward
to seeing more of Ecchi?

1031
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:19,180
Yes.

1032
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:21,460
Please look at me.

1033
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:35,880
Oh, it feels good.

1034
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:07,420
Do you want me to take it off?

1035
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,860
I can see your buttocks very well.

1036
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:24,100
Oho!

1037
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:25,020
Fufufu

1038
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,020
Ah...

1039
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:35,741
Wah... Fufufu.

1040
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:44,081
Ah... Ah... Ah... Oho... What
do you think you're touching?

1041
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:47,201
My butt... I'm being licked.

1042
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:48,440
Does it feel good?

1043
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:48,920
Yes.

1044
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:50,600
It feels good.

1045
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:54,060
Ah...

1046
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,400
Ah...

1047
02:28:58,100 --> 02:28:59,100
Ah...

1048
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:01,620
Oh...

1049
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:18,230
Oh...

1050
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:29,740
Ah... Oh...

1051
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,400
Oh...

1052
02:29:36,100 --> 02:30:00,020
Ah...

1053
02:30:00,470 --> 02:30:02,440
Ah...

1054
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:08,220
It's hard.

1055
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:10,140
This is hard.

1056
02:30:10,141 --> 02:30:11,141
It's hard, isn't it?

1057
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:16,460
Ah!

1058
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:18,640
It's very wrinkled.

1059
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:22,040
Do you feel good?

1060
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:23,220
Yes.

1061
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,040
Ah, ah.

1062
02:30:42,730 --> 02:30:43,810
Oh.

1063
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:57,400
Oh.

1064
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:57,980
Oh.

1065
02:30:57,981 --> 02:31:01,620
Please don't do this to me anymore.

1066
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,280
Do you like me?

1067
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:52,760
I'm going to kiss you a lot.

1068
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:25,640
I'm going to put a lot
of water on your feet.

1069
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:54,630
I'm going to put a lot
of water on your feet.

1070
02:32:54,631 --> 02:32:54,750
Please relax.

1071
02:32:55,470 --> 02:32:56,470
I'll massage your legs.

1072
02:32:58,330 --> 02:32:59,930
Do you want to lie down?

1073
02:33:07,340 --> 02:33:09,690
You're very tense.

1074
02:33:22,090 --> 02:33:23,670
You're very tense.

1075
02:33:26,090 --> 02:33:26,310
Really?

1076
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:27,790
I'm sorry.

1077
02:34:06,510 --> 02:34:08,510
Oh, my God...

1078
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:21,620
Oh, my God...

1079
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:34,040
It's good.

1080
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,040
It's good.

1081
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:50,090
It's so hot.

1082
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:57,330
Do you want me to give you some water?

1083
02:35:57,810 --> 02:35:59,190
No, I'm fine.

1084
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:35,950
Why are you so sleepy?

1085
02:37:11,900 --> 02:37:12,900
I'm sorry.

1086
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:13,560
I'm sorry.

1087
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:14,980
Which side do you feel better?

1088
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:16,920
I feel better in both sides.

1089
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:19,040
Both sides?

1090
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:20,520
Yes.

1091
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:22,600
I'm sorry.

1092
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:26,780
I'm sorry.

1093
02:37:26,781 --> 02:37:26,800
I'm sorry.

1094
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:27,360
I'm sorry.

1095
02:37:27,361 --> 02:37:28,361
I'm sorry.

1096
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:32,060
Do you want me to do more?

1097
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:33,320
Yes.

1098
02:37:35,090 --> 02:37:36,600
If I drop it, it'll come out.

1099
02:38:42,730 --> 02:38:44,230
I want to lick it too.

1100
02:38:45,630 --> 02:38:46,630
Let me lick it.

1101
02:38:48,930 --> 02:38:49,930
Lick as much as you want.

1102
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:25,370
It's hot.

1103
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:53,050
Oh, it's hot.

1104
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:58,700
Was it good?

1105
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,400
Yes, it was.

1106
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:29,080
What do you want me to do?

1107
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:31,300
What are you doing?

1108
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:37,660
What are you doing?

1109
02:40:37,661 --> 02:40:38,661
What are you doing?

1110
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:51,720
What are you doing?

1111
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:56,460
It's cold.

1112
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:59,960
What do you think I'm doing?

1113
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:11,240
Oh...

1114
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:17,910
What is it?

1115
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:41,660
What's wrong? Does it hurt?

1116
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:44,960
Here...

1117
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:52,400
It's in.

1118
02:41:57,770 --> 02:42:05,120
I'm sorry.

1119
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:05,560
It's okay.

1120
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:07,300
I'm sorry.

1121
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:18,420
I'm sorry.

1122
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:42,980
I'm sorry.

1123
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:38,010
What is it?

1124
02:43:38,011 --> 02:43:38,250
Mango.

1125
02:43:38,890 --> 02:43:40,250
Mango is so cute.

1126
02:43:40,650 --> 02:43:41,650
What is it?

1127
02:43:42,190 --> 02:43:43,190
It's a manko, isn't it?

1128
02:43:43,630 --> 02:43:44,910
It's not a butt, is it?

1129
02:43:46,190 --> 02:43:49,570
Which one do you think it is?

1130
02:43:50,730 --> 02:43:51,730
It's a manko.

1131
02:43:56,620 --> 02:43:58,130
This is my case.

1132
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:02,130
It's a manko.

1133
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:06,910
Thank you.

1134
02:44:11,390 --> 02:44:12,710
Does it feel good?

1135
02:44:13,710 --> 02:44:15,090
It feels good.

1136
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:21,170
It feels good.

1137
02:45:05,150 --> 02:45:11,780
It hurts.

1138
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:38,860
I'm sorry.

1139
02:45:54,190 --> 02:45:55,300
It hurts.

1140
02:46:00,140 --> 02:46:01,140
Are you okay?

1141
02:46:01,620 --> 02:46:02,620
Are you okay?

1142
02:46:08,140 --> 02:46:14,420
Oh, no.

1143
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:30,190
I said I'm okay.

1144
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:52,640
I can't see anything.

1145
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:57,630
No, I can't.

1146
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:19,140
Ah!

1147
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:21,140
Yeah.

1148
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:22,260
Kimchi.

1149
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:24,750
Oh!

1150
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:26,340
Oh!

1151
02:47:32,770 --> 02:47:33,930
Oh!

1152
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:36,030
Oh!

1153
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:42,740
Kimchi is so good.

1154
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:44,840
Do you want some?

1155
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:46,140
Yes.

1156
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,480
I want to drink a lot.

1157
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:55,960
Wow!

1158
02:47:55,961 --> 02:47:59,840
I'm sorry.

1159
02:48:53,880 --> 02:49:02,490
Can I lick you?

1160
02:49:07,710 --> 02:49:14,800
Do you like it?

1161
02:49:19,365 --> 02:49:30,900
Do you like it?

1162
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:35,580
Do you like it?

1163
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:36,680
Does it feel good?

1164
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:38,400
Yes, it does.

1165
02:49:46,380 --> 02:49:47,700
You're getting bigger and bigger.

1166
02:49:57,880 --> 02:50:00,580
Do you feel better?

1167
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:06,680
ow.

1168
02:51:16,410 --> 02:51:18,510

02:52:00,730 --> 02:52:03,790
Thank you very much.

1171
02:52:04,330 --> 02:52:04,830
Really?

1172
02:52:05,090 --> 02:52:06,410
Wow.

1173
02:52:07,190 --> 02:52:08,510
Wow.

1174
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:13,560
Wow.

1175
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:15,600
I'm sorry.

1176
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:29,380
I'm sorry.

1177
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:40,160
I'm sorry.

1178
02:52:57,600 --> 02:52:59,180
You're standing up.

1179
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:07,750
I have a favor to ask you.

1180
02:53:09,780 --> 02:53:10,830
Let me lick your feet.

1181
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:14,000
Do you want to lick my feet?

1182
02:53:19,330 --> 02:53:33,580
Do you want to lick my feet?

1183
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:06,590
Something is coming out.

1184
02:54:09,110 --> 02:54:11,370
Are you excited to drink the soup?

1185
02:54:16,110 --> 02:54:17,210
It's hot.

1186
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:35,710
Can I have more?

1187
02:54:36,450 --> 02:54:36,950
More?

1188
02:54:37,190 --> 02:54:38,190
More.

1189
02:55:10,510 --> 02:55:11,790
I'll take it for you.

1190
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:19,930
This is for you.

1191
02:55:23,410 --> 02:55:23,870
I'll give it to you.

1192
02:55:23,871 --> 02:55:25,810
Oh, my God.

1193
02:55:42,060 --> 02:55:43,140
Thank you for your efforts.

1194
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:26,855
Thank you.

1195
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:10,190
I'm going to put in the next one.

1196
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:17,730
Thank you.

1197
02:57:18,130 --> 02:57:19,130
Please.

1198
02:58:40,890 --> 02:58:44,380

I'm sorry.

1202
03:00:05,630 --> 03:00:26,330
I can't do it anymore.

1203
03:00:37,950 --> 03:00:39,030
My legs are going to break.

1204
03:00:39,250 --> 03:00:41,170
Can I do more?

1205
03:00:42,250 --> 03:00:43,950
Do more.

1206
03:00:49,310 --> 03:00:51,030
Do you want more?

1207
03:00:54,390 --> 03:00:55,390
More.

1208
03:01:03,830 --> 03:01:04,830
I want you to move.

1209
03:01:33,330 --> 03:01:35,940
I can't do it.

1210
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:48,640
I can't do it.

1211
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:50,020
I can't do it.

1212
03:01:54,160 --> 03:02:01,630
I can't do it.

1213
03:02:17,660 --> 03:02:19,440
Not yet.

1214
03:02:19,880 --> 03:02:20,880
Not enough.

1215
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:26,400
Stretch your body.

1216
03:02:29,320 --> 03:02:30,320
Give me your hand.

1217
03:02:36,220 --> 03:03:10,400
Give me your hand.

1218
03:03:10,401 --> 03:03:11,401
I'm going to fall.

1219
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:25,580
I'm going to throw up.

1220
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:31,840
I'm going to throw up.

1221
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:46,960
Why are you crying?

1222
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:48,240
I'm sorry.

1223
03:03:51,850 --> 03:03:53,190
Hang in there.

1224
03:03:57,880 --> 03:03:58,880
Hang in there.

1225
03:04:04,040 --> 03:04:05,740
It's hot.

1226
03:04:14,440 --> 03:04:15,560
I'm sorry.

1227
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:16,840
I'm sorry.

1228
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:19,680
It hurts.

1229
03:04:20,820 --> 03:04:27,000
It hurts.

1230
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:28,260
It hurts.

1231
03:04:29,540 --> 03:04:36,940
Can I take it slowly?

1232
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:38,760
No.

1233
03:04:40,210 --> 03:04:41,210
No.

1234
03:04:42,890 --> 03:04:44,560
Please forgive me.

1235
03:04:44,561 --> 03:04:45,561
No.

1236
03:04:48,090 --> 03:04:57,690
I'm sorry.

1237
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:34,240
I'm sorry.

1238
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:06,940
I'm sorry.

1239
03:06:08,500 --> 03:06:10,240
Are you okay?

1240
03:06:10,640 --> 03:06:12,960
I'm fine.

1241
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:17,300
I'm fine.

1242
03:06:42,380 --> 03:06:47,150
Your tummy hurts, right?

1243
03:06:57,360 --> 03:06:59,330
It hurts, huh?

1244
03:06:59,331 --> 03:07:01,550
It hurts, doesn't it?

1245
03:07:09,450 --> 03:07:10,490
Don't do it!

1246
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:26,830
It doesn't hurt, does it?

1247
03:07:35,700 --> 03:07:36,830
It doesn't hurt, does it?

1248
03:07:37,930 --> 03:07:38,930
It doesn't hurt, does it?

1249
03:07:55,580 --> 03:07:56,960
I'm so tired.

1250
03:07:58,770 --> 03:07:59,770
I'm so tired.

1251
03:08:02,760 --> 03:08:05,100
I'm so tired.

1252
03:08:14,690 --> 03:08:21,190
Do you feel better?

1253
03:08:21,930 --> 03:08:23,090
I feel so good.

1254
03:08:26,240 --> 03:08:27,306
You can still sleep, right?

1255
03:08:27,330 --> 03:08:28,330
No, I can't.

1256
03:08:30,250 --> 03:08:31,250
I can't.

1257
03:08:31,450 --> 03:08:32,450
I can't.

1258
03:08:32,510 --> 03:08:33,510
I can't.

1259
03:08:34,570 --> 03:08:36,130
I can't.

1260
03:08:36,131 --> 03:08:37,131
Wow.

1261
03:08:39,410 --> 03:08:40,410
Wow.

1262
03:08:44,190 --> 03:08:45,190
Wow.

1263
03:08:48,370 --> 03:08:49,370
Wow.

1264
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:52,030
Wow.

1265
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:53,390
Thank you for your viewing.
