1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,280
Can I join you? Yes, you can.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,320
It's good.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,150
I want to touch it.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,430
Is it that good?

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,150
Yes.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,450
Oh, yes.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,450
Oh, yes.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,750
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,060
Oh, it feels good.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, it feels good.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Oh, it feels good.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,340
Oh, yes.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,440
Oh, yes.

14
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,441
Wow.

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,790
It's so big, isn't it, Chin-chin?

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,870
Don't go in there. It's too big.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:02,260
Can I go in there?
Sure, go ahead.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,900
It's so wet.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700


20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,740
Your skin is so clean.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
It's so clean.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,440
It's so clean.

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,380
It's cold.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,340
It's delicious.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
It's great.

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,760
It feels good.

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,620
It's great.

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,630
There is a tent near here.

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,140
Isn't there a mountain?

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,700
No, there isn't.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,480
There is no mountain, but it's very hot.

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,920
The beach is next to the beach.

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,920
It's a road.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,660
I heard the story earlier.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,360
I want to go to the insect farm.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
I want to go.

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Do they eat honey? I don't know.

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280


39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,140
What do they eat?

40
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,141
Is this a waterfall?

41
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,930
Is this a waterfall?

42
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:06,020
Let's get out of here.

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,900
Don't worry about it.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Excuse me.

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,770
Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine.

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,810


47
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,260
Is it OK if I take a bath
with you? Of course.

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760


49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,980
I didn't bring my swimsuit
because I didn't know this bath.

50
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,700
I see.

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,300
It's OK.

53
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,720
It feels good.

54
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Yes, it does.

55
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,420
Are you students?

56
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,421
Are you a student? Yes, I am.

57
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,340
Are you a student? Yes, I am.

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,980
I see.

59
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660


60
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:31,736
Do you go to the same school?

61
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,120
What kind of friends do you have?

62
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,040
We all go to the same school.

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
I see.

64
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,640
Do you come here often?

65
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,700
This is my first time.

66
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
I see.

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,740
This is my first time to come here.

68
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,600
I see.

69
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,880
Isn't everyone a little far away?

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
No, it's my first time.

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,080
Can I talk to you a little
closer? No, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,940


73
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
If you don't mind.

74
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,300
Really?

75
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:02,780
Yes.

76
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,540
Then, excuse me.

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,240
Yes.

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Thank you.

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,620
Can I sit here? Yes, please.

80
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,160


81
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,460
Did everyone come by car today?

82
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Did you come by
boat? I can drive.

83
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900


84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,220
Oh, you can drive.

85
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
That's great.

86
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,040
Am I in the way? No, no, no.

87
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,760
You don't have
to worry about it.

88
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,380
You can stay with us.

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,460
Why do you want me to stay with you?

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
I came here by myself.

91
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
I see.

92
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I see.

93
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,260
That's great.

94
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:50,940
How old are all the
students? 21 years old.

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,480


96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,260
Oh, you are young.

97
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,740
Because you are an old lady.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
No, I'm not an old lady.

99
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,220
You don't look like an old lady.

100
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,940
No, I'm not. I'm 21 years old.
It's been many years.

101
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,260
Are you married? Yes, I am.

102
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,400
I am married.

103
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,500
But I don't come here with my husband.

104
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
I come here alone.

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,120
Do you go on a trip with
your girlfriend? No, I don't.

106
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540


107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,160
I don't go where I want to go.

108
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,820
Really? What do you mean?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
I don't have a girlfriend.

110
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,360
I see.

111
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,260
I've never had a girlfriend.

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
You've never had a
girlfriend? No, no, no.

113
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm from Rakumatsu prefecture.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
I see.

115
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,401
Have you ever watched it with
your ex-girlfriend? No, I haven't.

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,900


117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Really?

118
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,150
Everyone around me has.

119
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I see.

120
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,140
But everyone is so cool.

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,936
You can do it right away,
can't you? No, no, no.

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,860


123
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,820
If I can't do it for 20
years, I'll lose confidence.

124
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Really? I don't know.

125
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480


126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,580
I don't have confidence at all.

127
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,020
I want to have a girlfriend.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,980
What can you do to have
a girlfriend? I don't know.

129
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,640


130
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,680
I think it would be nice if I was
the same age as everyone else.

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Really? I'm sorry.

132
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,020


133
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:37,416
I think it would be nice if I was
the same age as everyone else.

134
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,460
Thank you.

135
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,740
It feels good. It's been a while
since I came to a place like this.

136
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,400
Yes, it's been a while.

137
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,220
It's good.

138
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,820
Is it? Yes, it is.

139
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I'm nervous.

140
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140


141
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Really?

142
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,640
Isn't it too far?

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
Can you come a little closer?

144
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Yes.

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
It's better to be closer.

146
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Do you have any
friends? Not at all.

147
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,960


148
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,580
Really?

149
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,780
It's more fun to talk with everyone.

150
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
I don't know how far it is.

151
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,360
If you make a mistake, it's scary.

152
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Really? Not at all.

153
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460


154
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,171
Isn't it easier to
talk here? Certainly.

155
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420


156
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,620
I thought no one would come here.

157
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Me, too.

158
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,320
I thought young people would come here.

159
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Yes, they do.

160
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,300
I'm glad I came here today.

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
You're lucky to have met her.

162
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,940
I should have brought my swimsuit.

163
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
I forgot.

164
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,400
I want to see you today, but I can't.

165
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I don't need it.

166
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,540
Really?

167
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,820
It's so beautiful,
isn't it? I'm so happy.

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560


169
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,954
If you are a young girl
like us, it's better to be

170
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,540
a young girl than an old woman
like me, isn't it? No, no, no.

171
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,580
I don't think so.

172
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
I don't think so.

173
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,220
I don't have any needles.

174
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,480
I don't feel anything.

175
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm absorbing everything.

176
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
I think you have a lot of needles.

177
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Try touching it.

178
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
May I?

179
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Try touching it.

180
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,670
I'll try.

181
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:45,300
Touch it properly.

182
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,105
It's so soft.

183
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,160
It's very soft and feels good.

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:53,960
Really?

185
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Yes.

186
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
It feels so good.

187
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm so happy.

188
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
It's amazing.

189
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
What?

190
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,420
What?

191
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,260
Do you want to touch it?

192
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,660
Can I?

193
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Yes.

194
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,640
I feel like I'm being sucked in.

195
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,640
Really? I'm so happy.

196
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,200
Your skin is beautiful.

197
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
It's so white.

198
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,980
You don't go out,
do you? No, no, no.

199
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
I don't go out.

200
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,880
It's good.

201
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,600


202
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,140
I think it's really good.

203
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,141
I see.

204
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,060
I'm old, but I feel like I'm
getting energy from everyone.

205
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Really?

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,420
I feel like I'm getting more energy.

207
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,960
Really? Yes, really.

208
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120


209
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,900
By the way, everyone's reaction is so cute.

210
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Really?

211
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
I've never been told that.

212
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Really? Excuse me.

213
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
Excuse me, I'm watching you.

214
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,801
Oh, I'm sorry.

215
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,700
You said you've never
had a girlfriend, right?

216
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,420
Yes.

217
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,040
Have you ever had such an experience?

218
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:08,940
What?

219
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,421
Have you ever had such an experience?

220
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,940
No.

221
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
What about you?

222
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
What?

223
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,460
What?

224
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,920
I've never had such an experience.

225
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,500
I've never had such an experience.

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,700
What? You haven't?

227
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:24,980
What?

228
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,480
No comment, please.

229
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:27,560
It's a secret.

230
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,340
It's cute.

231
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,510
But you don't like it, do you?

232
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,540
What don't you like?

233
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know what a man
without experience is like.

234
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,660
It's embarrassing and
I don't want to do it.

235
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,260
Really? Isn't it cute?

236
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,880
I didn't know you could do that.

237
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,560
I thought it was cute.

238
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,820
Do you want to see my boobs?

239
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
What?

240
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Are you serious?

241
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,120
Do you want to see
them? No, I don't.

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Well, this is.

243
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,860
..

244
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,440
No, I'm fine.

245
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,060
I want to show them to you.

246
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,380
I want to see them.

247
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you want to see
them? Then, let's go.

248
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060


249
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Wow!

250
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,760
It's so beautiful.

251
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
Have you ever seen
boobs? Yes, I have.

252
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,381
I've seen them in the middle
of a pornographic video.

253
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Oh, really?

254
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,720
In a pornographic video?

255
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,340
Yes.

256
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I see.

257
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,150
It's the first time I've
seen them in real life.

258
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,500
I don't know what I should do.

259
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,520
What should you do?

260
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
I don't know what to do.

261
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,660
I think it's beautiful.

262
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,920
It's really beautiful.

263
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,200
Do you want to touch it?

264
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,640
What should I do?

265
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Do you want to touch it?

266
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,000
Can I touch it?

267
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:18,080
Can I touch your belly?

268
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
Yes.

269
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Can I touch your belly?

270
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Yes.

271
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,400
What?

272
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:29,420
What? No, no, no.

273
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
No, no, no.

274
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,180


275
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,480
Can I touch your belly?

276
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Yes.

277
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,820
Really?

278
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,740
Yes.

279
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Let's touch it together.

280
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,600
Ready, set, go!

281
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,800
Ready, set, go!

282
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,000
It's pretty big, isn't it?

283
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Is it? I think it's H.

284
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,940


285
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
H?

286
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,920
It's huge!

287
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,420
Really?

288
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,300
It's really big.

289
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,880
Really?

290
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,160
I've never heard of it.

291
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
I've never heard of it.

292
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Is that so?

293
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
I'm going to touch the edge cup.

294
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,460
It's really soft.

295
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
You can touch it.

296
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,900
Like this? Yes, you can.

297
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,960


298
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I want to touch it.

299
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,320
Is it that good?

300
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,580
Wow, it's amazing.

301
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,876
The one you are looking at is
also amazing, isn't it? Yes, it is.

302
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900


303
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Wow, it's amazing.

304
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,740
How is it? It's amazing.

305
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
It's changed.

306
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,420


307
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Next, next, next.

308
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Is it OK?

309
00:14:51,770 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm so impressed.

310
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,760
Are you impressed?

311
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,220
Yes.

312
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Is it OK?

313
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,840
No, no, no, no, no.

314
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,841
You look great.

315
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,180
Do you feel your
nipples? Yes, I do.

316
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,260


317
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Can I touch your
nipples? Yes, you can.

318
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380


319
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,060
How can I touch your nipples?

320
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,450
You can touch as much as you want.

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Your nipples are getting hard.

322
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,670
Are they getting
hard? Yes, they are.

323
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,870
Can I touch it? Yes, you can.

324
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,330
It's hard.

325
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,390


326
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:11,430
Isn't it painful?

327
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,110
No, it doesn't hurt.

328
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:13,250
How do you feel? It feels good.

329
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,790


330
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,440
Is it your first time to touch it?

331
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,560
Yes.

332
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,180
It feels so good.

333
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:40,240
I don't know how to do it.

334
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,460
It's so good.

335
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,100
Thank you.

336
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:50,520
Thank you very much.

337
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,220
I'd appreciate it if you could
tell me how to touch boobs.

338
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
How to touch
boobs? I don't know.

339
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,700


340
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,040
Well, like this.

341
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,080
Like this?

342
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Doesn't it hurt? Not at all.

343
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
Like this.

344
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,460


345
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
It doesn't hurt at all.

346
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,280
Like this.

347
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,281
Is it painful? Yes, it is.

348
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,461
Do you feel pain in
your neck? Yes, I do.

349
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,541
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

350
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,540
It is stronger than I thought.

351
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,640
It might be painful if I squeeze your neck.

352
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,840
But it is not painful at all.

353
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,180
I want to try it.

354
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
OK.

355
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,760
Like this.

356
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,000
Like this.

357
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,620
It looks like this.

358
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,780
Does it hurt more if I do this?

359
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,400
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

360
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,460
Let me see.

361
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,420
It doesn't hurt.

362
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,860
Like this.

363
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:03,340
It's okay.

364
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Don't touch your nipples.

365
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:09,940
Like this? Ah, yes, yes.

366
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340


367
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,280
Ah, it feels good.

368
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,100
Yes, yes, yes.

369
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Do you want to
press it? Yes, it's okay.

370
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,740


371
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,020
Does it feel good?

372
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Yes.

373
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,530
It feels good because
I can touch it firmly.

374
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,340
How does it feel when you lick it?

375
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,000
What?

376
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
How does it feel when you lick it?

377
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:51,700
It feels good when I lick it.

378
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:54,840
I want to drink a lot.

379
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,020
I want to drink a lot.

380
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:56,040
Do you want to drink a lot?

381
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,080
If you don't mind, I'll drink a lot.

382
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,420
Then I'll drink a lot.

383
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,240
No, no, no.

384
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Can I drink a lot? Yes, you can.

385
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:14,300


386
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:21,770
You can drink a lot.

387
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:22,771
You can lick my hand.

388
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,680
Does it feel good?

389
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,680
Please rub my hand.

390
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,480
It feels good.

391
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,740
It feels good.

392
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Oh, it's hot.

393
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,940
It's hot, isn't it? Yes, it is.

394
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,500


395
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,180
Have you ever seen the sunset?

396
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:15,920
What? Yes, I have.

397
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,740
Tomorrow?

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No.

399
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,040
Do you want to see it?

400
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,410
Do you want to see it?

401
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,860
Can I?

402
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,660
Can I?

403
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,260
Yes.

404
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:32,840
Can I show it to
you? Yes, you can.

405
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,000
Can I show it to
you? Yes, you can.

406
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,001


407
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
Can I show it to
you? Yes, you can.

408
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,560
Uncle, come closer.

409
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Yes.

410
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,580
It doesn't disappear.

411
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,060
It doesn't disappear.

412
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
It's very easy to see.

413
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
It's dyed.

414
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,340
It's pink inside.

415
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:34,120
Is it your first time to see this?

416
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
Yes.

417
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:40,020
It's like this.

418
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,960
Do you want to touch this?

419
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,280
May I?

420
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:54,340
Can I sit here? Yes, you can.

421
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,820
Thank you.

422
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:57,280
Be gentle.

423
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,040


424
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,560
How is it? It's very hot.

425
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260


426
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Is it hot?

427
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,930
You're good at touching.

428
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,910
I'm just trying to touch gently.

429
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,790
It's not your first time, is it?

430
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,030
No, it's really my first time.

431
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,250
Really? And, well.

432
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,790
..

433
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:43,791
My fingers are tired.

434
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,070
It feels good, though.

435
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,990
Oh, it feels good.

436
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,110
Can I touch your
ear? No, you can't.

437
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,430


438
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,190
How about here? No, I can't.

439
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,150


440
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,160
Can I touch your
ear? No, you can't.

441
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,200


442
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,750
I've never been touched so much.

443
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,490
I can't believe it.

444
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,990
It hurts so much.

445
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,530
I can't move at all.

446
00:23:45,000 --> 00:24:05,840
You were pulling the string.

447
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:08,580
It's true.

448
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:21,050
Wow, it's amazing. I've never been
touched this much, and I feel good.

449
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,630
Why don't we put it inside?

450
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:33,050
If we put it in such
a place, will it get in?

451
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,730
Yes, it may get in.

452
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,530
Oh, yeah.

453
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,230
Oh, yeah.

454
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:41,231
It's not there.

455
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Oh, yeah.

456
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,020
Oh, yeah.

457
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,800
Oh, yeah.

458
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,200
Doesn't it hurt?

459
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,280
It doesn't hurt at all.

460
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,485
It feels really good.

461
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,100
It feels good.

462
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,200
I don't know how to move it.

463
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,380
What should I do?

464
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,460
It's okay as it is.

465
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,440
Try to move it more.

466
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,020
Look at me.

467
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,021
Is that so?

468
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes, that's right.

469
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,240
Yes, that's right.

470
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
What's wrong? I don't like.

471
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,440
..

472
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,030
I don't like...

473
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,910
I don't like...

474
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,210
I don't like...

475
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,190
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

476
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,430
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

477
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:02,050
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

478
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,390
I know, I know.

479
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,980
I want you to lick me a little more.

480
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Can I lick you?

481
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Yes.

482
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
Come here.

483
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,680
Oh, like this?

484
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Yes.

485
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,360
Oh, it's so good.

486
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,780
It's so good.

487
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:17,781
Oh, it feels so good.

488
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,020
Oh, it feels so good.

489
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:35,140
Can you kiss me this time?

490
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,540
Can I? Yes, you can.

491
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580


492
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,420
Can I?

493
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Yes.

494
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,420
It's my first time.

495
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,800
Is it your first time?

496
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,480
Yes.

497
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Yes, it's OK.

498
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Oh!

499
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Oh!

500
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh!

501
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Oh!

502
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,260
Oh!

503
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,440
Oh!

504
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:07,600
Oh!

505
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,180
Oh!

506
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,940
Oh!

507
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,180
Oh!

508
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:09,380
Oh!

509
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh! I can do it.

510
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,540


511
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,980
Do you love me?

512
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Yes.

513
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,700
I want to do it, too.

514
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,760
Do you want to do it? Yes, I do.

515
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,240
We are standing side by side.

516
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,100
You can do it.

517
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,540
I can't stand it.

518
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
You can do it.

519
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,610
Oh, it's hot.

520
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,140
Here you are.

521
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,000
How is it? It's great.

522
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,340
My lips are softened.

523
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Really?

524
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
What's next? Please.

525
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500


526
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,740
Is this really your first time?

527
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Yes.

528
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Really?

529
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,080
You are really good at it.

530
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,060
When I kissed you,
didn't you react a little?

531
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,061
You haven't got up
yet? No, I haven't.

532
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200


533
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,180
You haven't got up
yet? No, I haven't.

534
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260


535
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,740
You must have got up,
haven't you? Yes, I have.

536
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,940


537
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,080
It's the first time to meet
you in the waiting room.

538
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,960
Well, I want to give you a bath.

539
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,060
Can't I lick you?

540
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Can I?

541
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,780
I want to lick you.

542
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,760
If you don't mind, I
want to ask you a favor.

543
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Can I?

544
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Can I?

545
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Yes.

546
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,210
What happened to your kiss?

547
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:05,291
Why is your hand
like this? I'm sorry.

548
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,790


549
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,370
By the way, my hand feels good.

550
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,030
Does it feel good?

551
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:11,610
Yes.

552
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,070
Like this? That's great.

553
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,870


554
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,040
How do you want me to touch you?

555
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,350
The way you touch me now.

556
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,990
Yes.

557
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,350
But I want to lick you.

558
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,650
Yes, please.

559
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,210
May I?

560
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,190
Wow!

561
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,000
Wow!

562
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,980
Oh, my gosh!

563
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,220
Wow!

564
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:55,050
Oh, my gosh!

565
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,510
Wow!

566
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,440
Wow!

567
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,180
I can't stand it.

568
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
What's wrong?

569
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Are you OK?

570
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
What? It's amazing.

571
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,370
This side, too.

572
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,070


573
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:25,990
Can I lick it? Yes, you can.

574
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,710
Oh, no.

575
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,970
Ah, it's hot.

576
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:13,710
It's hot.

577
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,451
Is it?

578
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,990
Yes, I feel good.

579
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,090
Let me see.

580
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,960
Oh, it feels so good.

581
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,520
Does it? Yes, it does.

582
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,301
What is this?

583
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,170
If I ask you to eat one by one,
will you get angry? No, I won't.

584
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,890


585
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,950
Then, I'll eat one by one.

586
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:16,951
It's good.

587
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
It's not good.

588
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
It's too good.

589
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,180
You can't drink it.

590
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,040
I'm sorry.

591
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,520
I can't drink it?

592
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
You can't drink it yet.

593
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,840
Hold on.

594
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
OK.

595
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:35,780
It's so good.

596
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,580
Can I say something?
No, you can't.

597
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,500


598
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,180
But I want to say something.

599
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,340
I think you're not ready yet.

600
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,680
Oh, my bag.

601
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,920
What? Is that so? Look at this.

602
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,940
It's full.

603
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,600
It's amazing, isn't it?

604
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
What should I do?

605
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,330
What should I do?

606
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,040
But you've never put it in a bag, have you?

607
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
No.

608
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,611
Then, why don't you put it in a bag?

609
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,656
Don't you want to go there
rather than go to Ferrari?

610
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,300
I want to graduate as a virgin.

611
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,780
Do you want to graduate today?

612
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Yes.

613
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,960
Then, from the back.

614
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,980
Put it in.

615
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,571
Isn't it difficult to do from the back?

616
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:52,860
I'll teach you, so it's okay.

617
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Yes.

618
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,600
Next, lower it more.

619
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:01,601
I'm going to do it.

620
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,860
More, more.

621
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
Yes, yes, there.

622
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Yes, there.

623
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Yes.

624
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Yes.

625
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
It's so good.

626
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,180
It's so good.

627
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,800
Did you get it?

628
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Yes.

629
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
It's so good.

630
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
It's so good.

631
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,680
Let me move it.

632
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:31,100
Wait a minute.
If you move now, I'll be gone soon.

633
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:31,700
What?

634
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,000
I'll be gone?

635
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,660
Yes.

636
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
It's heavy.

638
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
It feels good.

639
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Oh, no.

640
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,900
Can I move as it is?

641
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,960
Can you move?

642
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:33,200
Can you give me a
hand? No, you can't.

643
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,201
OK.

644
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,780
Oh, no.

645
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,460
I can't do it.

646
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
What?

647
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
Do you feel better? Yes, I do.

648
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320


649
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:38,290
Can you feel my heart
beating? Yes, I can.

650
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,570
It's beating fast.

651
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,970
Is it beating
fast? It feels good.

652
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,170
I'm sorry.

653
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:47,910
I'm sorry.

654
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:47,970
I'm sorry.

655
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,210
I'm sorry.

656
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
I'm sorry.

657
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm sorry.

658
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,490
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,050
I'm sorry.

660
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,870
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,260
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,340
I'm sorry.

663
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,680
I'm sorry.

664
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,320
I'm sorry.

665
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,430
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,690


667
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,830
Oh...

668
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
It feels so good.

669
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
I'll get it all over your face.

670
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Move your head.

671
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,820
It feels so good.

672
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,580
It feels so good.

673
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,880
Give me a kiss.

674
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,750
Oh, it feels so good.

675
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,890
Oh, it feels good.

676
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:26,450
Oh, it feels good.

677
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:37,360
Oh, it feels good.

678
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,700
Hey, come here.

679
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,940
Sit here.

680
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:07,330
Can I sit on it? It feels good.

681
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,860
It feels good.

682
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:58,590


683
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,980
Yoichi!

684
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,540
Can I stop? Yes, you can.

685
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,700
It feels good.

686
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:17,780


687
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,000
I feel good, too.

688
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,701
I want you to put it in from the back.

689
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
From the back?

690
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,840
Please follow me from behind.

691
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,430
Is this place OK? A little more.

692
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:13,910


693
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:15,930
Here?

694
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:16,510
Yes.

695
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,910
I'll put it in.

696
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,990
OK.

697
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,730
It feels good.

698
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,490
Follow me from behind.

699
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,890
It feels so good.

700
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,930
I want to go there, too.

701
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,230
OK.

702
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:44,790
Let's go.

703
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,570
Don't you want to
go there? Not yet.

704
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,790


705
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,660
Not yet?

706
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,930
I'm curious about it.

707
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:53,370
I'm sorry.

708
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,040
I feel so good.

709
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:33,650
I feel so good.

710
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,110
I feel so good.

711
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,280
I'm going now. See you later.

712
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,190
Thank you.

713
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:55,560
It's time to go home.

714
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,120
See you later.

715
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,710
We are the only ones in the
hot spring, aren't we? That's right.

716
00:50:29,711 --> 00:50:32,110
Other people don't come in.

717
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,670
It's not the same.

718
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,030
Is that so? This is normal.

719
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,210


720
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,510
I wonder if I'll come in.

721
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,641
By the way, have you decided on
your career path after graduation? I see.

722
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,850


723
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:47,870
Because it's not yet.

724
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,950
It's so beautiful.

725
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,030
Are you OK? Of course.

726
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:58,810


727
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,960
Are you OK? I'm sorry.

728
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,660


729
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,330
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

730
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:47,670
Isn't it very beautiful?

731
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,681
Such a beautiful person doesn't
come to Konnyaku, does she?

732
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,710
No, she doesn't.

733
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,750
I'm sure she'll come.

734
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,190
Really? That's great.

735
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,330
I'm so lucky.

736
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,720
I'm lucky, too.

737
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,960
It's so beautiful.

738
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,960
That's great.

739
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,840
There are so many people.

740
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:19,140
I'm nervous.

741
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,400
Hey, hey.

742
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,800
Yes?

743
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,960
Are you a college
student? Yes, I am.

744
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,520
Yes, yes, yes.

745
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,340
I see.

746
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800


747
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,060
I'm 20 years old.

748
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,300
Wow, you're young.

749
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:42,810
Are you here alone?

750
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,130
Yes, I'm here alone today.

751
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,950
Do you often go to the hot springs here?

752
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,501
Do you often go to the
hot springs? No, I don't.

753
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,130


754
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,810
I like hot springs, so I go to many places.

755
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,430
Are you alone?

756
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,860
Do you come later?

757
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,870
No, I'm alone today.

758
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,290
It's our first time.

759
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,010
Oh, is it? Yes, it is.

760
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,910


761
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,910
I was surprised.

762
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,410
I was surprised.

763
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,550
I feel good.

764
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:01,890
Chikkun, can you
see it? I found it.

765
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,220
It's amazing.

766
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:04,870


767
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,110
It's really big.

768
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,510
What kind of bread
is it? I don't know.

769
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,730


770
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:28,750
Is it EF? I don't know.

771
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,540
It's crazy.

772
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,710
Great.

773
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:35,570


774
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,220
How old is she? I don't know.

775
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,920


776
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
She is so beautiful.

777
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,820
Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:52,740
Yes? Yes, yes, yes.

779
00:54:52,741 --> 00:54:54,920
What are you talking about?

780
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:55,800
What? No, no, no.

781
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320


782
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,340
Well, well, well.

783
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,600
It's a little bit of a gossip.

784
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:01,601
It's a gossip.

785
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,190
Do you have a girlfriend?

786
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,540
What? No, I don't.

787
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,720


788
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,100
What? Even though you are
a college student? Well, yes.

789
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,760
I see.

790
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400


791
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,370
What grade are you
in? Second grade.

792
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,580
Second grade?

793
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,820
I'm not that popular.

794
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,540
I see.

795
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,221
Are you in the same high school?

796
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Yes.

797
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,540
I heard that you don't
come to the temple often.

798
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
You are so nice.

799
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,140
I'm always welcomed.

800
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,200
I'm the first visitor.

801
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,040
I see.

802
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,980
What kind of circle do you join?

803
00:55:56,945 --> 00:55:58,700
You all have good bodies.

804
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,170
No, no, no.

805
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,460
You have a lot of muscles.

806
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:10,756
I'm going to tell you something.

807
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,480
What is it? You look tired.

808
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:12,800


809
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,271
It's a sports club, isn't it?

810
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,380
It's a sports club.

811
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,600
I play basketball.

812
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,500
I didn't know you could
train your body like this.

813
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,100
That's right.

814
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
That's amazing.

815
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,000
There are a lot of leaves.

816
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,960
Let's take a picture together.

817
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,500
There are a lot of leaves.

818
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,300
There are a lot of leaves.

819
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,100
It's amazing.

820
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:55,930
Thank you.

821
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,520
I'm embarrassed.

822
00:57:04,185 --> 00:57:05,440
I'm embarrassed.

823
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,120
Why?

824
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:08,800
It's embarrassing to be so obvious.

825
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:16,480
Aren't you embarrassed to
be surrounded by men like us?

826
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,980
I'm a little embarrassed.

827
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,980
When did she leave?

828
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:29,101
Don't you have a
girlfriend? No, I don't.

829
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,260


830
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,220
Well, I've known her since high school.

831
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,380
I see.

832
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:40,381
That's about it.

833
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,980
I see.

834
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,020
You've never seen her, have you?

835
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
What?

836
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,620
Shut up! Shut up!

837
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,740
Is that so?

838
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,240
Have you ever kissed
her? No, I haven't.

839
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,320
Oh, I see.

840
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,300


841
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,940
Do you have one? I have one.

842
00:58:01,635 --> 00:58:02,635


843
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,040
What about you?

844
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,820
I broke up recently.

845
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:09,790
Oh, I see.

846
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,001
What kind of girl do you like?

847
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,920
I like pretty girls.

848
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
I see.

849
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,740
So you're not the type of old lady like me.

850
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,620
No, I'm not.

851
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,200
No, no, no.

852
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,240
I'm not an old lady.

853
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
You're not an old lady.

854
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,820
I'm an older woman.

855
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,220
No, you're not.

856
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,240
I'm a very beautiful woman.

857
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,620
I wonder how old an old lady is.

858
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:47,860
You're beautiful.

859
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:48,861
It's beautiful.

860
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,630
I'm glad to hear that.

861
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,480
I've been curious about it for a while.

862
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:58,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

863
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,280
It's embarrassing.

864
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
I'm sorry.

865
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,640
No, it's okay.

866
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,980
You don't know what it
means, do you? No, I don't.

867
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,880


868
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,020
Really? Yes, I do.

869
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140


870
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,540
What?

871
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,380
I don't think so.

872
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,670
What's wrong?

873
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,740
Really?

874
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,220
You must be kidding.

875
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,840
No, I'm not.

876
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,780
I see.

877
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
What?

878
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,150
You're standing.

879
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,520
What? I'm sorry.

880
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,080
I'm sorry.

881
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,420


882
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,020
It's a mountain.

883
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,440
It's amazing.

884
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,100
It's big, isn't it?

885
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,300
Is it? It's amazing.

886
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,560
I'm sorry.

887
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,740
It's amazing.

888
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,280


889
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,440
I'm embarrassed.

890
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:05,810
Can I touch it?

891
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:06,920
What?

892
01:00:06,921 --> 01:00:07,921
Can I touch it?

893
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,580
No?

894
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,360
Can I? It's amazing.

895
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:17,040
I've never seen such a big one.

896
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:23,600
Can you stand up and
show me? Really? I see.

897
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
It's amazing.

898
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,400


899
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,580


900
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,100
Aren't you embarrassed?

901
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:35,620
Isn't it too small for
you? If you ask me.

902
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,740
..

903
01:00:37,741 --> 01:00:38,741
It's big.

904
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:39,500
Show me.

905
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,100
I'm smaller than it.

906
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,330
Really?

907
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,520
Yes.

908
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,420
It's more than that.

909
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,300
It's as big as your face.

910
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,340
Great.

911
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,940
I want to see it.

912
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,720
Great.

913
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:03,040
Can I do it with this?

914
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,100
But isn't it a little
big? I'm hiding it.

915
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,840


916
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,880
It's a little hard.

917
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,240
Is it a little hard?

918
01:01:24,925 --> 01:01:26,640
A little, a little.

919
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,710
Hey, lady.

920
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:29,660
What?

921
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:33,500
You're touching it too much.

922
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,560
Wow.

923
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,340
When you're young, you get really stiff.

924
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,480
No, no, no.

925
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,140
Hey, hey, hey. Why are you
taking it off? Hey, hey, hey.

926
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,520


927
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Wow.

928
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,180
It's embarrassing.

929
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,520
Wow.

930
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,800
No, no, no.

931
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,520
I think I saw it.

932
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,220
Please hide it.

933
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,960
I can't.

934
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,480
Why?

935
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,580
Because I'm holding it.

936
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,860
Please don't hide it.

937
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:12,815
Wow.

938
01:02:15,095 --> 01:02:16,095
Wow.

939
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:37,360
It's hard.

940
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:47,080
Have you ever been touched
by a woman? Yes, I have.

941
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,940
Oh, I see.

942
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,940


943
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,450
Wow.

944
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,490
It feels good.

945
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,390
Does it feel good? Yes, it does.

946
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:14,710
Hey, miss.

947
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,060


948
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,320
What?

949
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,880
Are you licking me? No, I'm not.

950
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,421
You're not saying
you don't like it?

951
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,106
No, I'm not saying you don't like it?

952
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,760
You're too big to fit in my mouth.

953
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:45,121
You're too big to fit in my mouth.

954
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,050
You're too big to fit in my mouth.

955
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:57,510
It's so good.

956
01:04:17,835 --> 01:04:18,835
It's so hot.

957
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,590
It's so hot.

958
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:26,950
It's so hot.

959
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:46,690
Ah...

960
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,610
Ah...

961
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
Ah...

962
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:56,060
It feels so good.

963
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:10,976
I'm going to be 100 this year.

964
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:27,880
Wow...

965
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,840
Ah...

966
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,130
It feels so good.

967
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,600
Ah... It's amazing.

968
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:47,520
Ah… Ah… Ah… Ah… I love you.

969
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:55,020



970
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,800
Love… Ah…

971
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,380
Wow, it's amazing.

972
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:33,230
Wow, it's amazing.

973
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,750
It's amazing.

974
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,710
Oh, it's hot.

975
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:55,711
I'll give you some water.

976
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,550
Oh, it's sour.

977
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:41,930
、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、

978
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:43,550
Oh, it's hot.

979
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,220
Your boobs are really big.

980
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,940
What?

981
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,360
Can I touch it?

982
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,780
How is it? It's very soft.

983
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,320
Touch it.

984
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,860
It's very soft.

985
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,860

You are amazing.

989
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,040
Look at this.

990
01:08:48,065 --> 01:08:49,120
You are eating it.

991
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

992
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,900
Wow, it's amazing.

993
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,500
You are soft.

994
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,880
You are amazing.

995
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,660
Please lick my boobies.

996
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,300
Please lick my boobies.

997
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,120
Please lick my boobies.

998
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,236
Do I have to lick your boobies?

999
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:47,780
Do I have to lick your
boobies? Yes, you do.

1000
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,260


1001
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Wow!

1002
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,140
Wow!

1003
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:03,820
Wow!

1004
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,260
Hey, you come here.

1005
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,120
No, I'm fine.

1006
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,020
No, I'm fine.

1007
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,420
Come here.

1008
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,400
Are you OK?

1009
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:22,401
Are you okay?

1010
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,510
It's hot.

1011
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,340
It's amazing.

1012
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,090
I think I got used to it.

1013
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:19,600
Did you get used
to it? Yes, I did.

1014
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:21,140


1015
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,460
Can I have a look?

1016
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,821
It's the first time for you to see it.

1017
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:27,780
Take a good look.

1018
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:30,840
It's amazing.

1019
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:31,841
Wow! Touch me.

1020
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:41,820


1021
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,860
Touch you?

1022
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,180
Yes.

1023
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,621
But... What?

1024
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,740
Can I?

1025
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,220
Yes.

1026
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:54,640
Then...

1027
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,360
Like this.

1028
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:02,385
What's this?

1029
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:17,220
Can I touch you?

1030
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,140
Can I touch you?

1031
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,900
Wow!

1032
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,800
Wow!

1033
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,980
What's this?

1034
01:14:29,981 --> 01:14:31,320
What is this?

1035
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,460
I took it off by mistake.

1036
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:54,110
Stop it.

1037
01:14:56,390 --> 01:15:01,630
Oh, no.

1038
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:24,420
It's amazing.

1039
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,400
It's amazing.

1040
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,280
It's amazing.

1041
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:37,720
It feels good.

1042
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:44,740
It feels good.

1043
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,600
It's amazing.

1044
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,520
Ah! Touch my belly.

1045
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,140
Touch my belly.

1046
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,580


1047
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,820
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1048
01:15:59,845 --> 01:16:00,845
Ah! It feels good.

1049
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:10,600
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1050
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,720
Ah!

1051
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:43,800
Ah! It feels good.

1052
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,860
What should I do? It feels good.

1053
01:16:46,285 --> 01:16:47,285
Here, drink this.

1054
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,840
You want me to drink it?

1055
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,920
Yes.

1056
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,080
What? Hold this.

1057
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:11,570
Wait a minute.

1058
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:14,910


1059
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,550
Ah...

1060
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,630
Mmm.

1061
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,290
Ahh.

1062
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:44,000
Oh... Oh... Mmm... Mmm.

1063
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:46,240
Oh, oh.

1064
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:47,241
Uh, oh.

1065
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,880
Wow!

1066
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,550
Wow!

1067
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,840
Wow!

1068
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,520
Wow! I feel sick.

1069
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,940
Go, go, go.

1070
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,260
Your mouth is.

1071
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,040
..

1072
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,130
I feel sick.

1073
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,840
There, there.

1074
01:20:58,925 --> 01:20:59,980
Go away!

1075
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:19,540
I want my daddy.

1076
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,900
Hurry up and put your hand in.

1077
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,000
I want my daddy.

1078
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,720
Are you sure? Hurry up.

1079
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:33,420


1080
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:42,550
How do you feel?

1081
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,110
It feels so good.

1082
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:45,510
It's your first time, isn't it?

1083
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:53,170
It feels so good.

1084
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:08,720
Is it like this?

1085
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,100
It feels so good.

1086
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:13,090
It feels so good.

1087
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,990
You're so annoying.

1088
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,230
Oh, it's hot.

1089
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,680
Oh, it's hot.

1090
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,380
What's wrong with
you? I have a cramp.

1091
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,320
I'm so tired.

1092
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:40,880


1093
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,220
Oh, my goodness.

1094
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:54,180
Do you feel tired? Yes, I do.

1095
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,840


1096
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:05,570
Oh, my goodness.

1097
01:26:18,310 --> 01:27:02,490
It's 9 o'clock in the morning.

1098
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:07,730
It's 9 o'clock in the morning.

1099
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:09,370
Are you awake?

1100
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:09,510
Huh?

1101
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:10,010
Yes.

1102
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:11,650
Wow.

1103
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,730
Ah.

1104
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,070
Good morning.

1105
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,330
Ah.

1106
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:21,170
Ah.

1107
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:22,890
Ah.

1108
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:23,950
Ah, it feels good.

1109
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:28,640
Ah.

1110
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:29,860
Ah.

1111
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,840
Ah.

1112
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,160
Ah.

1113
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:48,230
Ah.

1114
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:52,340
Ah.

1115
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:53,080
Ah.

1116
01:27:53,081 --> 01:27:53,400
Ah.

1117
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:53,440
Ah.

1118
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,600
Ah.

1119
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:57,030
Ah.

1120
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,760
Oh, it feels good.

1121
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,540
Oh, it's great.

1122
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:43,980
I can't do it.

1123
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,020
Oh, it's great.

1124
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,660
Oh, it's hot.

1125
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:52,860
I'm tired.

1126
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:27,750
I'm tired.

1127
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:28,770
It's hot.

1128
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,080
It's so hot.

1129
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,280
Oh, no!

1130
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:18,880
Oh, no!

1131
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,120
You shouldn't drink so fast.

1132
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,100
You'll spill it.

1133
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,640
Oh, no!

1134
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,120
Oh, no!

1135
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,460
Oh, no!

1136
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:33,480
Oh, no!

1137
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,650
Oh, no! Oh my god.

1138
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:51,760
So delicious.

1139
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,980


1140
01:34:01,085 --> 01:34:15,180
Get some sleep, Shiro-kun.

1141
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,090
Oh, I'm sleepy.

1142
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:59,810
Calm down.

1143
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,600
It's okay.

1144
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,060
I don't want to.

1145
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,400
Let me go.

1146
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,660
It's coming out.

1147
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:51,130
Oh, I'm sleepy.

1148
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:35,310
Ah... Ah...

1149
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,560
Ah...

1150
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:38,885
It's good.

1151
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,070
Ah...

1152
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,640
Ah...

1153
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,200
Ah...

1154
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,200
Ah...

1155
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:53,700
Ah... It was good.

1156
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,660
Ah...

1157
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:57,860
What's wrong? Are you OK?

1158
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,840
I'm so nervous that I can't breathe.

1159
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,740
Thank you for the meal.

1160
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,620
Thank you very much.

1161
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:04,900
See you.

1162
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,590
I should have done it, too.

1163
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:14,810
It was great.

1164
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:15,090
It was great.

1165
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:16,850
It was great.

1166
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:18,350
I should have extended the chance.

1167
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:25,736
It was good to have a graduation trip.

1168
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,380
It was right to come here.

1169
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,560
I want to have a graduation trip.

1170
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,860
What are you going to
do after getting a job?

1171
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,240
I don't want to get a job anymore.

1172
01:38:35,241 --> 01:38:37,940
I want to be a student forever.

1173
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,281
I want to be a student forever.

1174
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,180
Hello.

1175
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,060
May I come in? Please come in.

1176
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,580


1177
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:00,960
She is very beautiful.

1178
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,480
She is very beautiful.

1179
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,240
Are you alone?

1180
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,500
Yes, I came here alone.

1181
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,200
Are you all college
students? Yes, we are.

1182
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,620


1183
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,880
Are you going on a
graduation trip? Yes, we are.

1184
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:17,900
It looks fun.

1185
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,340


1186
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:25,260
Do you often travel alone?

1187
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:26,900
I like traveling alone.

1188
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:27,920
Do you?

1189
01:39:27,921 --> 01:39:28,921
Wow, it's amazing.

1190
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,675
I've been looking around
the store, and it seems

1191
01:39:31,687 --> 01:39:34,220
that there are many
mixed-race people around here.

1192
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,080
It seems so.

1193
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:42,360
We thought it was unusual because we were
mixed-race people, so we came to try it.

1194
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:45,660
Surprisingly, there were no other women.

1195
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,440
Isn't it close?

1196
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,400
Isn't it a little narrow?

1197
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:54,160
We need to use a little more space.

1198
01:39:54,161 --> 01:40:24,140
I don't know if I can use it widely.

1199
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:54,916
I've been looking at it for a long time.

1200
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,820
Isn't the valley dangerous?

1201
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,140
It's very dangerous.

1202
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,480
You've been looking at it for a long time.

1203
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,520
It's dangerous.

1204
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,900
It's not a swimsuit, is it?

1205
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:06,340
Because this is a hot spring.

1206
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:08,540
Does that mean it's completely under that?

1207
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,080
What is that? That is.

1208
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:12,260
..

1209
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:16,580
I've been looking at it for a long time.

1210
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,041
I've been looking at it for a long time.

1211
01:41:19,065 --> 01:41:20,120
It looks very soft.

1212
01:41:20,121 --> 01:41:21,121
Oh, I see.

1213
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,480
Because it's a bath, they enter
naked, don't they? Well, yes, but.

1214
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:27,440
..

1215
01:41:27,441 --> 01:41:29,820
You knew such a woman
would come in, didn't you?

1216
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:33,820
You have a beautiful skin.

1217
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:38,960
You have a beautiful skin.

1218
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,120
You have a beautiful skin, too.

1219
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:46,240
I don't think so.

1220
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,180
You look like you are in your 20s.

1221
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,480
I look like I'm in my teens.

1222
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:57,120
The water is running.

1223
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:00,200
You, too.

1224
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,420
The water is running.

1225
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:04,600
The water is running.

1226
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:08,060
Did you go to the sea after sunbathing?

1227
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:10,640
I went to the sea for a while.

1228
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,540
It's amazing.

1229
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:13,800
It's close.

1230
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,520
I didn't like it.

1231
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,560
You didn't say you didn't like it.

1232
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:22,281
You haven't gone to the bath yet, have you?

1233
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:23,340
Oh!

1234
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,800
Then, how about a little more?

1235
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,700
Do you want to warm up?

1236
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,660
Maybe it's better to stick together.

1237
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,600
If possible, I want to
get along with you more.

1238
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:37,500
If you want to get along with
us, you should wear a towel.

1239
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:38,920
What?

1240
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,440
I don't have a towel.

1241
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,220
Then, what should I do?

1242
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:46,360
Stand up and show me your swimsuit.

1243
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:48,380
Stand up?

1244
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:51,060
What kind of swimsuit did you bring?

1245
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,280
Show me your swimsuit.

1246
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:58,400
If we show you our swimsuit,
will you show it to us?

1247
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,400
You don't have a swimsuit,
so you can't show it to us.

1248
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,120
I want something like a swimsuit.

1249
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:06,260
Something like a swimsuit.

1250
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:08,960
I think it depends on everyone.

1251
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,680
If you show it to us, we'll show it to you.

1252
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,560
What if you let us enjoy your swimsuit?

1253
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:15,841
What should I do if it gets wet?

1254
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,000
It's a little transparent.

1255
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:18,620
Is it fun to look at your
body? It's super fun.

1256
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,380


1257
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,940
Who's going to stand up first?

1258
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:58,860
..

1259
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:05,660
Well, but... Well, but... If you let me
see it, I think I'll show you mine, too.

1260
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:06,500
Oh, really?

1261
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:07,860
I wonder if you'll let me see it, too.

1262
01:44:07,861 --> 01:44:07,940
Oh, my god! Well, but.

1263
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:11,020
..

1264
01:44:11,021 --> 01:44:13,320
Well, but... Who said
they wanted to see it?

1265
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,580
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1266
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,440
Who's the real bachelor?

1267
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:18,520
What?

1268
01:44:18,521 --> 01:44:19,720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1269
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:20,520
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1270
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:22,160
I just did it.

1271
01:44:22,161 --> 01:44:26,500
Oh, no. I'm going to fall.

1272
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:28,400
You're falling.

1273
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,440
Oh, no.

1274
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:32,940
It's broken.

1275
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:36,220
Why are you coming
and going? Oh, no.

1276
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:42,400
I'm so sorry.

1277
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:43,401


1278
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:44,900
You're sweating.

1279
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,340
I'm sorry.

1280
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,640
You couldn't stand up, could you?

1281
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,020
You are amazing.

1282
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,840
What happened to the stain here?

1283
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:06,580
You stained your swimsuit.

1284
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,480
This is the hot spring.

1285
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,980
Are you all right?

1286
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:18,980
Oh, I can see it.

1287
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,100
Oh, I did it.

1288
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,440
I can see the goldfish.

1289
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,040
Oh, no.

1290
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,321
The goldfish has very beautiful nipples.

1291
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:33,600
And the boobs are very beautiful.

1292
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,100
I dropped it.

1293
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,260
I'm in trouble.

1294
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,960
I've scratched it myself.

1295
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:42,720
Show me your teeth.

1296
01:45:42,721 --> 01:45:43,721
No.

1297
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:47,920
I want to brush my teeth.

1298
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,720
Before brushing your
teeth, show me your teeth.

1299
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,540
No.

1300
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:59,100
If I show you my teeth,
can I brush my teeth?

1301
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:00,260
I don't know what to do.

1302
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,120
Wow.

1303
01:46:06,121 --> 01:46:07,480
Wow, that's great!

1304
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:09,320
It must have been hard for you.

1305
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,840
Yes, it was.

1306
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,800
Wow, that's great!

1307
01:46:13,801 --> 01:46:15,300
Wow, you are standing up.

1308
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,400
Look.

1309
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:20,940
You want to touch it,
don't you? Yes, I do.

1310
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,540


1311
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,480
You want to touch it,
don't you? Yes, I do.

1312
01:46:23,481 --> 01:46:26,080
First, touch your own poop.

1313
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,440
Scrub, scrub, scrub.

1314
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:30,140
My own poop? Yes, yes, yes.

1315
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,840
How do you scrub your own poop?

1316
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:35,880
I'll show you how to brush your teeth.

1317
01:46:35,881 --> 01:46:36,881
Wow, you are close!

1318
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:37,960
Wow, you are close!

1319
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:47,660
How do you brush your teeth?

1320
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:50,780
Where do you like to touch?

1321
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,080
You like the tip of your tooth?

1322
01:46:54,675 --> 01:46:56,060
Where else do you like to touch?

1323
01:46:56,061 --> 01:46:57,061
What do you like?

1324
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:59,280
You like rabbits the most, don't you?

1325
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:00,900
What do you like? I like Paris.

1326
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,480


1327
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,240
Do you like Paris?

1328
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:06,770
What else do you
like? I like eggs.

1329
01:47:08,945 --> 01:47:10,640


1330
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:12,380
Do you like eggs?

1331
01:47:13,450 --> 01:47:14,840
You like eggs, don't
you? No, I don't.

1332
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,960


1333
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:21,180
Do you like
everything? Yes, I do.

1334
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,020
All of them feel
good, don't they?

1335
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,480
Why do you feel so good?

1336
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,600
You feel good, don't
you? I'm so happy.

1337
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:36,460
Look at this.

1338
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:43,820


1339
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:49,240
Do you want to touch it?

1340
01:47:49,241 --> 01:47:50,241
Do you want to
touch it? No, I can't.

1341
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,300


1342
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:53,060
Oh, you touched it.

1343
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,980
Look at this.

1344
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:00,220
It's hard.

1345
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,640
It's amazing.

1346
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,060
It's soft.

1347
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,200
It's amazing.

1348
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,400
It's amazing.

1349
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,100
What's wrong with you?

1350
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,100
Are you about to come out?

1351
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:27,420
Oh, it feels good.

1352
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:30,460
We are so kind.

1353
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,180
What's wrong?

1354
01:48:33,985 --> 01:48:36,740
Do you want to be spoiled?

1355
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,360
Can I be spoiled, too?

1356
01:48:39,361 --> 01:48:40,640
There are a lot of mosquitoes.

1357
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,460
Oh, it feels good.

1358
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:49,260
I want to move my tongue more.

1359
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,260
Oh, it feels good.

1360
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:57,560
Oh, it's great.

1361
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:03,500
Oh, it's great.

1362
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:21,020
Oh, my.

1363
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:23,880
It's a pity that I don't have a girlfriend.

1364
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:27,380
I'm so sad. I'm always alone.

1365
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:39,280
Oh, it feels good.

1366
01:49:43,320 --> 01:50:04,800
I'm going to show you a video
of how to clean the cat litter box.

1367
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:14,380
I'm going to show you a video
of how to clean the cat litter box.

1368
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:17,720
I can't stand it anymore.

1369
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:28,260
I can't stand it anymore.

1370
01:50:28,261 --> 01:50:31,480
Do you want me to stop?

1371
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,180
I have to ask you nicely.

1372
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,400
Someone may come.

1373
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,180
Eww, I feel sick to the
bottom of my stomach.

1374
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:51,500
That's not fair to Saki-chan.

1375
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:59,000
Oh dear, you look like you're in pain.

1376
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,600
Oh, no!

1377
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:22,120
You were holding it in
your mouth, weren't you?

1378
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:24,380
Let's do it again.

1379
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:41,560
Come on, come closer.

1380
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:54,880
Oh, my God!

1381
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:03,760
Oh, my God!

1382
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:06,240
Come here and show me more.

1383
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:07,760
Oh, my God! Humming.

1384
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,420


1385
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:31,080
Oh, you got on my nipples.

1386
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:32,520
Oh, really? Yes, yes, yes.

1387
01:52:32,521 --> 01:52:33,521
It feels good.

1388
01:52:33,745 --> 01:52:36,040
Are you standing on
my nipples? I'm jealous.

1389
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,400


1390
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,420
Oh, you're standing on my nipples, too.

1391
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,960
Wow, your nipples are really hard.

1392
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:45,040
Oh, it feels good.

1393
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,460
Oh, it feels good.

01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,840
Oh, it feels good.

1396
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,420
Oh, it feels good.

1397
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:02,320
Oh, it feels good.

1398
01:53:02,321 --> 01:53:03,340
Oh, it feels good.

1399
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:07,580

Oh, it feels good.

1403
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:12,300
Oh, it feels good.

1404
01:53:12,301 --> 01:53:13,301
Oh, it's wet.

1405
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:14,920
Really? Let me see.

1406
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,060
I want to see.

1407
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,460


1408
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,680
What is it? It's a puss.

1409
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:19,860
It's a puss?

1410
01:53:19,861 --> 01:53:22,100
What are you going to do when
you see a puss? I don't know.

1411
01:53:22,101 --> 01:53:23,101


1412
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:28,760
It's a good puss.

It's a good puss.

1414
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,160

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1418

Your legs are moving.

Yes, they are.

1439

You feel good, don't you?

1440
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:15,130
Your nipples are moving, too.

1441
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,180
I'm sorry.

You are so cute.

1469

Wow, you can take it out again.

1470
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:59,590
You can take it out a lot
because you are a baby.

1471
01:57:59,591 --> 01:58:00,770
It feels good.

1472

01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:05,080
Don't do that, In-chan.

I'm going to go.

1496
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:29,080
Mom, I can't stand it.

1497
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,760
You can't stand it anymore.

1498
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:35,440
You can do it.

1499
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:37,740
Oh my god!

1500
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:38,400
Oh my god!

I feel so good! It's so hot.

1509
02:01:05,151 --> 02:01:08,490
I don't want to look at it.

1510
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:10,130
I don't want to look at it.

1511
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:14,170
It's hard to breathe.

1512
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:26,070
My chest feels good.

1513
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:29,790
I'm thirsty.

1514

02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:35,790
I'm going to be caught.

1517
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:45,950
I'm going to be caught.

Ah, it's hot.

1522
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:54,990
It's not good.

1523
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:14,750


1524
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:19,030
What's wrong? I'm sorry.

You are so big!

02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:15,140
Here comes Teki-chan.

1546
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:17,480
Oh, it feels good!

Oh, your belly is so comfortable!

1549
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:23,960
Please use your belly a lot.

1550
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,720
Yes!

1551
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:27,280
Oh, it feels good!

Ah, it's cold.

It's cold.

02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:51,140


1557
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:54,900
My shoulders are cold.

1558
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:47,231
The baby's mother is crying.

1559
02:06:50,830 --> 02:06:58,360
Do you still want more?

1560
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,060
Do you still want more?

1561
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,720
It's so good!

1562
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:34,260
Did you get wet?

1563
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:39,440
You're soaking wet.

1564
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,640
You are so wet.

1565
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:52,740
You want to have a lot of sex, don't you?

1566
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:02,540
I'll do something good for you next time.

1567
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:05,540
You are so wet.

1568
02:09:12,325 --> 02:09:13,780
You are always stiff, aren't you?

1569
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:15,680
You are getting sleepy, aren't you?

1570
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:16,800
You feel good, don't you?

1571
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:17,920
You want to go, don't you?

1572
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:19,291
You are showing off a lot.

1573
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:23,260
Oh, no!

1574
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,340
What's going to happen?

1575
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:26,640
Oh, no!

1576
02:09:26,641 --> 02:09:27,240
Oh, no!

1577
02:09:27,290 --> 02:09:28,290
Did you explode?

1578
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:33,520
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1579
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,780
Oh, no!

1580

Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1581
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,160
Go! Go! Go!

1582
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:47,960
Oh, you have a very dark one.

1583
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:53,400
You have a very dark one.

1584
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:59,491
Do you want to do it more?

1585
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:19,250
Wow, it's amazing.

1586
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:41,760
It's amazing.

1587
02:10:41,761 --> 02:10:42,801
It feels good, doesn't
it? It's amazing.

1588
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,840


1589
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:50,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1590
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:52,600
It feels good, doesn't
it? I feel so good.

1591
02:10:52,601 --> 02:11:01,560
I feel so good.

1592
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:16,440
I feel so good.

1593
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:36,450


1594
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:41,730
I can't allow myself to be in pain.

1595
02:11:41,731 --> 02:11:44,850
I can't.

1596
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,560
I can't.

1597
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:01,960
I can't.

1598
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:03,420
I can't.

1599
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:05,360
I can't.

1600
02:12:05,361 --> 02:12:06,361
I can't.

1601
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:08,000
I can't.

1602
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:11,700
I'm sorry.

1603
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:16,480
I'm sorry.

1604
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:19,720
I'm sorry.

1605
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:56,570
I'm going to sleep.

1606
02:12:58,855 --> 02:13:02,050
Oh, no!

1607
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:08,050
I'm going to sleep.

1608
02:13:08,710 --> 02:13:12,930
It feels good.

1609
02:13:14,150 --> 02:13:23,760
It feels good.

1610
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:40,770
I'm going to sleep.

1611
02:14:22,180 --> 02:14:23,180
Oh, no! I'm so tired.

1612
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:40,560


1613
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:45,920
I've never had such a hard time.

1614
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:58,820
Oh, no. What
happened to me? Oh, no.

1615
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:08,140
I'm sweating.

1616
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,760
Oh, no. I'm sweating.

1617
02:15:12,761 --> 02:15:14,040
Oh, no!

1618
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:11,940
Oh, no! I can't get up.

1619
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:13,640
I'm soaked.

1620
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:02,720
It was great.

1621
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:11,940
Thank you.

1622
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,600


1623
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:33,010
I'm so satisfied.

1624
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:42,670
You guys were great.

1625
02:17:43,730 --> 02:17:45,150
Thank you so much.

1626
02:17:47,150 --> 02:17:48,330
I left my towel somewhere.

1627
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:52,570
See you later.
