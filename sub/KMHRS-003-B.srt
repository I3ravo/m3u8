1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The hole in the butt is sticking out to the ceiling, isn't it?

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's a little close, isn't it?

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You have a beautiful skin.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to touch you.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I can't stand it.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What should I do? I'm getting goosebumps.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What kind of face are you making?

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm embarrassed.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Next time, it will be an M-shape.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The M-shape is not beautiful at all.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's wet.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's soaked.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not in your underwear.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's in there.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is there a place where it can get in?

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is it?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What do you call it?

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Manco.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I wonder if it will be in the movie.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I can see something.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Show me.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Put your hand behind your head and stick out your thumb.

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How long has it been since you got out of the hospital?

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How long has it been since I got out of the hospital?

27
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

28
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Please lick it.

29
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It tastes like Mito-chan.

30
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The taste of mango is different depending on the woman.

31
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The taste of Hito-chan is rich.

32
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't move your legs.

33
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Spread your legs more.

34
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Stretch your back.

35
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you know that you've come all the way to the entrance?

36
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Tell me that you'll be born when you get out of here.

37
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's how much fun it is.

38
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll be born.

39
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You'll be born.

40
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to be born.

41
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Not yet.

42
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're going to be born from a manhole.

43
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm going to be born from a mango.

44
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You've done a lot of things you've never done before.

45
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It feels so good.

46
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Come here.

47
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go to bed.

48
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Which one do you prefer?

49
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The round one or the straight one?

50
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Show me your right hand.

51
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you understand?

52
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, I understand.

53
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to pat you on the back

54
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't hide your face.

55
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Where is your boobs?

56
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

57
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're filming it, aren't you?

58
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

59
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're filming it, aren't you?

60
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I want to see how you feel, Mito-chan.

61
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Show it to me.

62
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Roll it up a little.

63
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Push it up a little.

64
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I want to see how you feel.

65
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I feel good.

66
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I feel good.

67
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Take it easy.

68
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You'll be fine.

69
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't say anything.

70
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I feel good.

71
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I feel good.

72
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I feel so good.

73
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's not a big deal.

74
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I feel so good.

75
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I feel so good.

76
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I feel so good.

77
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't cry.

78
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't cry.

79
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't cry.

80
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What is this?

81
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What is this?

82
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Give me some candy.

83
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why are you so small?

85
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're big.

86
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What's the matter?

87
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Will you come in?

88
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What's in there?

89
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What's in there?

90
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What?

91
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Your father's.

92
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Father's?

93
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Ok, your father's in there.

94
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

95
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

96
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A lot of men are watching this.

97
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's raining.

98
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm giving you a massage now.

99
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm giving you a massage now.

100
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What kind of massage?

101
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Big one.

102
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Mito-chan, you are not a college student, you are a senior high school student.

103
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Which one do you want to do?

107
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Which one do you want to do?

108
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Which one do you want to do?

109
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Don't speak with your face

110
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's okay, just the tongue

111
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

112
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll give you a kiss.

113
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Please eat while looking at the camera.

114
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's not in your mouth.

116
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm going to eat a little more.

117
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm going to eat a little more.

118
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm going to do the most embarrassing thing from now on.

119
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What do you think it is?

120
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What? What are you going to do?

121
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll put your blood in your belly.

122
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Please give me your blood.

123
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Please give me your blood.

124
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Where?

125
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It feels good.

126
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Feels good?

127
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Feels good?

128
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm not sure what to say, but I'm a little bit sad.

129
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What are you doing now?

137
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What are you doing now?

138
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It hurts.

139
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
What are you doing now?

140
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I feel like I'm in a hospital.

141
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Do you feel good?

142
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes, I feel good.

143
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Do you feel good?

144
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I love you.

145
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Where are you?

146
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Tell me

147
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm inside

148
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm inside

149
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Where are you?

150
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm inside

151
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm inside

152
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It hurts.

153
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
How deep is it?

154
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Just a little more.

155
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
How deep is it?

156
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
How deep is it?

157
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
How deep is it?

158
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It feels good...

159
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It feels good...

160
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
How do you feel?

161
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
How do you feel?

162
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I felt good.

163
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Do you feel different from before?

164
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
How do you feel?

165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It was a strange feeling, but it felt good.

166
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you starting to like it?

167
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes.

168
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'll change this.

169
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Do you want to see?

170
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What do you usually do?

171
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't do this at all.

172
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What color do you wear?

173
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
White.

174
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You don't wear this?

175
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I can't.

176
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't like it.

177
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Show me.

178
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I wonder if it was cut properly

179
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
In the back

180
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

181
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'll do more nasty things for you.

182
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm going to lie down on the floor and lie down on the floor and lie down on the floor and lie down on the floor.

183
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You know what sound it is, don't you?

184
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The next man will come and feel good alone.

185
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I will be with you.

186
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I will be with you.

187
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I will be with you.

188
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I will be with you.

189
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I will be with you.

190
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I will be with you.

191
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Let's wait until you feel better alone.

192
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Wait a minute.

193
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You have a good body.

194
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Your skin is clean.

195
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That's right.

196
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But it's okay, isn't it?

197
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You're licking your face.

198
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Don't cry.

199
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You want to cry more, don't you?

200
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What's wrong?

201
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Please look at this

202
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
What is this?

203
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's the same, isn't it?

204
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You want me to wet you?

205
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You have a flat neck

206
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm sorry for what I said.

207
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
What are you doing?

209
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You're being sucked in, aren't you?

210
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
What?

211
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
What are you saying?

212
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
My neck is being pulled.

213
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Do you know what this is?

214
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
What is this?

215
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I don't know.

216
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I don't know.

217
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Open your eyes.

218
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I don't know.

219
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Do you want me to give you a hint?

221
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No.

222
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's the one from the West.

223
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
The one where a man does this.

224
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What's this?

225
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I'll give you two hints.

226
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You're moving your hands, aren't you?

227
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You're moving your hands, aren't you?

228
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It's the same day, isn't it?

229
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Tell me.

230
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Are you small?

231
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
What's wrong?

232
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Don't lick it yet.

233
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Is it okay to just lick it?

234
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I want to lick you.

235
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I'll do it.

236
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,300
Leave me alone, please.

237
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,300
Yes, yes.

238
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,300
Do you want to see how big it is?

239
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
Open your eyes.

240
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,300
How big is it?

241
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,300
It's big, big, big.

242
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,300
It's the same size as your face.

243
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:08,300
You can't run away from me, can you?

244
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,300
You can't run away from me, can you?

245
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,300
You can't run away from me, can you?

246
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,300
It's okay.

247
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,300
It's really important.

248
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
Relax.

249
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,300
What's wrong with you?

250
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,300
What's wrong with you?

251
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,300
Yes.

252
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,300
Do you want to feel good?

253
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
Yes.

254
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,300
You don't feel good?

255
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,300
No.

256
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Are you interested?

257
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,300
I'm going to attack you.

258
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Sit down.

259
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,300
Sit down.

260
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,300
It's morning.

261
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,300
Does it feel good?

262
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,300
It feels good.

263
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,300
It feels good.

264
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,300
?

265
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,300
?

266
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:06,300
?

267
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,300
?

268
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,300
?

269
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
I want to go.

270
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,300
You want to go?

271
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,300
I want to go.

272
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,300
You want to go?

273
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,300
Open your eyes and see yourself.

274
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,300
Come back tomorrow.

275
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,300
I told you to come back.

276
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

277
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,300
Please let me go

278
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,300
Please let me go

279
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,300
Please let me go

280
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,300
Look at me more

281
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,300
Please let me go

282
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,300
What happened?

283
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,300
What happened to your finger?

284
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,300
What happened to your finger?

285
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,300
It's in there

286
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Are you okay?

287
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,300
I'm sorry I shook you.

288
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,300
I'm sorry.

289
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,300
I'm sorry.

290
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,300
Are you okay?

291
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Show me.

292
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,300
I'm sorry.

293
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,300
Oh, that's amazing.

294
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,300
What is this?

295
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,300
Look at this.

296
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,300
Let me see your eyes.

297
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,300
Let me see.

298
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,300
You have a good eye.

299
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,300
The taste has changed.

300
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,300
You are so kind.

301
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:52,300
I want to kiss you.

302
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:29,300
You're doing this to your ex-girlfriend?

303
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,300
You've gained some experience.

304
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,300
Does it feel good?

305
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
Are you enjoying it?

306
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,300
Yeah.

307
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,300
Come here.

308
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,300
Sit down.

309
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,300
Let's do it one more time.

310
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,300
It's okay.

311
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,300
It's warm.

312
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,300
It's warm.

313
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,300
It's okay.

314
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,300
It's okay.

315
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,300
It's okay.

316
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,300
You want me to put it in?

317
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,300
You want me to put it in?

318
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,300
You want me to put it in?

319
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,300
Are you okay?

320
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,240
Looks like you don't come back...

321
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,340
You can go back to graduate school

322
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,280
for 1 month

323
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,280
and does your homework

324
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,300
luxury drama

325
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,320
for about 3 months

326
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,360
I've been doing that all the time

327
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,360
Can you put your feet in?

328
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,360
I feel like I'm about to cry.

329
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,360
How do you feel?

330
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,360
I feel like I'm about to cry.

331
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,360
It hurts.

332
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,360
I want to get out of here.

333
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,360
Oh, it feels good.

334
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,360
I want to sleep from the back.

335
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,360
I'm going to push you out.

336
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,360
I'm sorry.

337
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,360
I found a good one.

338
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,360
Wait a minute.

339
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Have you ever done that before?

340
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,360
No.

341
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,360
I'm sorry.

342
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,360
Close your eyes.

343
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,360
What are you doing?

344
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,360
Look at me.

345
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,360
What are you doing with the first person you met?

346
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,360
I'm doing it with Tetsu.

347
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:56,360
It's the first time I've ever seen my own face.

348
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,360
What's wrong with you?

349
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,360
Let's get out of here.

350
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,360
Let's get out of here.

351
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,360
Oh, my God.

352
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,360
Look at your face.

353
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,360
It's okay.

354
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,360
It's okay.

355
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,360
It's okay.

356
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,360
Oh, it's good.

357
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,360
Oh, it's good.

358
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,360
Come here.

359
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,360
Come here.

360
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Come here.

361
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,360
Please look at me.

362
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,360
I'm sorry.

363
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,360
Are you okay?

364
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,360
Are you okay?

365
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,360
Look over there.

366
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,360
Are you okay?

367
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,360
Are you okay?

368
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,360
What's wrong with you?

369
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,360
Are you okay?

370
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,360
What's wrong with you?

371
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,360
What's wrong with you?

372
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,360
ah

373
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,360
ah

374
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,360
ah

375
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,360
ah

376
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,360
ah

377
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,360
ah

378
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,360
ah

379
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,360
ah

380
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,360
It feels good

381
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,360
ah

382
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,360
ah

383
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,360
Hmm?

384
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,360
What happened?

385
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,360
It's so hot in here.

386
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:55,360
Kuro inside the house

387
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:33,360
After the shooting, I came out of the hotel.

388
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,360
I'm a little dizzy.

389
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:49,360
In the last shooting, I was in a state that I didn't understand well.

390
01:17:49,360 --> 01:18:04,360
This time, I was able to get a lot of food from the actors and actresses, and I was able to have a good time.

391
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:18,360
I was hungry and wanted to eat something, but I was so hungry that I fell asleep right away when I got home.

392
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:27,360
I think I got used to this place.

393
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Thank you.

394
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Good night!

395
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,360
Thank you for watching!
