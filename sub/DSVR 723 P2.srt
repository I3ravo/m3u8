1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,370
It felt so good.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,930
What?

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,090
It was so close.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,730
Did you get wet? Yes, I did.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,430


6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,010
Where should I
go next? This way.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,410
It's so good.

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,450
It looks fun.

9
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:20,990


10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm going to take a bath.

11
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:34,321
I'm going to take a bath.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,340
Wow!

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,490
It's so beautiful.

14
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:58,180
It's great.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,100
It's great, isn't it?

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,460
It was really good.

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,240
What was good? The shower.

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,260


19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,840
Really?

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,060
It was the best.

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,100
It was so refreshing.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,980
No way! It was so soft.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,180


24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,180
But you were panting a lot.

25
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,181
You did it! It's good.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,700


27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,300
It's good? It's good.

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:36,980


29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:37,840
What?

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,980
Maybe it's because it's a hammock,

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,420
so it's still a bit out of tune.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
It's still out of tune?

33
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
Can you still do it?

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
You did it a lot earlier.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
What?

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,480
Wow!

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
You did it!

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,480
You did it! It's good.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700


40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Yes.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,740
Okay, here we go.

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Yes.

43
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:21,220
I'm not good at it.

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,900
Oh, no. I'm not good at it.

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,670
Are you a newbie?

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Are you enjoying it?

47
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,700
Oh, well, it's going to be a lot better.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,700
What? Wait a minute.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,920
What? Did you just kiss me and
you're so excited? That's crazy.

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060


51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,800
You look like you're having a lot of fun.

52
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,801
I'm going to sleep.

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,640
What?

54
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm going to sleep.

55
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:40,570
It's difficult to go back there.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Hello.

57
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:21,910
Hello.

58
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,350
I'm here.

59
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:23,930
Hi.

60
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,650
I'm here.

61
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:25,651
What? You look too happy.

62
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,630
What are we doing here?

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,441
I heard you guys were doing great.

64
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,650
Yeah, we were.

65
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,430
How many times did you
release the album? Just once.

66
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,670
Just once?

67
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,890
But you guys were so good.

68
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:42,990
Yeah, I was so sleepy just a
while ago because I took a nap.

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,690
Chogito, what are you doing?

70
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,290
Why? I don't care.

71
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,210
What are you
doing? Don't do that.

72
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,670


73
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,540
Chikubi, do you like it?

74
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,270
Oh, something is coming.

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,850
What?

76
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:08,851
Oh, what?

77
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,330
Oh, a lot of people are here.

78
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,490
We're back.

79
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,390
Hi, Tomo.

80
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,890
We're back.

81
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,890
What happened to you?

82
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
You look like a humanoid.

83
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,470
Wow, Ichikun is also very big.

84
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,770
You look like a humanoid.

85
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,230
I can't do it.

86
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,490
Show me your neck.

87
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,270
I'm so happy to see you.

88
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,210
I'm so happy to see you.

89
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,030
I'm so happy to see you.

90
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,930
I'm weak to damage.

91
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,290
I feel good.

92
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,190
I'm sleepy.

93
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
I want to sleep a lot.

94
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,920
I want to play with Koichi.

95
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:36,410
I wonder if he is sleeping.

96
00:06:50,690 --> 00:07:01,760
This is a video of a child
who was doing a handstand.

97
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,380
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,690
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,910
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,180
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,020
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:26,660
What? Can't you bear it?

114
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,200
I want to get angry soon.

115
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:31,201
It's fun, isn't it? Let's do it.

116
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Wait a minute.

117
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:09,680


118
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,560
I thought I was going to die.

119
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,730
I'm going to touch your mouth.

120
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:29,460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, wow.

122
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:46,530
Oh, my God.

123
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,550
Oh, my God.

124
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,830
Oh, my God.

125
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I'll touch your mouth.

126
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,620
Oh, it feels good.

127
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Come on, kiss me.

128
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,380
Yes, it is.

129
00:14:48,860 --> 00:15:55,890
Oh, you can touch the side.

130
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,270
No, I can't.

131
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,150
Oh, you can't.

132
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:03,290
Oh, you can't.

133
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,910
What are you doing?

134
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,770
What are you
doing? Oh, you can't.

135
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,390
Oh, you can't.

136
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:18,840
Oh, you can't.

137
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,510
Oh, you can't.

138
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,890


139
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,360
I remember a lot.

140
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
This and this.

141
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Do you like mine?

142
00:19:36,470 --> 00:21:42,120
What are you doing?

143
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,920
What a mess! I feel so good.

144
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,800


145
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
You feel so good?
I feel so good.

146
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,100
I feel so good.

147
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:37,520


148
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
I don't like her.

149
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,100
Let's have a break.

150
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Let's go.

151
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Come here.
