1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
P.S. This is P.P.K System.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,960
In Ginpachi,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:19,440
they say that what anyone has it is a

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,440
My wife's precious mouth and manko are covered with a penis.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,440
It looks like a skewer.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
My wife is treated as a scoundrel.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,440
It looks like a Dutch wife.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:50,440
I'm so excited.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,440
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Actually, I've been hiding something.

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,440
What is it?

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Actually, I have a special sexual habit.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Sexual habit?

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Do you know what a sexual habit is?

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,440
A sexual habit?

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,440
It means being cheated on?

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Yes.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,440
It's close to that.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:55,440
My wife gets excited when she sees another man being cheated on.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Are you getting excited?

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,440
Yes.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:19,440
If I cheat on someone, am I getting excited?

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I think she gets jealous.

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,440
No, I'm not jealous.

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm just a pervert.

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,440
I see.

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,440
You don't like me anymore?

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I don't like you.

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I was surprised.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,440
That's right.

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Why did you say that?

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,440
I wish you could keep quiet.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I think so, but it's not good to hide it between couples.

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,440
I was surprised.

35
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:38,440
What do you think if I ask you to have sex with another man?

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,440
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm serious.

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,440
That's impossible.

39
00:03:50,440 --> 00:04:00,440
We only have sex once every three months.

40
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Are you satisfied with that?

41
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,440
It's none of your business.

42
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,440
That's right.

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I'm suffering because I don't want to do it.

44
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Then, why don't you do it for me every day?

45
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I can't.

46
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Why?

47
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,440
I can't get excited without you.

48
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,440
I don't know what you mean.

49
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Can you have sex with another man?

50
00:04:50,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I want to hug you.

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm thirsty.

52
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
What do you want?

53
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Water.

54
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Water.

55
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:44,440
You're upset.

56
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Yes.

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I want to take back what's important to me.

58
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
That's how I feel.

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
I don't want to take away Kana.

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Please understand my feelings.

61
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Men are complicated.

62
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:39,440
It's not easy to understand.

63
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I'll try to understand.

64
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:57,440
I see.

65
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,440
That's all for today.

66
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:23,440
I have to pack the laundry.

67
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Please take a look.

68
00:07:42,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Thank you very much.

69
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Thank you.

70
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Nice to meet you.

71
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Nice to meet you.

72
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
My name is Osaki.

73
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
This is Kanae.

74
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Nice to meet you.

75
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Welcome.

76
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Do you want coffee?

77
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
How about you?

78
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Same.

79
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Thank you.

80
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,440
I saw him several times on the Internet.

81
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
He understands our situation.

82
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Don't worry.

83
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I understand your feelings.

84
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,440
At first, my wife was just a child.

85
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
If I brought my wife today,

86
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
she would be relieved.

87
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,440
But now she's pregnant.

88
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
I see.

89
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
You're beautiful.

90
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Thank you.

91
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Do you often go shopping with your wife?

92
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Not really.

93
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I see.

94
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,440
When you go shopping,

95
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:52,440
you become more and more friendly.

96
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Is that so?

97
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
There aren't many stores

98
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,440
that sell orange-colored bags like this.

99
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,440
I see.

100
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Let's have a drink.

101
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Let's have a toast.

102
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Here you are.

103
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Sit in the middle.

104
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Let's have a toast.

105
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Let's have a toast.

106
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Actually,

107
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
I didn't show you this picture.

108
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,440
This is a picture of Chiba.

109
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Wow.

110
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Isn't it amazing?

111
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Can I be like this?

112
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
That's right.

113
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,440
I don't know who you are.

114
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Oh, right.

115
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
There's a DVD, too.

116
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I'll bring it.

117
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Let's watch it together.

118
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:53,440
DVD.

119
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Wow.

120
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
This is amazing.

121
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:25,440
This is amazing.

122
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Come here.

123
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,440
It's pretty lively.

124
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,440
That's right.

125
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
This is my wife.

126
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:58,440
This is amazing.

127
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Isn't it nice?

128
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Yes.

129
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,440
It's amazing.

130
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:26,440
This face is amazing.

131
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:48,440
This is amazing.


368
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Please come in.

369
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,440
Thank you.

370
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,440
Please come in.

371
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,440
Please come in.

372
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,440
Thank you.

373
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,440
Please use whatever you have in this room freely.

374
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,440
If you are hungry, there is a kitchen in the back.

375
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,440
There are many things in the fridge.

376
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,440
There are many beds in the futon.

377
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,440
There is a bed in the back.

378
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,440
Please use it freely.

379
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,440
Thank you.

380
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,440
There is a bath.

381
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,440
It is always open.

382
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,440
You can use it anytime.

383
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,440
You can use it anytime.

384
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,440
It's not a hot spring, but it feels good to take a bath in the afternoon.

385
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,440
Thank you.

386
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,440
It's free time until dinner time.

387
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,440
Please relax.

388
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,440
Thank you.

389
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,440
Please come in.

390
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,440
Hello.

391
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,440
Thank you.

392
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,440
You are very good at it.

393
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,440
I see.

394
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,440
Let's take a bath.

395
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,440
Okay.

396
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,440
Let's go.


400
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,440
It feels good.

401
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,440
Let's go.

402
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,440
I wonder how it will be.

403
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,440
It's a great place.

404
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,440
I agree.

407
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,440
Thank you.

408
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:53,440
The weather is good today.

409
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,440
Let's go.

410
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,440
May I come in?

411
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,440
Yes.

412
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:29,440
Let's go.

413
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,440
Let's go.

414
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,440
Let's go.

415
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,440
Let's go.

416
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,440
Let's go.

417
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,440
Let's go.

418
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,440
Let's go.

419
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,440
It's fresh.

420
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,440
It's clean.

428
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

429
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,440
It's okay

430
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,440
It's okay

431
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,440
Don't worry

432
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,440
It's okay

433
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,440
It's okay

434
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,440
It's okay

435
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,440
It's okay

436
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:16,440
It's okay

437
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,440
Come on, come here

438
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,440
Come here

439
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,440
Here

440
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,440
It's okay

441
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,440
OK

442
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,440
I want to touch you

443
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,440
Here

463
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:14,920
It may be that Silence paths may die in, but even a person who knows the meaning of seeing YouTube,

464
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:24,560
I can't put it on my table, so...

465
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,560
Come here

466
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,480
Don't get scared.

467
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,360
She's here!

468
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,560
What do you mean?

469
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,020
Come on...

470
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,020
I'm sorry.

471
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,020
I'm sorry.

472
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,020
It's not enough.

473
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,020
It's not enough.

474
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,020
Let's continue.

475
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,020
I'm sorry.

476
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,020
Hey, madam.

477
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:04,020
I'm sorry.

478
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:16,020
I'm sorry.

479
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:40,020
I was surprised that it suddenly rolled over.

480
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,020
I see.

481
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,020
I can't stand it now.

482
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:57,020
I'm sorry.

483
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,020
Thank you.

484
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,020
Hey, look.

485
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:14,020
It's yours.

486
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,020
What?

487
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,020
What is this?

488
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,020
This is definitely yours.

489
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:44,020
I'm sorry.

490
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:59,020
I'm going to get a drink.

491
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,020
Here you are.

492
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:48,020
Here you are.

493
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:56,020
It's an edgy costume.

494
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:59,020
That's right.

495
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:27,020
Here you are.

496
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:30,020
I'm sorry.

497
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:44,020
I enjoyed the bath right away.

498
01:34:44,020 --> 01:35:12,020
This is the best result for us.

499
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:33,020
I can't stand it anymore.

500
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,020
I'm sorry.

501
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,020
Thank you.

502
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,020
Thank you.

503
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:46,020
It hurts too much, this place.

504
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:13,020
I'm sorry.

510
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:54,020
Hoshikawa, I'm sorry.

511
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,020
Don't worry.

512
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,020
She's very excited.

513
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:03,020
She's a good girl.

514
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:07,020
She's wonderful.

515
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:16,020
Hoshikawa, you're beautiful.

516
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:20,020
Her costume is wonderful.

517
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:26,020
You did it with your husband last night, didn't you?

518
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:28,020
Yes.

519
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:34,020
You must have been excited to do it.

520
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,020
Yes.

521
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,020
It looks like this.

522
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:48,020
There's nothing in here, but this villa is fun, isn't it?

523
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:52,020
Please be satisfied.

524
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:57,020
Madam, I can feel it.

525
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:01,020
It's amazing.

526
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:06,020
Look at her.

527
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:12,020
It's hot inside.

528
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:17,020
Madam, it's getting hot.

529
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:22,020
Madam, you're such a good girl.

530
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,020
It's amazing that it's hot inside.

531
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,020
Madam, it's getting hot inside.

532
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:29,020
She doesn't like it.

533
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:31,020
She doesn't like it.

534
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,020
It's getting hotter.

535
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:38,020
It's getting hotter.

536
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,020
Look at your husband's face.

537
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:47,020
He's smiling.

538
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:52,020
Madam, it's getting hotter.

539
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:55,020
It's getting hotter.

540
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:01,020
Madam, you're teaching Sado, aren't you?

541
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,020
Yes.

542
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,020
What are you teaching your students?

543
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,020
What?

544
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:11,020
Madam, please tell them.

545
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:21,020
I'm teaching them how to make tea.

546
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,020
How to make tea.

551
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,020
Poem.

552
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:47,020
Help.

553
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:50,020
Help.

554
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:50,020
Please help.

555
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,020
Not bad.

556
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,020
Please help.

557
01:39:56,020 --> 01:40:04,020
Love.

558
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,020
Don't tease me like that.

559
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:37,020
What's going on?

560
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:52,020
What's wrong?

561
01:40:52,020 --> 01:41:02,020
I can't do it anymore.
