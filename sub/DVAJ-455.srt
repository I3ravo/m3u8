1
22.38 --> 24.38
 It looks delicious.

2
24.38 --> 26.38
 I'll take a picture with my phone.

3
28.38 --> 30.38
 Can I take a picture?

4
32.38 --> 34.38
 You like it, don't you?

5
34.38 --> 36.38
 Are you drinking?

6
36.38 --> 38.38
 I'll take a picture.

7
38.38 --> 40.38
 I'm already drunk.

8
42.38 --> 44.38
 I'm drinking this.

9
44.38 --> 46.38
 Thank you very much.

10
46.38 --> 48.38
 You did it.

11
50.38 --> 52.38
 I was surprised.

12
54.38 --> 56.38
 I was surprised.

13
58.38 --> 60.38
 Are you eating?

14
66.38 --> 68.38
 Are you eating?

15
68.38 --> 70.38
 I'm eating.

16
70.38 --> 72.38
 I'll eat this.

17
72.38 --> 74.38
 Thank you very much.

18
76.38 --> 78.38
 This is delicious.

19
78.38 --> 80.38
 Face the camera.

20
80.38 --> 82.38
 Who is it?

21
82.38 --> 84.38
 Is it you?

22
86.38 --> 88.38
 5 people.

23
88.38 --> 90.38
 It's impossible.

24
90.38 --> 92.38
 It's impossible.

25
92.38 --> 94.38
 It's impossible.

26
98.38 --> 100.38
 The two people who won rock-paper-scissors.

27
102.38 --> 104.38
 I'll eat this.

28
106.38 --> 107.38
 Wow.

29
107.38 --> 109.38
 What? Is it starting?

30
109.38 --> 111.38
 It's starting.

31
111.38 --> 113.38
 It's starting.

32
114.38 --> 116.38
 It's starting.

33
116.38 --> 117.38
 Are you streaming?

34
117.38 --> 118.38
 Are you streaming?

35
118.38 --> 120.38
 I'm streaming.

36
120.38 --> 122.38
 Oh my gosh.

37
122.38 --> 124.38
 There's something in the middle.

38
124.38 --> 126.38
 What is this?

39
126.38 --> 128.38
 It's a fish.

40
131.38 --> 133.38
 I can't move.

41
133.38 --> 135.38
 Is it grilled meat?

42
135.38 --> 137.38
 Miki, you can't eat it.

43
137.38 --> 139.38
 It's good.

44
139.38 --> 141.38
 Wow.

45
141.38 --> 143.38
 I did it.

46
153.38 --> 155.38
 It's burning.

47
157.38 --> 159.38
 I'm eating meat.

48
159.38 --> 166.28
 You can't eat meat.

49
166.28 --> 168.28
 I'm eating green pepper.

50
168.28 --> 170.28
 You hate green pepper.

51
170.28 --> 172.28
 Let's eat green pepper.

52
172.28 --> 174.28
 Don't come close to me.

53
174.28 --> 176.28
 What?

54
178.28 --> 180.28
 It's cold.

55
180.28 --> 182.28
 It's cold.

56
184.28 --> 186.28
 There's something.

57
186.28 --> 188.28
 Come closer to me.

58
188.28 --> 190.28
 Come closer to me.

59
190.28 --> 192.28
 It's hot.

60
192.28 --> 194.28
 It's hot.

61
196.28 --> 198.28
 I'll bring the one that is open.

62
198.28 --> 200.28
 It's because of the wind.

63
200.28 --> 202.28
 It's hot.

64
202.28 --> 204.28
 It's hot.

65
204.28 --> 206.28
 It's not hot.

66
206.28 --> 208.28
 It's good.

67
208.28 --> 263.66
 Miki, you're going to eat this, right?

68
263.66 --> 270.75
 Where are you going?

69
270.75 --> 272.75
 I'm going to do this.

70
272.75 --> 274.75
 What are you saying?

71
274.75 --> 276.75
 Stop it.

72
279.38 --> 281.38
 It's not good.

73
287.10 --> 289.10
 I won't do it.

74
289.10 --> 291.10
 I don't want to do it.

75
293.10 --> 295.10
 Come closer to me.

76
296.10 --> 298.10
 I'm sleepy.

77
298.10 --> 371.17
 I'm going to do it.

78
371.17 --> 374.86
 Hajime, wake up.

79
374.86 --> 376.86
 Hajime.

80
376.86 --> 378.86
 Do you want me to leave the key?

81
378.86 --> 382.75
 Let's go eat.

82
382.75 --> 384.75
 He's sleeping.

83
384.75 --> 386.75
 Aren't you hungry?

84
390.75 --> 392.75
 Let's go.

85
402.75 --> 404.75
 Where are you going?

86
404.75 --> 406.75
 I'm not going anywhere.

87
406.75 --> 408.75
 He said he was going to the toilet.

88
408.75 --> 410.75
 Let's go.

89
410.75 --> 412.75
 He's awake.

90
413.75 --> 415.75
 Are you going out?

91
415.75 --> 417.75
 Yes.

92
419.75 --> 424.60
 He's finally awake.

93
424.60 --> 427.60
 Miki, I'm going to go.

94
427.60 --> 429.60
 See you later.

95
429.60 --> 431.60
 Thank you.

96
431.60 --> 433.60
 I'm going to go, too.

97
433.60 --> 436.60
 I'm going to buy you a souvenir.

98
436.60 --> 438.60
 I'm looking forward to it.

99
438.60 --> 440.60
 Don't follow me.

100
440.60 --> 442.60
 I'm not following you.

101
442.60 --> 453.50
 Let's go.

102
496.14 --> 498.14
 What are you doing?

103
500.14 --> 502.14
 It's nothing.

104
504.14 --> 506.14
 Miki, are you awake?

105
506.14 --> 508.14
 I'm awake.

106
508.14 --> 510.14
 It stopped raining.

107
510.14 --> 512.14
 I don't need it anymore.

108
512.14 --> 514.14
 It's raining.

109
514.14 --> 516.14
 Why?

110
520.09 --> 522.09
 What are you doing?

111
678.98 --> 680.98
 What's wrong?

112
780.98 --> 792.16
 Can't I fly?

113
798.74 --> 801.74
 Can I go to the city?

114
824.40 --> 846.34
 I want to go.

115
847.34 --> 849.34
 Can I come in?

116
849.34 --> 851.34
 Is it cold?

117
851.34 --> 854.48
 It's cold.

118
854.48 --> 887.30
 I'll turn on the air conditioner.

119
889.30 --> 891.30
 It's not cold, is it?

120
891.30 --> 893.30
 It's cold.

121
893.30 --> 895.30
 I turned it on, so it's warm.

122
895.30 --> 899.06
 Let's warm up together.

123
899.06 --> 901.06
 Inside.

124
901.06 --> 902.06
 Inside?

125
902.06 --> 903.06
 It's a nuisance.

126
903.06 --> 905.06
 It's not a nuisance.

127
905.06 --> 907.06
 It's warm.

128
944.74 --> 946.74
 It's cold.

129
948.74 --> 952.56
 Is your hand warm?

130
953.56 --> 955.56
 It's not warm.

131
976.98 --> 978.98
 Your hand is cold.

132
984.62 --> 986.62
 Does it feel good to be cold?

133
986.62 --> 988.62
 No, it's not.

134
1050.20 --> 1052.20
 You're cute.

135
1053.20 --> 1055.20
 I don't want to.

136
1055.20 --> 1056.20
 Why?

137
1056.20 --> 1058.20
 It's difficult.

138
1059.20 --> 1097.87
 It's cold.

139
1199.09 --> 1284.90
 It's cold.

140
1855.78 --> 1857.78
 It's cold.

141
1913.25 --> 1915.25
 Do you lick me?

142
1915.25 --> 1917.25
 Wait a minute.

143
1946.02 --> 1948.02
 Look at the camera.

144
1948.02 --> 1950.02
 I don't want to.

145
1951.02 --> 1953.02
 You don't want to?

146
1954.02 --> 1956.02
 I'll look at the camera.

147
1972.70 --> 1973.70
 What?

148
1973.70 --> 1977.34
 Are you filming?

149
1977.34 --> 1979.34
 Yes, I am.

150
1981.34 --> 1985.61
 It's embarrassing.

151
2012.78 --> 2014.78
 I can see your face.

152
2016.78 --> 2018.78
 Does that mean you want to see my face?

153
2018.78 --> 2019.78
 Yes.

154
2019.78 --> 2021.78
 I couldn't see it.

155
2021.78 --> 2023.78
 I was hiding behind the screen.

156
2051.98 --> 2053.98
 Do you look back later?

157
2053.98 --> 2054.98
 What?

158
2054.98 --> 2056.98
 Do you look back later?

159
2057.98 --> 2059.98
 Do you?

160
2059.98 --> 2061.98
 Sometimes I do.

161
2063.98 --> 2066.98
 I want to see your position.

162
2067.98 --> 2069.98
 What?

163
2069.98 --> 2071.98
 I don't want to.

164
2071.98 --> 2073.98
 Why?

165
2074.98 --> 2076.98
 Do you want to hide it?

166
2078.98 --> 2081.98
 I don't want to show it to anyone else.

167
2081.98 --> 2083.98
 It's only for me.

168
2085.98 --> 2087.98
 I see.

169
2090.98 --> 2095.51
 You've changed.

170
2095.51 --> 2097.51
 Have I?

171
2110.49 --> 2117.00
 Let's do it again.

172
2117.00 --> 2119.00
 Again?

173
2123.68 --> 2127.06
 Do you want to stop?

174
2127.06 --> 2129.06
 Do you want to stop?

175
2131.06 --> 2133.06
 Don't you want to stop?

176
2142.41 --> 2144.41
 You're close to me.

177
2146.41 --> 2148.41
 You've definitely changed.

178
2148.41 --> 2150.41
 No, I haven't.

179
2150.41 --> 2152.41
 I don't want to.

180
2152.41 --> 2154.41
 You haven't changed at all.

181
2154.41 --> 2156.41
 No, I have.

182
2159.41 --> 2167.07
 Take that off.

183
2167.07 --> 2168.07
 This?

184
2168.07 --> 2185.53
 Why?

185
2185.53 --> 2187.53
 I don't want to.

186
2194.26 --> 2219.46
 Can you put it on?

187
2219.46 --> 2224.82
 Yes, I can.

188
2227.82 --> 2229.82
 Put it on from above.

189
2229.82 --> 2231.82
 Can you do it?

190
2231.82 --> 2234.82
 Can you do it?

191
2640.00 --> 2643.89
 It tickles.

192
2689.14 --> 2691.14
 Can I do it?

193
2691.14 --> 2693.14
 What?

194
2693.14 --> 2695.14
 Can I do it?

195
2695.14 --> 2697.14
 Ouch!

196
2697.14 --> 2699.14
 What are you doing?

197
2708.74 --> 2710.74
 Can you cook?

198
2710.74 --> 2713.74
 I can cook quite a bit.

199
2713.74 --> 2715.74
 Really?

200
2717.74 --> 2719.74
 I like self-cooking.

201
2723.74 --> 2725.74
 Are you hungry?

202
2727.74 --> 2729.74
 Yes, I am.

203
2732.74 --> 2734.74
 What should I cook?

204
2735.74 --> 2737.74
 Shall I open the fridge?

205
2737.74 --> 2738.74
 It's OK.

206
2738.74 --> 2740.74
 Is there anything weird in the fridge?

207
2740.74 --> 2742.74
 No.

208
2742.74 --> 2744.74
 Something rotten or something?

209
2745.74 --> 2747.74
 No.

210
2747.74 --> 2749.74
 I have no idea.

211
2749.74 --> 2751.74
 You might be in trouble.

212
2755.72 --> 2757.72
 Something rotten.

213
2757.72 --> 2758.72
 Is something rotten?

214
2758.72 --> 2760.72
 No, it's not.

215
2763.72 --> 2765.72
 There are a lot of vegetables.

216
2767.72 --> 2775.83
 It's cold.

217
2775.83 --> 2777.83
 I'm going to peep.

218
2793.51 --> 2794.51
 It's cold.

219
2794.51 --> 2795.51
 Do you have a towel?

220
2795.51 --> 2797.51
 You didn't wash it.

221
2800.51 --> 2801.51
 Wait a minute.

222
2801.51 --> 2802.51
 Look at the camera.

223
2802.51 --> 2803.51
 I don't want to.

224
2803.51 --> 2804.51
 Wait a minute.

225
2804.51 --> 2805.51
 I really don't want to.

226
2806.51 --> 2808.51
 Why are you looking at the camera?

227
2809.51 --> 2811.51
 I have to concentrate on this.

228
2811.51 --> 2813.51
 I can't look at the camera.

229
2814.51 --> 2815.51
 I'm scared.

230
2815.51 --> 2816.51
 I'm really scared.

231
2818.51 --> 2820.51
 I'm scared, but I like it.

232
2820.51 --> 2821.51
 What do you mean?

233
2821.51 --> 2822.51
 I'm scared, but...

234
2824.51 --> 2825.51
 Wait a minute.

235
2826.51 --> 2827.51
 I think it's a little big.

236
2828.51 --> 2829.51
 It's dangerous.

237
2831.51 --> 2832.51
 What do you think?

238
2833.51 --> 2835.51
 I don't like that.

239
2837.51 --> 2838.51
 It's a little messy.

240
2839.51 --> 2840.51
 What?

241
2840.51 --> 2841.51
 I don't like it.

242
2841.51 --> 2842.51
 What's wrong?

243
2843.51 --> 2844.51
 I'm done.

244
2845.51 --> 2846.51
 I'm done.

245
2848.51 --> 2850.51
 I'm going to put this on.

246
2856.87 --> 2857.87
 Salt and pepper.

247
2868.89 --> 2869.89
 I put too much.

248
2870.89 --> 2871.89
 Are you okay?

249
2872.89 --> 2873.89
 I'm okay.

250
2875.89 --> 2876.89
 I'm okay.

251
2877.89 --> 2878.89
 I'm too scared.

252
2879.89 --> 2880.89
 I'm okay.

253
2882.89 --> 2889.17
 I'm scared.

254
2889.17 --> 2890.17
 I'm going to put it on.

255
2909.23 --> 2910.23
 Do you like it?

256
2910.23 --> 2911.23
 I like it.

257
2913.23 --> 2914.23
 I'm going to put it on.

258
2914.23 --> 2915.23
 I see.

259
2915.23 --> 2916.23
 I like it.

260
2917.23 --> 2918.23
 Do you want more?

261
2918.23 --> 2919.23
 No, wait a minute.

262
2920.23 --> 2921.23
 I don't have enough.

263
2921.23 --> 2922.23
 Why?

264
2922.23 --> 2937.98
 I put too much.

265
2939.98 --> 2942.74
 Do you want to put more?

266
2951.84 --> 2952.84
 I'm going to put it on.

267
2956.75 --> 2957.75
 Did you check it?

268
2958.75 --> 2959.75
 No, I didn't.

269
2960.75 --> 2964.15
 I didn't, did I?

270
2966.15 --> 2967.15
 No, you didn't.

271
2969.59 --> 2970.59
 You didn't?

272
2970.59 --> 2973.42
 Did you?

273
2973.42 --> 2974.42
 No, I didn't.

274
2976.42 --> 2977.42
 You did.

275
2978.42 --> 2979.42
 It's easy to sweat.

276
2985.33 --> 2986.33
 What did you do?

277
2986.33 --> 2987.33
 What did you do?

278
2988.33 --> 2989.33
 You put salt on it.

279
2990.33 --> 2991.33
 You don't have to do that.

280
2991.33 --> 2992.33
 Did you do that?

281
2992.33 --> 2993.33
 No, I didn't.

282
2993.33 --> 2994.33
 What's wrong with you?

283
2994.33 --> 2995.33
 You put too much.

284
2999.79 --> 3000.79
 I didn't.

285
3002.79 --> 3003.79
 You put too much.

286
3004.79 --> 3010.37
 Let's stop here.

287
3010.37 --> 3011.37
 Did you like it?

288
3011.37 --> 3012.37
 Yes, I did.

289
3012.37 --> 3013.37
 Great.

290
3013.37 --> 3014.37
 Do you worry about me?

291
3019.75 --> 3020.75
 Why do you worry about me?

292
3020.75 --> 3021.75
 I'm not worried.

293
3021.75 --> 3022.75
 I knew.

294
3026.90 --> 3027.90
 Are you embarrassed?

295
3028.90 --> 3029.90
 I'm not embarrassed.

296
3031.90 --> 3033.90
 You don't have to feel embarrassed, because you are the one who is being teased.

297
3308.98 --> 3310.98
 I'm really going to quit.

298
3310.98 --> 3312.98
 Why?

299
3312.98 --> 3321.15
 I'm done.

300
3321.15 --> 3391.02
 I've had enough of this.

301
3391.02 --> 3397.41
 Let's have a drink.

302
3407.90 --> 3410.90
 I need to pee.

303
3410.90 --> 3412.90
 I'm starting to get sleepy.

304
3412.90 --> 3414.90
 Why?

305
3414.90 --> 3416.90
 If you really don't want to pee, then it's over.

306
3418.90 --> 3420.90
 I don't want to.

307
3420.90 --> 3422.90
 Don't you mind about me that much?

308
3422.90 --> 3424.90
 I did it

309
3424.90 --> 3426.90
 Where is the rubber?

310
3426.90 --> 3431.42
 There

311
3431.42 --> 3433.42
 How many times did you open it?

312
3433.42 --> 3435.42
 It's not a big deal

313
3435.42 --> 3437.42
 How many times did you do it?

314
3437.42 --> 3439.42
 What?

315
3439.42 --> 3441.42
 Two times

316
3441.42 --> 3449.09
 You did it a lot

317
3449.09 --> 3451.09
 Seriously?

318
3451.09 --> 3459.14
 No

319
3461.14 --> 3463.14
 You must feel good

320
3463.14 --> 3467.28
 Do you feel good?

321
3471.28 --> 3475.87
 Do you want to put it in?

322
3475.87 --> 3477.87
 Do you want to put it in?

323
3477.87 --> 3479.87
 Yes

324
3502.45 --> 3526.24
 It's dangerous

325
3530.24 --> 3567.73
 It's dangerous

326
3567.73 --> 3578.66
 You can do it

327
3582.66 --> 3584.66
 Wait a minute

328
3584.66 --> 3586.66
 It's dangerous

329
3586.66 --> 3588.66
 What do you want to do?

330
3588.66 --> 3590.66
 You can't

331
3590.66 --> 3594.67
 I can't

332
3594.67 --> 3596.67
 Be patient

333
3596.67 --> 3598.67
 I've been patient for a long time

334
3598.67 --> 3600.67
 Be patient

335
3600.67 --> 3602.67
 It's cold

336
3604.67 --> 3606.67
 It's amazing

337
3612.48 --> 3614.48
 Do you feel good?

338
3616.48 --> 3630.35
 It's amazing

339
3636.35 --> 3638.35
 I can't

340
3638.35 --> 3650.18
 I can't

341
3650.18 --> 3652.18
 What do you want to do?

342
3660.85 --> 3662.85
 I can't

343
3662.85 --> 3698.42
 Do you feel good?

344
3698.42 --> 3700.42
 What's wrong?

345
3700.42 --> 3702.42
 I did it

346
3702.42 --> 3711.04
 You did it

347
3711.04 --> 3713.04
 Did you put it in twice?

348
3713.04 --> 3715.04
 Yes

349
3715.04 --> 3717.04
 Do you feel good?

350
3717.04 --> 3719.04
 I don't know

351
3719.04 --> 3721.04
 Do you want to check?

352
3724.74 --> 3728.24
 It's amazing

353
3728.24 --> 3746.08
 It's coming out

354
3746.08 --> 3748.08
 It's coming out

355
3748.08 --> 3750.08
 No

356
3750.08 --> 3752.08
 Wipe it

357
3752.08 --> 3754.08
 It's coming out

358
3754.08 --> 3756.08
 It's coming out

359
3756.08 --> 3758.08
 You can do it

360
3782.51 --> 3784.51
 Do you want to eat?

361
3784.51 --> 3786.51
 Do you want to eat?

362
3786.51 --> 3788.51
 Do you have more?

363
3788.51 --> 3790.51
 If you want

364
3790.51 --> 3792.51
 Thank you

365
3792.51 --> 3794.51
 I'm hungry

366
3794.51 --> 3796.51
 I'm glad

367
3796.51 --> 3798.51
 If you do it again, I'll eat

368
3798.51 --> 3800.51
 Again?

369
3800.51 --> 3802.51
 Yes

370
3804.51 --> 3806.51
 Are you tired?

371
3806.51 --> 3831.65
 No

372
3833.65 --> 3835.65
 I've never been looked at like this

373
3835.65 --> 3837.65
 Do you want to eat?

374
3837.65 --> 3839.65
 No

375
3849.65 --> 3863.26
 I'll put it on

376
3863.26 --> 3878.35
 I can't see

377
3878.35 --> 3880.35
 Do you feel good?

378
3880.35 --> 3892.37
 Yes

379
3894.37 --> 3896.37
 I can't see

380
3902.38 --> 4016.83
 I can't do it.

381
4017.83 --> 4083.31
 Look.

382
4084.31 --> 4086.31
 Can you see it?

383
4088.31 --> 4089.31
 Can you see it?

384
4090.31 --> 4092.31
 How much did you eat?

385
4097.31 --> 4099.31
 It's yours, isn't it?

386
4100.31 --> 4101.31
 You don't like it?

387
4102.31 --> 4104.31
 It's funny, isn't it?

388
4105.31 --> 4107.31
 I don't have any energy left.

389
4107.31 --> 4108.31
 Can I have a half of it?

390
4109.31 --> 4110.31
 Just one?

391
4116.75 --> 4118.75
 You're making a lot.

392
4119.75 --> 4120.75
 I have rice.

393
4121.75 --> 4122.75
 Thank you.

394
4124.75 --> 4125.75
 What is it?

395
4126.75 --> 4127.75
 Do you have tea?

396
4130.75 --> 4131.75
 I want to drink it, too.

397
4132.75 --> 4133.75
 I'll bring it.

398
4134.75 --> 4136.75
 It's in the fridge.

399
4139.75 --> 4141.75
 It's good, isn't it?

400
4169.20 --> 4171.20
 Can I have a coffee?

401
4180.20 --> 4182.58
 It's good.

402
4183.58 --> 4184.58
 Do you have rice?

403
4185.58 --> 4186.58
 I'll bring tea.

404
4187.58 --> 4188.58
 Thank you.

405
4189.58 --> 4190.58
 I'll drink it.

406
4191.58 --> 4192.58
 Thank you.

407
4197.27 --> 4198.27
 Here you are.

408
4199.27 --> 4201.27
 It's still warm.

409
4202.27 --> 4229.22
 Bye.

410
4263.54 --> 4264.54
 Turn off the light.

411
4267.54 --> 4282.86
 Hajime, do you want to turn off the light, too?

412
4283.86 --> 4284.86
 What?

413
4288.86 --> 4289.86
 I'm sorry.

414
4290.86 --> 4304.69
 Thank you.

415
4305.69 --> 4306.69
 Thank you.

416
4310.54 --> 4311.54
 It's beautiful.

417
4322.57 --> 4324.57
 Can I change my clothes?

418
4326.57 --> 4328.57
 I'll bring it.

419
4329.57 --> 4330.57
 I want to change, too.

420
4333.57 --> 4334.57
 It's okay.

421
4335.57 --> 4336.57
 I'll change here.

422
4353.43 --> 4354.43
 Why are you running away?

423
4383.63 --> 4384.63
 Don't you wear it when you sleep?

424
4385.63 --> 4386.63
 Do you wear it?

425
4387.63 --> 4388.63
 I don't wear it.

426
4615.18 --> 4616.18
 What are you going to do?

427
4620.18 --> 4621.18
 What are you going to do?

428
4622.18 --> 4623.18
 Nothing.

429
4624.18 --> 4625.18
 What do you mean?

430
4627.62 --> 4629.62
 Do you want me to lick you, too?

431
4638.02 --> 4673.01
 Do you want me to lick you in the morning?

432
4676.01 --> 4677.01
 You're a pervert.

433
4734.87 --> 4735.87
 I'm sorry.

434
4814.46 --> 4815.46
 Do you want me to change my clothes?

435
4820.46 --> 4821.46
 Do you feel good?

436
4822.46 --> 4823.46
 I feel good.

437
4844.78 --> 4845.78
 What?

438
4871.80 --> 4872.80
 What?

439
4898.97 --> 4899.97
 What did you say?

440
4901.97 --> 4902.97
 What did you say?

441
4913.30 --> 4914.30
 It's all wrinkled.

442
4973.02 --> 4974.02
 Thank you for the meal.

443
4975.02 --> 4976.02
 Don't you eat anymore?

444
4986.90 --> 4987.90
 You're a pervert.

445
5095.95 --> 5096.95
 How many volumes are there?

446
5098.95 --> 5099.95
 How many volumes are there?

447
5099.95 --> 5100.95
 How many volumes?

448
5101.95 --> 5102.95
 Seven volumes.

449
5103.95 --> 5104.95
 Seven volumes?

450
5105.95 --> 5106.95
 What?

451
5106.95 --> 5107.95
 What's wrong?

452
5112.84 --> 5113.84
 Why?

453
5114.84 --> 5115.84
 I've already read the second volume.

454
5116.84 --> 5117.84
 Then, let me read it.

455
5118.84 --> 5119.84
 I'll read the second volume.

456
5120.84 --> 5121.84
 The next one is the third volume, right?

457
5122.84 --> 5123.84
 Yes, the seventh volume.

458
5123.84 --> 5124.84
 What?

459
5125.84 --> 5126.84
 What do you think?

460
5129.84 --> 5130.84
 Urara-chan.

461
5131.84 --> 5132.84
 Don't you have the eighth volume?

462
5133.84 --> 5134.84
 The eighth volume?

463
5136.84 --> 5138.84
 If you don't have it, I don't have it.

464
5139.84 --> 5147.25
 You picked it up on your own.

465
5162.31 --> 5163.31
 What are you doing?

466
5169.72 --> 5170.72
 You're reporting.

467
5171.72 --> 5172.72
 I'm reporting.

468
5181.92 --> 5182.92
 You're licking me.

469
5186.87 --> 5187.87
 No way.

470
5188.87 --> 5189.87
 Why?

471
5190.87 --> 5191.87
 You're busy.

472
5192.87 --> 5193.87
 As you can see.

473
5201.75 --> 5202.75
 Then, I'll just borrow this.

474
5205.13 --> 5206.13
 What?

475
5207.13 --> 5208.13
 Your mouth is not open, right?

476
5210.13 --> 5211.13
 Then, I'll borrow this.

477
5213.13 --> 5214.13
 Hey!

478
5215.13 --> 5216.13
 Open your mouth a little more.

479
5218.13 --> 5219.13
 Your mouth is open, right?

480
5220.13 --> 5221.13
 It's not open.

481
5222.13 --> 5223.13
 Hey!

482
5224.13 --> 5225.13
 Hey!

483
5228.13 --> 5229.13
 What do you think?

484
5279.71 --> 5280.71
 Then, I have a part-time job.

485
5281.71 --> 5282.71
 Goodbye.

486
5283.71 --> 5284.71
 Good luck.

487
5348.78 --> 5354.71
 Hey, what do you think of Hina?

488
5368.80 --> 5369.80
 Just a back touch?

489
5371.80 --> 5372.80
 Do you like her?

490
5372.80 --> 5373.80
 You don't like her?

491
5384.94 --> 5386.94
 Hey, open your mouth again.

492
5387.94 --> 5395.76
 Hina.

493
5397.76 --> 5410.21
 Are you sure you can make me feel better than Miki and Urara?

494
5450.96 --> 5470.17
 Hina.

495
5471.17 --> 5476.86
 I don't like your face that looks good at first.

496
5506.97 --> 5507.97
 Your face is cute.

497
5509.97 --> 5510.97
 Shut up.

498
5572.50 --> 5573.50
 You feel good, don't you?

499
5628.16 --> 5629.16
 It's hot.

500
5648.04 --> 5649.04
 Your face is cute.

501
5651.04 --> 5652.04
 It's not cute.

502
5655.04 --> 5662.15
 I said no.

503
5663.15 --> 5664.15
 Why?

504
5675.31 --> 5676.31
 You feel good, don't you?

505
5677.31 --> 5679.31
 More than Miki and Urara.

506
5734.22 --> 5735.22
 It's hot.

507
5739.22 --> 5746.46
 Do you like this?

508
5747.46 --> 5748.46
 Yes.

509
5883.40 --> 5884.40
 You drank it all.

510
5884.40 --> 5885.40
 It's hot.

511
5895.41 --> 5901.41
 You feel good more than Miki and Urara, don't you?

512
5902.41 --> 5903.41
 Then, choose Hina.

513
5946.67 --> 5947.67
 Karin.

514
5970.40 --> 5978.19
 Do you like Hejime?

515
5980.19 --> 5982.19
 No, I don't.

516
5984.19 --> 5985.19
 You don't?

517
5988.19 --> 6000.39
 I just fell in love with sex.

518
6002.39 --> 6003.39
 Really?

519
6006.39 --> 6008.70
 You're the same as me.

520
6014.70 --> 6015.70
 You like sex, don't you?

521
6037.95 --> 6038.95
 It's like this, isn't it?

522
6040.95 --> 6041.95
 Yes.

523
6041.95 --> 6042.95
 Urara, come here.

524
6043.95 --> 6044.95
 Let's do it together.

525
6065.51 --> 6067.89
 I was looking forward to it.

526
6070.89 --> 6072.89
 What are you doing?

527
6082.20 --> 6083.20
 I'll lend it to you.

528
6083.20 --> 6084.20
 It's not mine.

529
6091.07 --> 6092.07
 Kiss me.

530
6097.69 --> 6113.18
 It's not mine.

531
6118.18 --> 6123.99
 You wanted me to return it, didn't you?

532
6125.99 --> 6126.99
 It's important for three of us.

533
6152.78 --> 6154.78
 Karin, your ears are weak.

534
6160.78 --> 6161.78
 Which one do you like?

535
6163.78 --> 6164.78
 Which one do you like?

536
6166.78 --> 6167.78
 Do you like this?

537
6170.78 --> 6171.78
 I'll lick your ears.

538
6172.78 --> 6173.78
 I want to lick your ears.

539
6181.78 --> 6182.78
 Which one do you like?

540
6195.52 --> 6197.52
 How do you feel being licked?

541
6200.52 --> 6201.52
 It tickles.

542
6203.52 --> 6204.52
 You're good at it.

543
6209.52 --> 6211.52
 It's harder than usual.

544
6212.52 --> 6213.52
 I'm scared.

545
6214.52 --> 6215.52
 I know.

546
6247.57 --> 6248.57
 I'm holding back.

547
6249.57 --> 6250.57
 I'm holding back.

548
6251.57 --> 6252.57
 I'm holding back.

549
6257.57 --> 6258.57
 I'm holding back.

550
6260.57 --> 6261.57
 You're good at it.

551
6262.57 --> 6263.57
 You're good at it.

552
6272.78 --> 6273.78
 You're good at it.

553
6343.49 --> 6344.49
 You like this, don't you?

554
6346.49 --> 6347.49
 Lick it.

555
6350.49 --> 6351.49
 What are you doing?

556
6352.49 --> 6353.49
 Do this.

557
6354.49 --> 6355.49
 Lick it.

558
6357.49 --> 6358.49
 Lick it.

559
6368.18 --> 6369.18
 It tickles.

560
6371.18 --> 6372.18
 Which one do you like?

561
6374.18 --> 6375.18
 It tickles.

562
6376.18 --> 6377.18
 It's hard.

563
6397.87 --> 6398.87
 I want to lick yours.

564
6399.87 --> 6400.87
 I want to lick yours.

565
6401.87 --> 6402.87
 I want to lick yours.

566
6414.06 --> 6415.06
 I'm going to throw up.

567
6418.06 --> 6419.06
 I'm going to lick your ears.

568
6423.37 --> 6424.37
 Lick it.

569
6443.13 --> 6444.13
 It tickles.

570
6510.16 --> 6511.16
 You're drooling.

571
6513.16 --> 6514.16
 What's this?

572
6515.16 --> 6516.16
 What's this?

573
6547.92 --> 6548.92
 Do you want to start?

574
6549.92 --> 6550.92
 I can't hold it anymore.

575
6551.92 --> 6552.92
 No, no, wait a minute.

576
6553.92 --> 6554.92
 What?

577
6554.92 --> 6555.92
 No, no, no.

578
6555.92 --> 6556.92
 That's not good.

579
6557.92 --> 6558.92
 That's not good.

580
6559.92 --> 6560.92
 Then let's put it in Hina's ear.

581
6561.92 --> 6562.92
 What?

582
6562.92 --> 6563.92
 Put it in.

583
6570.50 --> 6571.50
 I can't hold it anymore.

584
6575.47 --> 6576.47
 You're having a fit.

585
6586.16 --> 6587.16
 Do you want to put it in?

586
6589.16 --> 6590.16
 Do you want to put it in?

587
6591.16 --> 6592.16
 I do.

588
6593.16 --> 6594.16
 Please tell me that you want to put it in.

589
6595.16 --> 6596.16
 I do.

590
6597.16 --> 6598.16
 Put it in.

591
6603.71 --> 6650.06
 Oh, it feels so good.

592
6650.06 --> 6661.28
 It goes all the way to my head.

593
6677.94 --> 6678.94
 Does it feel good?

594
6678.94 --> 6680.94
 Yes, it feels good.

595
6689.94 --> 6694.31
 It feels so good.

596
6696.31 --> 6702.35
 I like this.

597
6702.35 --> 6704.35
 Do you like this?

598
6705.35 --> 6707.35
 Look at me.

599
6708.35 --> 6710.35
 I want to look at you.

600
6711.35 --> 6712.35
 This way?

601
6712.35 --> 6713.35
 Yes.

602
6721.58 --> 6723.58
 We look like a couple.

603
6731.39 --> 6783.63
 I can't do it anymore.

604
6783.63 --> 6784.63
 I can't do it anymore.

605
6784.63 --> 6786.63
 I've been licking you all the time.

606
6788.63 --> 6790.63
 Don't you want to put it in?

607
6791.63 --> 6793.63
 Can I put it in?

608
6793.63 --> 6794.63
 Can I put it in?

609
6794.63 --> 6795.63
 Yes.

610
6798.63 --> 6802.99
 Does it feel good?

611
6802.99 --> 6803.99
 Yes.

612
6804.99 --> 6805.99
 Is it?

613
6805.99 --> 6806.99
 What do you mean by, is it?

614
6806.99 --> 6808.99
 What I mean is...

615
6809.99 --> 6810.99
 What do you mean?

616
6810.99 --> 6818.56
 I mean the hair bun feels good, doesn't it?

617
6818.56 --> 6820.56
 How do you mean?

618
6822.56 --> 6823.56
 Please tighten it.

619
6823.56 --> 6824.56
 What?

620
6826.56 --> 6829.56
 Why don't you let me know about that?

621
6829.56 --> 6830.56
 Can you tighten it?

622
6830.56 --> 6831.56
 You can't tighten it?

623
6831.56 --> 6833.56
 Do you want to eat it?

624
6841.32 --> 6843.32
 You want to eat it, don't you?

625
6860.10 --> 6862.10
 Look at this.

626
6862.10 --> 6864.10
 Hina, you don't look at it.

627
6878.55 --> 6880.55
 It's in your mouth.

628
6883.55 --> 6892.62
 Does it feel good?

629
6892.62 --> 6894.62
 It feels good.

630
6911.62 --> 6913.62
 Which one do you feel good?

631
6913.62 --> 6915.62
 Which one do you feel good?

632
6915.62 --> 6917.62
 Both.

633
6917.62 --> 6919.62
 Both?

634
6919.62 --> 6921.62
 I'm sure it's different.

635
6921.62 --> 6923.62
 Which one do you feel good?

636
6925.62 --> 6927.62
 I don't know.

637
6929.62 --> 6931.62
 It's getting weird.

638
6937.62 --> 6939.62
 I don't know.

639
6939.62 --> 6941.62
 I'm just worried.

640
6943.62 --> 6945.62
 Which one do you feel good?

641
6945.62 --> 6947.62
 Which one do you feel good?

642
6951.62 --> 6953.62
 I'm stupid.

643
6975.62 --> 6977.62
 It's amazing.

644
7006.55 --> 7008.55
 It's clean.

645
7008.55 --> 7010.55
 You're the first one to eat it.

646
7018.28 --> 7020.28
 You're the first one to eat it.

647
7020.28 --> 7022.28
 It feels good.

648
7024.28 --> 7026.28
 It's amazing.

649
7038.41 --> 7046.90
 Keep doing it.

650
7046.90 --> 7048.90
 Keep doing it.

651
7048.90 --> 7050.90
 Does it feel good?

652
7050.90 --> 7052.90
 It's amazing.

653
7057.94 --> 7059.94
 It's amazing.

654
7064.41 --> 7101.86
 Put it in your mouth.

655
7101.86 --> 7110.94
 Do you want to eat it?

656
7112.94 --> 7117.98
 It's clean.

657
7129.94 --> 7139.34
 It's amazing.

658
7145.34 --> 7147.34
 It's amazing.

659
7162.90 --> 7166.22
 It's amazing.

660
7275.90 --> 7277.90
 Does it feel good?

661
7277.90 --> 7279.90
 It's amazing.

662
7285.90 --> 7287.90
 It's hard to hold it.

663
7289.90 --> 7291.90
 It's hard to hold it.

664
7301.90 --> 7303.90
 When can I do it?

665
7303.90 --> 7305.90
 When can I do it?

666
7305.90 --> 7307.90
 No, no, no.

667
7321.90 --> 7324.90
 Kyon, Kyon, Kyon.

668
7329.06 --> 7330.06
 Don't do that.

669
7331.06 --> 7332.06
 Don't do that.

670
7333.06 --> 7334.06
 I said, don't do that.

671
7334.06 --> 7335.06
 I'm not good at holding back.

672
7335.06 --> 7337.06
 You're not good at holding back.

673
7339.06 --> 7341.06
 Kyon, Kyon, Kyon.

674
7345.06 --> 7355.24
 I told you not to let anyone out.

675
7370.38 --> 7372.38
 Please let me out.

676
7373.38 --> 7375.38
 What are you talking about?

677
7375.38 --> 7376.38
 Please let me out.

678
7376.38 --> 7377.38
 What?

679
7377.38 --> 7379.38
 Please let me out.

680
7380.38 --> 7382.38
 Are you going to cry?

681
7382.38 --> 7384.38
 No, I'm not.

682
7384.38 --> 7386.38
 I told you not to do that.

683
7403.38 --> 7405.38
 I want to let you out.

684
7405.38 --> 7407.38
 I told you not to do this.

685
7414.38 --> 7416.38
 I'm sorry.

686
7416.38 --> 7418.38
 I'm sorry.

687
7420.38 --> 7425.55
 Are you okay?

688
7427.55 --> 7431.55
 She's trying to get out of the bag.

689
7432.55 --> 7434.55
 But you can't let go of the bag.

690
7434.55 --> 7436.55
 I'm sorry.

691
7443.55 --> 7445.55
 You can't let go of the bag.

692
7448.55 --> 7450.55
 I'm sorry.

693
7456.55 --> 7458.55
 You're getting angry.

694
7458.55 --> 7460.55
 You're trying to get out of the bag.

695
7482.81 --> 7484.81
 You can't let go of the bag.

696
7485.81 --> 7494.82
 Put it in the bag.

697
7503.25 --> 7505.25
 Put it in the bag.

698
7508.25 --> 7510.25
 Give me all of it.

699
7513.01 --> 7515.01
 Give me all of it.

700
7556.26 --> 7558.26
 How do you feel?

701
7558.26 --> 7560.26
 I feel great.

702
7560.26 --> 7562.26
 Which do you feel better?

703
7562.26 --> 7564.26
 I don't know.

704
7564.26 --> 7566.26
 I don't know.

705
7566.26 --> 7568.26
 I don't know.

706
7568.26 --> 7592.78
 I don't know.

707
7592.78 --> 7594.78
 I don't know.

708
7594.78 --> 7601.20
 I don't know.

709
7625.61 --> 7627.61
 I don't know.

710
7638.44 --> 7648.47
 I don't know.

711
7648.47 --> 7650.47
 My waist is so warm.

712
7650.47 --> 7652.47
 My waist is so warm.

713
7652.47 --> 7654.47
 What are you doing?

714
7654.47 --> 7656.47
 Do your best.

715
7656.47 --> 7658.47
 I'm doing it.

716
7664.04 --> 7666.04
 I'm just moving it.

717
7666.04 --> 7668.04
 I'm just moving it.

718
7668.04 --> 7670.04
 I'm not moving it.

719
7672.04 --> 7674.04
 Come on.

720
7674.04 --> 7676.04
 It's moving.

721
7676.04 --> 7678.04
 It's moving.

722
7678.04 --> 7680.04
 Thank you.

723
7684.04 --> 7686.04
 It feels good.

724
7686.04 --> 7688.04
 It feels good.

725
7697.53 --> 7699.53
 I can move it.

726
7699.53 --> 7701.53
 You can move it.

727
7714.38 --> 7716.38
 I want to do it harder.

728
7720.38 --> 7722.38
 Get up.

729
7758.73 --> 7760.73
 It's moving.

730
7762.73 --> 7764.73
 Next, I'll put it in from here.

731
7852.73 --> 7854.73
 Does it feel good?

732
7856.73 --> 7907.53
 Put it on properly.

733
7926.52 --> 7928.52
 You can put it in your stomach.

734
7948.63 --> 7950.63
 Oh, no.

735
7952.63 --> 7967.21
 Do you want to put it in your stomach?

736
7967.21 --> 7972.70
 What should I do?

737
7979.61 --> 7981.61
 I told you to put it in your stomach.

738
8000.57 --> 8002.57
 It's so cute.

739
8006.33 --> 8008.33
 What should I do?

740
8010.33 --> 8016.07
 You put it in your stomach.

741
8016.07 --> 8018.07
 Isn't it heavy?

742
8018.07 --> 8020.07
 It's bitter.

743
8020.07 --> 8022.07
 The taste is bitter.

744
8022.07 --> 8024.07
 What did you eat?

745
8024.07 --> 8026.07
 What did you eat?

746
8026.07 --> 8028.07
 I ate vegetables.

747
8028.07 --> 8030.07
 Can you eat it?

748
8030.07 --> 8033.58
 The taste of vegetables.

749
8037.58 --> 8039.58
 Are you happy?

750
8046.86 --> 8048.86
 Did you have fun?

751
8048.86 --> 8050.86
 I didn't have a gift.

752
8050.86 --> 8052.86
 I didn't have a gift.

753
8056.86 --> 8058.86
 I didn't have a gift.

754
8062.86 --> 8064.86
 Is that so?

755
8064.86 --> 8066.86
 Of course, this is...

756
8068.86 --> 8070.86
 You didn't have a gift, did you?

757
8070.86 --> 8072.86
 Who is it?

758
8078.79 --> 8080.79
 Oh, it's open.

759
8080.79 --> 8082.79
 Come in.

760
8093.90 --> 8094.90
 Who is it?

761
8095.90 --> 8096.90
 It's Ura.

762
8097.90 --> 8098.90
 Good morning.

763
8098.90 --> 8100.90
 I'm here to get a souvenir.

764
8100.90 --> 8102.90
 She found out.

765
8105.90 --> 8106.90
 Thank you.

766
8110.05 --> 8112.05
 Is this a souvenir?

767
8114.05 --> 8116.05
 Try it.

768
8117.05 --> 8118.05
 It's delicious.

769
8120.05 --> 8121.05
 Is it delicious?

770
8121.05 --> 8122.05
 Are you surprised?

771
8123.05 --> 8125.05
 It looks delicious.

772
8125.05 --> 8126.05
 I'm surprised.

773
8127.05 --> 8128.05
 I'm surprised.

774
8133.05 --> 8135.05
 I went on a trip with my family.

775
8137.05 --> 8139.05
 I didn't know that.

776
8140.05 --> 8141.05
 Can I open it?

777
8141.05 --> 8142.05
 Yes.

778
8151.36 --> 8152.36
 I bought this.

779
8153.36 --> 8154.36
 I'm here.

780
8155.36 --> 8157.36
 I'm here to get a souvenir.

781
8158.36 --> 8159.36
 Do you want to drink tea?

782
8159.36 --> 8160.36
 Thank you.

783
8161.36 --> 8162.36
 I was looking forward to it.

784
8163.36 --> 8164.36
 What is the souvenir?

785
8165.36 --> 8166.36
 Which one is it?

786
8167.36 --> 8168.36
 Which one is it?

787
8169.36 --> 8170.36
 Where is it?

788
8171.36 --> 8172.36
 Where is it?

789
8172.36 --> 8173.36
 This is it.

790
8173.36 --> 8174.36
 This?

791
8174.36 --> 8175.36
 This is it.

792
8177.36 --> 8178.36
 It's delicious.

793
8178.36 --> 8179.36
 Why did you eat it?

794
8179.36 --> 8181.36
 I was wondering where the strawberry was.

795
8184.36 --> 8185.36
 Thank you.

796
8187.36 --> 8188.36
 It's delicious.

797
8189.36 --> 8190.36
 It's delicious.

798
8190.36 --> 8191.36
 It's delicious, isn't it?

799
8191.36 --> 8192.36
 No, it's not.

800
8192.36 --> 8194.36
 I think tea is more delicious.

801
8197.36 --> 8198.36
 I want you to know this.

802
8200.36 --> 8203.36
 I'm going on a trip with Hina.

803
8205.36 --> 8206.36
 Congratulations.

804
8206.36 --> 8207.36
 I didn't know that.

805
8207.36 --> 8208.36
 Thank you.

806
8208.36 --> 8209.36
 I didn't know that.

807
8210.36 --> 8212.36
 Let's get along well from now on.

808
8213.36 --> 8214.36
 Of course.

809
8214.36 --> 8215.36
 Thank you.

810
8218.36 --> 8220.36
 She is persistent.

811
8224.36 --> 8226.36
 But she has a good point.

812
8226.36 --> 8227.36
 I think so, too.

813
8230.36 --> 8234.31
 She always supports me.

814
8235.31 --> 8236.31
 Thank you.

815
8237.31 --> 8238.31
 I think so, too.

816
8240.31 --> 8241.31
 I think so, too.

817
8243.31 --> 8245.31
 It looks fun.

818
8246.31 --> 8247.31
 I'm looking forward to it.

819
8247.31 --> 8248.31
 Let me join you.

820
8250.31 --> 8251.31
 Do you want to join us?

821
8252.31 --> 8254.31
 I think I can do this.

822
8254.31 --> 8255.31
 Are you all right?

823
8255.31 --> 8256.31
 Do you want to give it to her?

824
8259.31 --> 8260.31
 Do you want to join us?

825
8261.31 --> 8262.31
 Do you want to join us?

826
8262.31 --> 8263.31
 What do you mean?

827
8266.31 --> 8267.31
 She is funny.

828
8270.31 --> 8271.31
 Thank you.
