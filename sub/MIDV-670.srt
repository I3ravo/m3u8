1
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:16,930
I was in high school, and I had nothing to
do but study, and I was alone in the class.

2
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,630
I used to be a quiet person.

3
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,010
But now, I want to change myself.

4
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,490
So I went to Tokyo University.

5
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,590
I got a girlfriend for the first time.

6
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,530
Unfortunately, my life
is full of ups and downs.

7
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,850
And this summer vacation,

8
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,950
I have no time to go back to my hometown.

9
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,290
So I decided to stay at my
parents' house for three days.

10
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,891
I decided to go back to my parents' house.

11
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:44,570
Ah, my parents' house is so relaxing.

12
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,290
I feel so good.

13
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,350
It's so hot.

14
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,830
What are you talking
about? It's so hot.

15
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,930
You haven't been back to
your hometown for a long time.

16
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,370
You must be so lazy.

17
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,410
You should help your mom a little.

18
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,550
Yes, yes.

19
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,530
You are so noisy.

20
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:09,450
It's been a long time since I came
back to Japan, so let me take my time.

21
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,131
There is nothing to do
in such a shitty country.

22
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,010
Besides, I'm busy
studying every day in Tokyo.

23
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,730
Are you really studying?

24
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,550
Your father is also worried about you.

25
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,630
Here is your favorite somen.

26
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,090
Eat it quickly.

27
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,310
Thank you.

28
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,330
This is what I ate for
the first meal of the week.

29
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,610
Please eat more slowly.

30
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,850
Oh, no.

31
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,350
Do you want me to do that?

32
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,290
Oh, here you are.

33
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,270
You have been so impatient
since a long time ago.

34
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,770
Is it okay?

35
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,990
Grandma!

36
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,190
I brought you a carpet board.

37
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,130
Grandma!

38
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,890
Yes!

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,620
Thank you for everything.

40
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,480
It's hot today.

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,500
You're sweating a lot.

42
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,060
I sweat a lot.

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,280
Did you try the corn from
our field the other day?

44
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,380
It was very delicious.

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
Next time, help me with your field.

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, thank you.

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
Can you help me with the cucumber?

48
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,820
I want to do it.

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,081
If you don't pick it up
quickly, it will crack.

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Is that so?

51
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,240
Oh, I should go home.

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Hey, come out here.

53
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Yes.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,180
Oh, it's been a while.

55
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Yes.

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,640
What?
You didn't say anything when Mio-chan came.

57
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,420
Well, it's been a while.

58
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,780
I told Mio-chan that you would come back.

59
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,766
You were good friends when you were little.

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,080
You played together every day.

61
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,380
I miss you.

62
00:04:59,381 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm glad to hear that.

63
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,400
Of course, I am.

64
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,721
But I was surprised because
it's my first time to see you.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,300
If you have a few days, let's
go to a classmate's house.

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,780
No, I don't want to.

67
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,200
I don't have anyone I want to meet.

68
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,820
You haven't changed at all.

69
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,540
You look the same.

70
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,820
You are the same.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Hey, Mio.

72
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,360
I got a watermelon. Do
you want to eat it? I told a lie.

73
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:34,120


74
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,600
Mio, whom I met after a long time,
became even cuter than before.

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,640
Mio was the Madonna of the school.

76
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,558
She was the manager
of the baseball club,

77
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,920
which everyone admired,
and she was popular.

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,571
The world where I lived was different
from the world where In-chan and I lived.

79
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:58,580
But for some reason, she was
concerned about me and took care of me.

80
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,368
But at that time, I
honestly felt like I wasn't

81
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,400
seen as a man, and
I didn't like it at all.

82
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,070
What?

83
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,250
Huh? Yeah, I'm just eating.

84
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,970
By the way, watermelon is the best.

85
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,370
It's my favorite fruit.

86
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,530
Fruit?

87
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,730
No, watermelon is a vegetable.

88
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,350
No, it's a fruit.

89
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,690
It's a vegetable.

90
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,070
No, it's sweet.

91
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,330
It's not sweet.

92
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,630
No, but it's sweet.

93
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,510
If you say it's sweet, it's sweet.

94
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,511
It's a fruit.

95
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,490
Sweet potatoes are sweet.

96
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,090
Sweet potatoes?

97
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,710
What? Watermelon? Watermelon.

98
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,430


99
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,550
Isn't it a vegetable?

100
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,230
What?

101
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,910
It's a vegetable.

102
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,110
It's not a fruit? Here you are.

103
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,590
Thank you.

104
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,230
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,530
It's hot, isn't it?

106
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,970
The air conditioner is broken now.

107
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,716
I can't say that the air conditioner
is broken in such a hot weather.

108
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,490
It can't be helped.

109
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,630
It's hard for a fisherman
to come to such a village.

110
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,970
Well, I can get used
to the hot weather soon.

111
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,570
I grew up here.

112
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,130
That's right.

113
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,410
I'm going to clean up the laundry.

114
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,670
Hey, I want to go to the
Tokyo Women's Festival.

115
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,710
I don't go there often, so I don't know.

116
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,950
I was looking forward to going
to the Tokyo Women's Festival.

117
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,510
Do you have a
girlfriend? Yes, I do.

118
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,330
Oh, I see.

119
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,150


120
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,710
How old are you? Where did you meet her?

121
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,250
I met her at the same
age at the university.

122
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,750
Oh, is she cute? Well, yes.

123
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,490


124
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,290
Oh, that's nice. She looks like an adult.

125
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,830
Do you have a boyfriend?

126
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,130
I haven't had a boyfriend for a long time.

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,550
What? Was Mio that popular?

128
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,530
Didn't she date a baseball player?

129
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,190
When did you talk about that?

130
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,550
I was surprised that Mio
didn't have a boyfriend.

131
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,190
I want to meet a nice person.

132
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,310
It's delicious.

133
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,790
It's really delicious.

134
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:41,270
【Birds chirping】

135
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,120
The next day, for some reason,
Mio came to my house to play.

136
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,540
I'm sure she has nothing
to do in the countryside.

137
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,541
I don't want to.

138
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm going to the shop next door.

139
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
Can I ask you to help me?

140
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,460
OK. Be careful.

141
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
You, too.

142
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Thank you.

143
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Mio, what do you want
to eat for dinner? Sushi.

144
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,520
I like sushi.

145
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
That's good.

146
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,560
Wait a minute.
Are you going to have dinner?

147
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm going to eat dinner.

148
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,840
Right. You're staying at my house tonight.

149
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Didn't I tell you?

150
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
What?

151
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,780
I'm not staying at your house.

152
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,070
I'm not old enough.

153
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
You used to stay at my house a lot.

154
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Right.

155
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,640
I used to, but not anymore.

156
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
It's OK.

157
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
You're like my daughter.

158
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm just your friend.

159
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm counting on you, Lutz.

160
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm going to go.

161
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:18,740
I'm coming.

162
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,620
Welcome.

163
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Stop it.

164
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,870
Hey, I have something to ask you.

165
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,270
Can I?

166
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,070
What is it?

167
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,950
Did you have a crush on her?

168
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,330
What? It's okay.

169
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,070
I'm your childhood friend.

170
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,990
Answer me.

171
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,930
Oh, well, I did.

172
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,710
I see.

173
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,190
How about compatibility? Is it OK?

174
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,070
What? Compatibility? I don't know.

175
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,690
Well, I guess it's OK.

176
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,210
Hmm.

177
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,610
What's wrong?

178
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,530
I have a problem.

179
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,350
I'm not good at flirting.

180
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,370
I don't know how to get along with others.

181
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,490
I'm not good at flirting.

182
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I see.

183
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,390
I see.

184
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,610
I don't think so.

185
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I don't think so.

186
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,570
So,

187
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,210
you are my sex partner.

188
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
What?

189
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,066
You mean I'm your sex partner?

190
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,090
Yes.

191
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,840
What are you talking about?

192
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,990
Don't make a joke.

193
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,850
No, no, no.

194
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,130
No? Please.

195
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,250
I'm kidding.

196
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160


197
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,730
I'm not kidding.

198
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,610
No, no, no.

199
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:16,611
What are you doing? It's okay.

200
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,410
We are childhood friends.

201
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,710
No, we are not.

202
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:22,270
Are you serious? Yes, I am.

203
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,710


204
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,710
Can't you?

205
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,230
What?

206
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,770
Practice?

207
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,930
Yes.

208
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,370
I can't.

209
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,230
I haven't seen you for a long time.

210
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,231
What?

211
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,570
What?

212
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
What?

213
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
What?

214
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,110
What?

215
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,350
What?

216
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:02,530
What?

217
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:02,590
What?

218
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:03,591
What?

219
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
What?

220
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,910
What?

221
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
What?

222
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,810
What?

223
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,810
I have a girlfriend.

224
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,070
But your friend is worried about you.

225
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,890
Yes, but...

226
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,870
What?

227
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,000
Are your ears and nipples weak?

228
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,980
No, they are not.

229
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,300
It doesn't hurt at all.

230
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
What?

231
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:25,020
I can't do that.

232
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,930
But you don't resist at all.

233
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:39,790
I don't resist.

234
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,190
If you don't resist, it means
you like it, right? No, I'm fine.

235
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,810
I can't move.

236
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,430


237
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,710
You're fine, aren't
you? No, I'm not.

238
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,710
You're noisy.

239
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,030
It's weird.

240
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,750


241
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,730
What? It's weird.

242
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,330
It's not weird.

243
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,930
Say bonzai.

244
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,390
Bonzai.

245
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,070
Say bonzai.

246
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,130


247
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,250
Why?

248
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:41,251
Yes.

249
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:41,890
Bonzai.

250
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,250
I think it's a little disturbing.

251
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,010
Wait a minute.

252
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,730
Let me stretch a little.

253
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,190
No, no.

254
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,390
Look.

255
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,170
This way, like this.

256
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,630
Which one? This one.

257
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,430
Wait, Mio.

258
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,410


259
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,050
What?

260
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,830
I have to think like a child.

261
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,590
Wait, wait, wait.

262
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,290
Wait a minute.

263
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,510
Wait a minute.

264
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,450
This is strange.

265
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,330
Is it strange?

266
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,090
Mio, I'm not a child.

267
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,200
I decide if it's funny or not.

268
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,220
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
I'm sorry.

271
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:38,030
You can make a lot of noise.

272
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,890
Noise?

273
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,310
Yes.

274
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,410
It's embarrassing.

275
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:58,620
Isn't it a bit rude to bite your
nipple like this? It's not rude.

276
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm a man.

277
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,400
Where is she?

278
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,500
She doesn't make a sound.

279
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:11,420
I've never done such a thing.

280
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,530
Then, I'll make you make a sound.

281
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Make a sound? I'm sorry.

282
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm so sorry.

283
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:12,320
I'm so sorry.

284
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
I'm so sorry.

285
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440


286
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,020
Oh! Wait a minute.

287
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,540


288
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
What?

289
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm going to take it off.

290
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Take it off? Here.

291
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880


292
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,120
Can't you take it off?

293
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
No.

294
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
It's not a big deal.

295
00:23:51,630 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm a little embarrassed.

296
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,320
What?

297
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,220
You've already taken it off.

298
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,200
It's not a big deal.

299
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,190
Look.

300
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,420
Don't do that.

301
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,180
If you do that, your
childhood friend will lick you.

302
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm going to sleep.

303
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm going to sleep.

304
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:12,350
You were licked by your childhood friend.

305
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,351
You were licked.

306
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,490
Don't say that. It's embarrassing.

307
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,580
Where do you feel good?

308
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I'll look for it.

309
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,400
Here? What? Nothing.

310
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:06,401


311
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320


312
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,370
Which one is better, you or her?

313
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,810
I can't compare with her.

314
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:39,811
What are you
doing? I'm practicing.

315
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,740


316
00:26:54,865 --> 00:27:00,400
If you can't stand it, I'll do it harder.

317
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:17,260
Wait a minute.

318
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,780
What are you going to do?

319
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,750
I'm going to kiss you.

320
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,530
It feels good.

321
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,610
You shouldn't do that.

322
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,110
It feels good.

323
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:52,111
I'm so sorry.

324
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,390
You are so good at it.

325
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,010
Am I?

326
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,590
Are you better than my girlfriend?

327
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,150
No, I didn't mean that.

328
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,450
I was just saying how I feel.

329
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,070
Then,

330
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,490
I'll make you look embarrassing.

331
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,770
Embarrassing?

332
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,070
Yes.

333
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,050
Stand up.

334
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:23,070
Where are you going?

335
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
What are you doing?

336
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,230
Are you embarrassed?
No, I'm not.

337
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,450


338
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,130
Can I sit down?

339
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:33,670
What?

340
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,230
Can I sit down?

341
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,730
Do you want to sit down?

342
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,870
I want to sit down.

343
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:37,810
Can you see me? Wait a minute.

344
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,130


345
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:50,730
How do you feel being licked by
your childhood friend? I was scared.

346
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,970


347
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:07,620
I would have licked you in many places.

348
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,760
What should I do? Like this.

349
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm sleepy.

350
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,670
Wait, wait.

351
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,270
Don't do that.

352
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:59,270


353
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,370
You have a funny face.

354
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,810
Do you always do
like this? I don't know.

355
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,190
It's hot.

356
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,870


357
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,230
You shouldn't do like this.

358
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,730
Oh, my hand.

359
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,790
I've never done this before.

360
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,170
I'm sorry.

361
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,610
I'm going to slip.

362
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,010
I can't do it.

363
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,460
Look this way.

364
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,650
What are you doing?

365
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,730
What?

366
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,990
Hey,

367
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:07,025
Do you want to lick your
childhood friend's pussy?

368
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,070
Pussy?

369
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,910
Yes.

370
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:14,890
Really?

371
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,430
Yes.

372
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,110
Come here.

373
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Lick it.

374
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Lick it.

375
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,690
Hey, lick me as if you were my girlfriend.

376
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,380
Oh, you're licking me like this.

377
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,220
But I'm not enough at all.

378
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,520
Oh..

379
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,300
I'm sorry.

380
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,530
You shouldn't stop until I go.

381
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,450
Ah!

382
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,330
Ah!

383
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,530
Ah! It feels so good!

384
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,180
What are you going to do after this?

385
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,840
What are you going to do?

386
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:37,980
Koga-chan is not here.

387
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:40,666
Are you going to put it in as it is?

388
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,040
What?

389
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,360
Do you want to put it
in your childhood toy?

390
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
What? Wait a minute.

391
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,560


392
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,120
This is not good.

393
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,080
I think my dad's toy is better.

394
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
What?

395
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,280
Is it here?

396
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,140
Yes.

397
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Oh, here it is.

398
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,320
Your dad is good.

399
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,480
My father used to hide
all these things over there.

400
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Oh, did he? Yes, he did.

401
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360


402
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,330
Is this OK?

403
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Yes.

404
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,620
Can you put it on?

405
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,120
Well, I'm not sure.

406
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Can I put it on? I did it.

407
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,180


408
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,220
You're good at it.

409
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,010
Why? I feel sick.

410
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,560
You are sick.

411
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060


412
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,110
You look so sick.

413
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,810
Really?

414
00:39:35,295 --> 00:40:04,981
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Oh!

415
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,180
Oh!

416
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Oh!

417
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,930
Oh!

418
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,270
Oh!

419
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,350
Oh!

420
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,330
Oh!

421
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,530
We have sex at last.

422
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,830
Ah!

423
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,250
Ah!

424
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,291
Something will pierce you.

425
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,010
Right?

426
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,350
Oh!

427
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,770
Oh!

428
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,430
Oh!

429
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,050
Oh!

430
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,370
Oh! I want to move.

431
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:44,250
I want to move.

432
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,490


433
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,010
Oh! I'm excited.

434
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,330
I'm nervous.

435
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,370


436
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,090
Oh! I'm nervous.

437
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,600
It's hard.

438
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,420
It feels good.

439
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,980
It's too hard.

440
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:18,900
It feels good.

441
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:52,400
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

442
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:53,681
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

443
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,550
No.

444
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,520
You were about to go.

445
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,840
Did she talk to you
about the daycare center?

446
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
What?

447
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,000
How was it? It was normal.

448
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,760
It was normal.

449
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,940
It's cold.

450
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:22,941


451
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,460
What should I do? It's cold.

452
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:51,180


453
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,800
We have a good chemistry, don't we?

454
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,220
I don't know if we have a good chemistry.

455
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,680
I don't know if we have a good chemistry.

456
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,500
I think we have a good chemistry.

457
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:47,240
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

458
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,460
That may be a good thing.

459
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
What?

460
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,870
Wow, I'm getting used to it.

461
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,690
I feel so good.

462
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,570
I feel so good.

463
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:28,771
How long do I have
to do this? It's enough.

464
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,090


465
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,470
It's good, isn't
it? I feel so good.

466
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,850
I feel sick.

467
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,140
I'm sick.

468
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,270
I'm sick.

469
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,650


470
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,000
Let's take a break.

471
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,040
A break? I'm sick, too.

472
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,140


473
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,400
I've never done this before.

474
00:47:28,401 --> 00:47:29,401
Don't do it.

475
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,460
Don't you do it with
your girlfriend? I'm sorry.

476
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,380
Don't do it.

477
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Don't do it.

478
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,720


479
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,930
I'll let you go if you say yes.

480
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,870
You've been a patient type for a
long time, haven't you? Hang in there.

481
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,890
No, you can't.

482
00:48:50,235 --> 00:49:26,460


483
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,940
No, you can't do that.

484
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,560
Put your head down.

485
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:58,760
Let me go.

486
00:49:58,761 --> 00:49:59,761
Let me do it.

487
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,850
Oh, no.

488
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,170
I'm tired.

489
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,210
I'm tired.

490
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:58,050
I'm tired.

491
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,370
It's still my turn.

492
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:56,580
I feel better when you look at my face.

493
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:57,581
It's dangerous.

494
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,380
It's dangerous if you look at my face.

495
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,620
You look like that.

496
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,060
It's dangerous.

497
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
It's dangerous.

498
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,780
I can't do it anymore.

499
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:28,781
Hang in there.

500
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,460
I can't do it anymore.

501
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:30,461
I'm going to sleep.

502
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,060
I'm going to sleep.

503
00:52:33,135 --> 00:52:35,580
I'm going to sleep.

504
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,920
Did you leave?

505
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,600
Did you leave? I'm sorry.

506
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,560
I told you no.

507
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,780
Why are you so fast?

508
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,730
Hey, Ryo!

509
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,570
What are you doing? My butt.

510
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:34,350


511
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,070
I drank the spirit of Sananajimi.

512
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,220
How did you drink it?

513
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,450
You can't drink it, can you?

514
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:16,010
It's already over.

515
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,370
Can you drink it again?

516
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:30,970
You are taking a video, aren't you?

517
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:37,170
You can do whatever you like.

518
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,390
Whatever I like?

519
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,010
You can do many things that
you can't do to your girlfriend.

520
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,430
Really?

521
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:22,210
It's amazing that you can do it right
away even though I told you to do it.

522
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,570
Isn't it iron? It's very hard.

523
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,150


524
00:56:14,070 --> 00:57:18,520
You can use my pussy more.

525
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:38,060
You can do what you can't always do.

526
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,120
You should have told me earlier.

527
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,740
We are a good match,
aren't we? I'm sorry.

528
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,741
I'm sorry.

529
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,640
I'm sorry.

530
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,100
I'm sorry.

531
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,300


532
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,440
Let's go crazy together.

533
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,800
Together?

534
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,340
Yes.

535
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,680
Let's go crazy.

536
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,581
Pretty... It's pretty
good... Pretty good...

537
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:32,760
Ah, hot.

538
01:01:34,260 --> 01:02:29,310
Take me out.

539
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,350
Take me out.

540
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,550
Where should I take you out?

541
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,230
Take me out to the bello.

542
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,190
No, to the bello.

543
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:53,750
Ah, hot.

544
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:55,130
Take me out.

545
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,070
I'm sorry.

546
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:01,930
I'm sorry.

547
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,830
I'm sorry.

548
01:03:05,265 --> 01:03:09,470
I'm sorry.

549
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,470
It's hot.

550
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,560
My neck hurts.

551
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:07,530
It's so good.

552
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,450
I feel so good.

553
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,390
I feel so good.

554
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,310
Great.

555
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:20,610
I feel so good.

556
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,770
It's your second time,
but you feel so good.

557
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,681
I'm sure you two get along well.

558
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:41,420
I like you.

559
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,520
What?

560
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:57,189
It seems that our body
compatibility was the best, and

561
01:04:57,201 --> 01:05:01,360
that day I had sex many times
until my mother came back.

562
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,850
Oh, it looks delicious.

563
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,010
Well, let's eat it right away.

564
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,750
Yes, let's eat.

565
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:32,751
Let's eat!

566
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,730
Which one do you
want to eat? Salmon roe.

567
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:39,550


568
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,170
You really like salmon
roe, don't you? Yes, I love it.

569
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:43,171


570
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,290
Oh, there is seaweed.

571
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,150
It's good.

572
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,950
It's good.

573
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,620
How is it? It's good.

574
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:55,710


575
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,090
Anago is the best, isn't it?

576
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,650
Anago?

577
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,850
Anago is the best.

578
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:19,110
By the way, can you eat anago?

579
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,530
Anago? I can eat it.

580
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,510
I'm used to eat it.

581
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,870
You are an adult.

582
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:27,390
Of course.

583
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,550
I can eat anago.

584
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,470
Here you are.

585
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,950
Thank you.

586
01:09:34,075 --> 01:09:36,330
Tuna is good, too.

587
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,350
Tuna is the best.

588
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,010
You don't have to look at it.

589
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:41,650
Tuna is the best.

590
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:42,690
What?

591
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,550
Tuna is the best?

592
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:45,670
Yes.

593
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,550
I'm going to talk while eating.

594
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,610
I'm going to eat while talking.

595
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:57,330
It was delicious.

596
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,450
I'm so full.

597
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,030
I'm so full.

598
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,261
It's been a while since we had sushi.

599
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,210
Thank you for the tea.

600
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:09,590
It was so good.

601
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:10,970
It was, wasn't
it? Let's clean up.

602
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:12,710


603
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,550
What did we do during the day?

604
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,250
Did you go out? Well.

605
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,670
..

606
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:27,371
Well, but... What did we do?

607
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,710
We did a lot of things.

608
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,930
A lot of things?

609
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:31,950
A lot of things.

610
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,350
We talked about the old days.

611
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:36,510
We played games, too.

612
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,530
Yes, we did.

613
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:39,670
Games? Yes, we did.

614
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,511
It was nostalgic.

615
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,470
It was a long time ago.

616
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,810
Yes, it was.

617
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,190
You two get along well.

618
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,410
Shall we sit down? No, thanks.

619
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:51,350


620
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,470
You are our guest.

621
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:53,370
Really? Thank you.

622
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,650
Hayato.

623
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,310


624
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:21,670
I came here because I
wanted to do something erotic.

625
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,370
What are you talking about?

626
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,970
Your mother is here.

627
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,810
Were you excited during the day?

628
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:34,811
What do you mean?

629
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:40,090
I didn't have time, but I can't.

630
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:41,730
You can't? I can't.

631
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:44,070
It's okay.

632
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,650
I can't.

633
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:47,950
I'll be scolded.

634
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:53,230
I have an aunt. Let's kiss.

635
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,050
It's okay.

636
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,870
Wait a minute.

637
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,350
It's okay.

638
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:24,530
Are you okay? I'm okay.

639
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,530


640
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,440
He says he's okay.

641
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,980
You like this,
don't you? It's dark.

642
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:21,790


643
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:23,990
Are you sure you don't want
to be found out? Don't worry.

644
01:13:24,535 --> 01:13:26,510
You like me, don't you?

645
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:32,010
I like you, but... Don't worry.

646
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:52,050
If you touch here, your
voice will come out.

647
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,430
Of course.

648
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:12,550
Hey, Mio.

649
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,780
What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

650
01:14:15,781 --> 01:14:17,260
What do you want to eat?

651
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,680
Breakfast?

652
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,020
Bread or rice? I want bread.

653
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,260


654
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,740
Bread?

655
01:14:28,675 --> 01:14:30,436
Do you have any side dishes
you want to eat? I don't know.

656
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,560


657
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,020
Egg? Egg? I got it.

658
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,900


659
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,660


660
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,480
I'll think about it.

661
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,660
Thank you.

662
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,460
But you were a little excited,
weren't you? No, I wasn't.

663
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:59,100
I was excited, but...

664
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:14,230
You know all the weaknesses.

665
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:43,590
I don't know.

666
01:15:54,530 --> 01:16:07,510
Don't make a sound.

667
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:13,950
Hey, you guys.

668
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:15,950
Yes?

669
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,570
Is your face all right?

670
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,430
My face?

671
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:20,950
Yes.

672
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,330
I'm not stabbed.

673
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:23,331
It's not broken.

674
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,770
If you need it, put it on.

675
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,430
OK.

676
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:29,790
The air conditioner is
broken and it's still open.

677
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:31,750
Oh, I see.

678
01:16:52,380 --> 01:17:09,610
You like the left one, don't you?

679
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:44,110
Are you all right?

680
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:50,820
You have a puffy face.

681
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,290
Do you have a puffy
face even though I'm here?

682
01:17:58,291 --> 01:17:59,291
Are you OK?

683
01:18:00,605 --> 01:18:02,470
I'm going to touch you.

684
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:10,970
Are you OK?

685
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:26,980
You don't look at me at all.

686
01:18:39,105 --> 01:18:40,540
Look at me.

687
01:18:41,710 --> 01:19:21,960
You look painful.

688
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:56,510
Don't do that.

689
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,270
Don't do that.

690
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,470
Hang in there.

691
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,170
Hang in there.

692
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:09,171
Hey, Rio.

693
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:11,070
What?

694
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:12,650
Did you bring the
toothbrush? I did.

695
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,610


696
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:15,710
Did you?

697
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:16,270
Yes.

698
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,490
I was going to give it to
you if you didn't have it.

699
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,490
Really? Thank you.

700
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:19,730


701
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,080
You are a good girl.

702
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Thank you.

703
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:16,990
You did your best.

704
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:23,390
I didn't play.

705
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,410
You didn't.

706
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,480
But you did your best.

707
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:43,060
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

708
01:22:43,061 --> 01:22:44,220
You're making me feel sick.

709
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,840
I'm going to make you feel sick.

710
01:22:57,905 --> 01:23:06,740
I'm going to make some noise.

711
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,840
Noise?

712
01:23:52,655 --> 01:24:03,520
Oh, my God!

713
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,420
Oh, my God! I feel light.

714
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,580
Oh, it's gone.

715
01:24:08,581 --> 01:24:09,581
Hey, Mio.

716
01:24:58,730 --> 01:24:59,730


717
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,500
Yes?

718
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,540
Aren't you thirsty?

719
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,980
Well, I think I'm fine now.

720
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,841
I see.
Let me know if you want to drink something.

721
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,350
Okay.

722
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,340
I'll make you some coffee later.

723
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:13,860
Oh, thanks.

724
01:25:13,861 --> 01:25:15,340
Thank you.

725
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,580
It's no good.

726
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,560
It's close.

727
01:25:24,515 --> 01:25:29,360
It's no good.
What are you going to do if it's found out?

728
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,400
Was it hard for you to be stopped
when you wanted to play Seiji?

729
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,900
It's a little hard.

730
01:26:02,785 --> 01:26:10,740
I want to bully him a lot.

731
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:27,670
He is unconscious.

732
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:32,960
Let's go.

733
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,470
He is coming.

734
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:49,550
What?

735
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:14,550
It's time to take it out, isn't it?

736
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,270
It's a little dangerous.

737
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,030
What?

738
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:20,770
It's a little dangerous.

739
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:21,410
Dangerous?

740
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:22,070
Yes.

741
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,930
Do you want to
take it out? I do.

742
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:25,850
Are you okay?

743
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:35,770
You can take it off.

744
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:23,460
Oh, you're out of your mind
in front of your grandmother.

745
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
She drank it.

746
01:29:46,425 --> 01:29:55,230
Hey, you guys!

747
01:29:59,010 --> 01:29:59,710
What is it?

748
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,570
We can sleep in the same room, right?

749
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,770
Is it OK? Yes, it's OK.

750
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:07,590


751
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:09,190
I'll prepare a bed for you.

752
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:10,650
OK.

753
01:30:11,915 --> 01:30:20,060
Are you OK?

754
01:30:21,065 --> 01:30:22,065
Thank you for the meal.

755
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,030
And we decided to sleep in the same room.

756
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,820
Wake up.

757
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,460
Wake up.

758
01:31:37,655 --> 01:31:38,655
Wake up.

759
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:44,880
Wake up.

760
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,440
Wake up.

761
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,220
It's too hot to sleep.

762
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,040
Wake up.

763
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,520
You're awake.

764
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:14,100
It's so hot that I can't sleep at all.

765
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:22,520
Hey, let's have sex secretly
so that my mom doesn't find out.

766
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:27,430
It's good.

767
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:31,150
Let's do it.

768
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,810
I'm going to be addicted to being with you.

769
01:32:36,811 --> 01:32:37,811
That's right.

770
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,770
Because you've been the best match so far.

771
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:50,980
It's good, isn't it?

772
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,780
Look, you don't hate it.

773
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,070
Give me your tongue.

774
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,720
I like kissing you.

775
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,180
You really like ears, don't you?

776
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:24,060
I'll fill your brain with me.

777
01:35:56,585 --> 01:35:57,585
Your voice came out.

778
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,670
You really like me, don't you?

779
01:36:34,100 --> 01:37:03,660
If you make such a voice,
Grandma will find out.

780
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:48,590
I like your happy face.

781
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,360
I love the way you feel my nipples.

782
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,900
You want me to lick your
nipples quickly, don't you?

783
01:39:00,515 --> 01:39:04,300
You want me to lick your
nipples like this, don't you?

784
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:13,970
This nipple is amazing.

785
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:18,130
I can't stop licking your nipples.

786
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:49,630
Look at my face carefully.

787
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:50,631
Look at me.

788
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:11,230
Look at me a lot when I talk to you.

789
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:14,700
I like to move my lips like this, too.

790
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:41,310
I'll be a little loud, so
don't make a sound.

791
01:42:41,311 --> 01:42:42,311
Don't go out yet.

792
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:21,140
Don't go out yet.

793
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:22,700
Don't go out yet.

794
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,000
Because you want to have
sex with me, don't you?

795
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,300
So don't go out yet.

796
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,890
So don't go out yet.

797
01:44:30,891 --> 01:44:31,891
Oh, my goodness.

798
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:41,240
Well, lick my hand.

799
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:03,830
It's not good for you to come here.

800
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,690
Lick my hand.

801
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:11,940
How do you like my smooth hand?

802
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,960
Do you have a girlfriend?

803
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,440
What do you think?

804
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,560
You lick me very well.

805
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,660
It feels good.

806
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,740
I want to get along with you.

807
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:51,460
I want to sleep more.

808
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,700
You are so wet.

809
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:01,720
You are so sticky.

810
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:24,350
Hey, do you want to have sex?

811
01:50:26,605 --> 01:50:27,630
I'll put you in my arms.

812
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:53,070
I put you in my arms.

813
01:50:53,071 --> 01:50:54,190
Oh, my God.

814
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:05,590
Oh, my God.

815
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:08,550
I think I'll be fine if I just put it in.

816
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,020
I'm getting used to it little by little.

817
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:27,580
How do you feel?

818
01:52:32,760 --> 01:54:22,080
You can't do this to
your girlfriend, can you?

819
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:49,860
I'm so happy to be able to work with you.

820
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:27,790
You want to see a movie, don't you?

821
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:09,800
I've never been this
down on my knees before.

822
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:38,310
Let me go.

823
01:57:38,311 --> 01:57:39,311
Let me go.

824
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:06,520
Let me go from behind.

825
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:44,820
I used up all my manko.

826
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:36,260
I can't hold my voice any more.

827
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:51,430
I love this self.

828
02:00:53,130 --> 02:00:55,150
I love it.

829
02:00:55,570 --> 02:01:12,200
I want to look at my face properly.

830
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:56,230
I want you to taste my pussy.

831
02:03:27,005 --> 02:03:36,000
You look like you can't stand it anymore.

832
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:54,800
I want you to let out a lot of your blood.

833
02:04:02,970 --> 02:04:04,090
You can do it.

834
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:06,390
It's okay.

835
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,690
Let it out to your mouth.

836
02:04:59,955 --> 02:05:01,070
Wow, it's freezing.

837
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:03,241
How many times have I done this today?

838
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:26,180
I think I can sleep well tonight.

839
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:30,200
But I might wake up again.

840
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,770
It's time to take a bath.

841
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:58,140
It's the best time to take a bath.

842
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:00,320
I feel so good.

843
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,480
I want to take a bath.

844
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:05,460
Let's take a bath.

845
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,160
Here we go.

846
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,220
Wait, wait, wait.

847
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,000
It's dangerous to take a bath at once.

848
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:13,540
Oh, no.

849
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:15,440
You've already taken a bath.

850
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:17,180
I took a bath by myself.

851
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,700
What did you buy?

852
02:06:18,701 --> 02:06:21,340
Did you find it? I think so.

853
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:24,000


854
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:25,600
You found it again.

855
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:28,760
What are you doing? I found it.

856
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:30,280


857
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:33,380
I'm embarrassed.

858
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,820
What are you going to do?

859
02:06:36,410 --> 02:06:37,650
I'm embarrassed to take a bath.

860
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:39,990
Are you?

861
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:41,500
I'm embarrassed.

862
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:44,460
I can't take a bath without permission.

863
02:06:46,690 --> 02:06:47,690
Ouch!

864
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:53,700
If you find out that I'm washing
my body, you'll be in trouble.

865
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
It's OK.

866
02:06:59,215 --> 02:07:01,720
Do you want me to wash your body?

867
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:04,160
Your body? Yes, your body.

868
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,600
It's OK.

869
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:08,220
I can wash my body by myself.

870
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:09,720
What? It's OK.

871
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:10,880


872
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,580
I can wash my body by myself.

873
02:07:15,581 --> 02:07:18,940
Well, I'm going to tell my mom.

874
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:22,780
What?

875
02:07:23,155 --> 02:07:25,436
I'm going to tell her that we
are taking a bath together.

876
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:29,960
That's not fair.

877
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:31,760
You can't do that.

878
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:34,440
That's not fair.

879
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:36,640
You can't do that.

880
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Can I wash my face?

881
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,680
Please wash your face.

882
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:41,360
Can I?

883
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:42,400
Please wash your face.

884
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:43,740
I did it.

885
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,300
I'm Toshi.

886
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:54,680
Sit here.

887
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:57,340
Here?

888
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:58,680
Yes.

889
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:03,000
You are good at saying.

890
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,900
I'm not good at it.

891
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,120
Thank you.

892
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:25,180
I'm embarrassed.

893
02:08:25,575 --> 02:08:27,860
You're just laughing.

894
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:31,440
I'm embarrassed to be seen.

895
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:41,990
But I can do this.

896
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:48,070
What's this?

897
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:54,430
I want to do this every
day when I get married.

898
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:55,751
You want to be petted, don't you?

899
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:30,670
You are rubbing your boobs.

900
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:34,350
It may feel good.

901
02:09:34,351 --> 02:09:35,351
What should I do? Speak up.

902
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:45,850
I can't.

903
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:48,630
What? My mom is here.

904
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:49,910
It's OK.

905
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:53,010
No, it's not.

906
02:09:53,790 --> 02:09:55,110
I'll be drunk.

907
02:09:56,130 --> 02:09:57,130


908
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:58,470
Really?

909
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:36,050
I feel good, too.

910
02:10:36,051 --> 02:10:37,051
What?

911
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:54,970
I'll massage your butt.

912
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:57,850
My butt? Yes, your butt.

913
02:10:58,150 --> 02:10:59,150


914
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:16,890
It's not sexy, isn't it?

915
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,210
What are you talking about?

916
02:12:03,980 --> 02:12:07,600
I feel good when I do this.

917
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:09,420
You feel good?

918
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:12,240
What? Hey, touch me.

919
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:22,960


920
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:24,380
Touch you? That's right.

921
02:12:28,165 --> 02:12:30,760


922
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:34,080
I always get used to being with you.

923
02:12:36,165 --> 02:12:37,160
So, play with me more.

924
02:12:37,161 --> 02:12:37,840
I'm so sleepy.

925
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:39,580
What did you
say? I feel so good.

926
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:17,630
I'm so sleepy.

927
02:13:52,570 --> 02:13:55,790


928
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:58,450
I'm sleepy, too.

929
02:13:59,230 --> 02:14:00,070
I'm sleepy.

930
02:14:00,071 --> 02:14:01,071
Are you tired? No, I'm not.

931
02:14:01,790 --> 02:14:02,790
Thank you.

932
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:13,700
Thank you.

933
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:25,120
Thank you.

934
02:14:25,121 --> 02:14:26,121


935
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:27,760
You look so tired.

936
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,420
No, I'm not.

937
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,260
No, I'm not.

938
02:14:32,410 --> 02:14:33,480
I don't know what to do.

939
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I'll clean up here.

940
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:09,590
What? Why are you running away?
You like my Fela, don't you?

941
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:12,230
I'm not running away. I feel good.

942
02:15:12,231 --> 02:15:13,231
I'm so hungry.

943
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:44,480
I'm not done yet.

944
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:50,620
I'm not done yet.

945
02:15:51,590 --> 02:15:56,620
I'm not done yet.

946
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:02,620
You can't do that.

947
02:16:44,605 --> 02:16:46,040
You're about to puke.

948
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,440
You're so full.

949
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:52,640
I'm about to puke.

950
02:16:54,580 --> 02:17:03,840
What's that? It's hot.

951
02:17:03,841 --> 02:17:04,841


952
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:14,520
You can spit it out.

953
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:19,580
Spit it out in your mouth.

954
02:17:56,930 --> 02:17:58,230
Ouch!

955
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:10,350
【A】

956
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:12,590
【A】 【A】

957
02:18:12,965 --> 02:18:17,031
【A】 【A】 【A】

958
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:25,490
【A】 【A】

959
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:27,990
【A】

960
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:33,730
【A】

961
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:44,510
I'll keep it a secret so
that you won't find out.

962
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:16,180
It's quite beautiful.

963
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:19,920
It's been a long time
since I saw fireworks.

964
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:21,540
It's so beautiful.

965
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:24,100
Do you want to run?

966
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:27,780
It's getting smaller.

967
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:29,020
A little more.

968
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:30,120
You're fast.

969
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:32,440
A little more.

970
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,480
A little more?

971
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:45,800
The movement of the house is the best.

972
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:46,700
Is it? It's beautiful.

973
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:49,080


974
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:54,720
Are you going home tomorrow?

975
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,480
Yes.

976
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:01,460
If your girlfriend finds
out, you'll be in trouble.

977
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:04,460
I guess so.

978
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,780
Do you like her? I guess so.

979
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:10,980


980
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,060
I'm more sexy and cute.

981
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,700
What are you talking about?

982
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:18,701
I don't think so.

983
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:22,920
But I think we have a good compatibility.

984
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:29,320
Well, long-distance relationship
is lonely, so it's impossible.

985
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:31,620
What? Are you
serious? That's right.

986
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:34,480


987
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:41,740
I've loved you for a long time.

988
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:48,440
Well, even if I'm not there, there
are a lot of guys who like you.

989
02:20:49,870 --> 02:20:56,660
That's not true. I like you.
It's easy to be with you.

990
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:01,560
That's because you haven't
seen me as a man yet.

991
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:08,700
No, that's not true. I've been
seeing you as a man for a long time.

992
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:24,490
Let's make a promise
not to forget at the end.

993
02:21:26,490 --> 02:21:30,170
Let me remember everything in my body.

994
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:09,220
It may be the last time to be with me.

995
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:14,870
Thank you for being with me at the end.

996
02:25:30,380 --> 02:25:34,500
You don't have to do it carefully.
Do it seriously.

997
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:20,440
I love being licked.

998
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:21,780
I love everything about you.

999
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:25,220
Lick me more.

1000
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:33,560
I love everything about you.

1001
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:44,300
Do you still love me?

1002
02:28:46,420 --> 02:28:48,940
I don't love you.

1003
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:46,560
I want to lick you.

1004
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:47,660
I want you to lick me.

1005
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:49,380
I want you to lick me a lot.

1006
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:24,360
It feels good.

1007
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:45,810
I'm sorry.

1008
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:49,550
I'm sorry.

1009
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:16,910
I love you so much.

1010
02:31:18,905 --> 02:31:21,090
I love you so much.

1011
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,080
I'm sorry.

1012
02:31:32,180 --> 02:32:00,660
I don't want to go.

1013
02:32:03,460 --> 02:32:04,460
Why?

1014
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,560
I don't want to go.

1015
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:08,880
My legs...

1016
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:10,940
My legs...

1017
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:39,900
I'm sorry.

1018
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:42,300
I'm so sorry.

1019
02:32:46,265 --> 02:32:48,260
I'm sorry.

1020
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:51,340
I'm sorry.

1021
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:53,320
I'm sorry.

1022
02:33:10,035 --> 02:33:11,460
I want to cry.

1023
02:33:12,740 --> 02:33:18,160
I want to cry, too.

1024
02:34:00,160 --> 02:34:01,160
Oh, no.

1025
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:02,840
It feels so good.

1026
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:12,800
I'll hug you.

1027
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:51,590
I'm sorry.

1028
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,000
I beg you.

1029
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:28,880
It's hot, isn't it?

1030
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:29,720
It's hot, isn't it?

1031
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:32,260
It's hot, isn't it?

1032
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:43,050
What's wrong?

1033
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:53,160
Do you like my body? I love you.

1034
02:35:53,161 --> 02:35:54,161
Here you are.

1035
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:06,680
I'm sorry.

1036
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,580
Go, go, go.

1037
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:42,140


1038
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:56,960
Ventriloquism More.

1039
02:36:56,961 --> 02:36:58,500
More.

1040
02:37:08,940 --> 02:37:15,140
I can't get it off.

1041
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:37,220
I can't get it off.

1042
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:19,580
Do it one more time.

1043
02:39:22,870 --> 02:40:04,870
It feels good, doesn't
it? I want more.

1044
02:40:37,805 --> 02:40:54,040
I want you to hit me more.

1045
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:54,880
More.

1046
02:40:54,881 --> 02:40:56,000
Hit me more.

1047
02:40:56,001 --> 02:40:57,001
Give me a kiss.

1048
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:22,790
More.

1049
02:41:23,890 --> 02:41:24,890
More.

1050
02:42:23,370 --> 02:42:24,070
I'm going to sleep.

1051
02:42:24,330 --> 02:42:25,330
I'm going to sleep.

1052
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:29,700
It's painful, isn't it?

1053
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:54,540
I'm going to do what you like the most.

1054
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:57,780
What I like the most?

1055
02:44:58,140 --> 02:44:59,340
What you like the most.

1056
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:01,680
What I like the most.

1057
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:03,960
Is that so? I'm scared.

1058
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:06,600


1059
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:09,140
You like this,
right? I feel so bad.

1060
02:45:28,690 --> 02:45:30,530


1061
02:45:33,060 --> 02:45:34,760
I'm going to cry.

1062
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:40,720
This may be the last time I cry.

1063
02:47:45,340 --> 02:47:52,520
まけおいまけ、.

1064
02:47:54,420 --> 02:47:55,420
No!

1065
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:27,650
Do you know how much I love you?

1066
02:48:31,510 --> 02:48:42,060
I don't want it to end yet.

1067
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:43,540
Say, I love you.

1068
02:49:46,420 --> 02:49:47,500
I love you.

1069
02:49:49,780 --> 02:49:57,950
I love you.

1070
02:49:59,530 --> 02:50:00,530
I love you.

1071
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:01,730
I love you.

1072
02:51:05,515 --> 02:51:08,420
I will never take my life out.

1073
02:51:09,210 --> 02:51:10,220
Please do it forever.

1074
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:45,880
I love you.

1075
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:47,580
I love you so much.

1076
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:55,230
I love you.

1077
02:51:55,530 --> 02:51:56,770
I love you so much.

1078
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:00,100
I love you.

1079
02:52:00,250 --> 02:52:01,220
I love you.

1080
02:52:01,221 --> 02:52:18,020
I love you.

1081
02:52:18,021 --> 02:52:20,940
I love you.

1082
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:27,420
※This is a sound effect.

1083
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:30,660
※This is a sound effect.

1084
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:34,020
I'm sorry.

1085
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:38,140
I'm always sorry.

1086
02:53:42,380 --> 02:53:43,770
I'm sorry.

1087
02:54:16,550 --> 02:54:20,250
Is this the taste of the
last life? Oh! Come here.

1088
02:54:24,130 --> 02:54:25,130


1089
02:54:44,070 --> 02:54:52,260


1090
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:53,780
Over there?

1091
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:55,240
Yes.

1092
02:54:58,660 --> 02:55:01,280
Are you OK? I'm sorry.

1093
02:55:03,550 --> 02:55:04,580
I miss you.

1094
02:55:19,435 --> 02:55:28,140
I want to be with you. I
want to be with you forever.

1095
02:55:30,700 --> 02:55:37,210
I want to be with you, too.

1096
02:55:39,070 --> 02:55:40,490
Will you stay with
me? Yes, I will.

1097
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:46,540
Really?

1098
02:55:47,190 --> 02:55:48,190
Yes.

1099
02:55:49,170 --> 02:55:50,170
Yes.

1100
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:53,290
You are blushing.

1101
02:55:53,610 --> 02:55:54,610
You are cute.

1102
02:56:05,880 --> 02:56:15,670
This is the best memory.

1103
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:19,870
Me, too.

1104
02:56:23,220 --> 02:56:26,315
This is a record of a few
days when I was drunk on

1105
02:56:26,327 --> 02:56:29,310
sex in the countryside
with my childhood friend.
