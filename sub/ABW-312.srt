1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
Is it recording?

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,080
Wow, it's so bright.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,860
Hello, I'm Mai Nanashima.

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,740
I'm going to the place where
my boyfriend is waiting for me.

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Let's go!

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
Let's go.

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,720
Wow, the weather is so nice.

8
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:45,940
To be honest, I've been a
sunny girl lately, haven't I?

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,720
The wind...

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,840
The weather is so nice.

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,440
The wind was stronger than I thought.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,660
Look at my high heels.

13
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
I'm wearing high heels.

14
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,600
They're about 10cm high.

15
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,450
Well, this is my 20th work.

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,770
It's already my 20th.

17
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,070
Time flies.

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,930
I'm still nervous.

19
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,030
I'm nervous.

20
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,930
I'm sweating a lot today.

21
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,490
It's really hot right now.

22
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,890
Look at this nail. Isn't it cute?

23
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,170
I've been into simple nails lately.

24
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,630
This is a nail called Baby Boomer.

25
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,970
That's the name of the nail.

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:10,350
It's hot.

27
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,890
I don't know what I'm going to do today.

28
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:28,830
I heard that there is a place to
stay, but I'm excited about what to do.

29
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,290
I'm excited.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,310
I'm heading to the station.

31
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:43,030
I'm going to get on the train
and head to the meeting place.

32
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,720
I have my hair curled today.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,740
Does it look good on me?

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,520
My hair grew, didn't it?

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
It grew a lot.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,580
Which do you like, my
short hair or long hair?

37
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,581
Which one do you like?

38
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,340
I can see the station!

39
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,240
I can see the station!

40
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,180
I'm at the station!

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
I'm at the station!

42
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,930
I'm going to take the train now!

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,940
You mean you want to get rid of it?

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes, I want to get rid of it.

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,340
Recently?

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,620
Last year, I got rid of it
when I went out of my house.

47
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,520
That's terrible.

48
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,960
How did you get rid of it?

49
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't know.

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
What's wrong?

51
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,440
I don't know.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,680
I really want to get rid of it.

53
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Thank you.

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,240
Mai-chan, what did you hear today?

55
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,660
What do you think?

56
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,661
What do you think?

57
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,800
Do you want to stay here?

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Yes.

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
That's fine.

60
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,790
That's fine.

61
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm looking forward to it.

62
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,580
The atmosphere has changed, hasn't it?

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,520
Has it changed?

64
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,640
It has changed a lot.

65
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:34,860
You look different.

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,020
I look different?

67
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:36,820
Yes, you do.

68
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,861
You look more like a girl.

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Really?

70
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,820
You look more like a girl.

71
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:41,821
I see.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:42,880
I see.

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,940
You look like you're going to take it off.

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,820
Oh, my.

75
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,100
Let me see.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,500
Oh, my.

77
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,501
You look great.

78
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,550
I feel like I'm being watched.

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,190
What's the right way to wear it?

80
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,770
Isn't it nice to take it off?

81
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,050
It's one of them, isn't it?

82
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,510
Yes, it's one of them.

83
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,450
Oh, my!

84
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:09,850
It's a little...

85
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,770
It's amazing.

86
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,510
I'd like to fix it.

87
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,986
It's a little dangerous to do it here.

88
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,970
It's a little dangerous.

89
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:19,771
It's a little dangerous
if I stretch my hand.

90
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,430
I think it's about time to come into view.

91
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,010
Is this it?

92
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,560
Yes, yes, yes.

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,240
It's so long.

94
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,800
I've never seen it before.

95
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,300
Can you see inside?

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,620
Yes, I can see inside.

97
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,580
By the way, how about you?

98
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,520
I haven't seen inside.

99
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,521
You haven't seen inside?

100
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
No, I haven't.

101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,900
You can't see inside from outside.

102
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,320
Yes, I can't see inside.

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Because it's private.

104
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,900
Then, let's go inside.

105
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:14,020
Can you see it?

106
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,780
Yes, I can see it from here.

107
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:23,180
Yes, yes, yes.

108
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,181
It's amazing.

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,700
Thank you.

110
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,060
Wow, it's amazing.

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
It's amazing.

112
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:32,840
How is it?

113
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,540
It's amazing.

114
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
It's beautiful.

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,080
It's like a welcome drink.

116
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,000
There is also a welcome champagne.

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
It's amazing.

118
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
It's a strange feeling.

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Is it strange?

120
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,970
It's good, isn't it?

121
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,010
Oh!

122
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,510
It's amazing!

123
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,150
It's a success!

124
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,590
It's cute!

125
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,750
Isn't it cute?

126
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,410
It's so cute!

127
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,150
It's so cute!

128
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,710
It's so cute!

129
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:12,711
It's so pretty.

130
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,590
I feel like I'm an influencer.

131
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,270
I agree.

132
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,550
It's even more gorgeous.

133
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,630
How about you, Mai-chan?

134
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,810
Do you drink alcohol?

135
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,190
I don't drink strong alcohol.

136
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,570
Strong?

137
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,190
What?

138
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:30,890
Really?

139
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,290
It's really cold.

140
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,890
Of course I prepared it.

141
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,610
That's great.

142
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,710
I usually drink a lot.

143
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:39,711
I don't think so.

144
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,330
You're different from your character.

145
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,210
He's an old man inside.

146
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,211
He's so cute.

147
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,490
I think he was definitely
a man in his previous life.

148
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,670
He's quite... And
he's not sloppy.

149
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,290
He's not sloppy.

150
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,350
Why is he not sloppy?

151
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,390
He doesn't drink expensive bar.

152
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,470
He's a man who really wants to drink.

153
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
To what?

154
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,760
To what?

155
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
To what?

156
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Eh?

157
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,340
First limousine?

158
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
First limousine!

159
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,340
Nice sound.

160
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,700
Thank you.

161
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Cheers.

162
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,961
Cheers Cheers Cheers.

163
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,730
I can do it.

164
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,190
You can do it!

165
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,690
You can do it!

166
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:11,730
You can do it!

167
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,931
You won't have to do it again.

168
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,270
Huh?

169
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,490
You're doing it!

170
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,130
You're doing it, Mai!

171
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
Wow, she's fast!

172
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,040
This girl is fast!

173
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,200
She's fast!

174
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,060
This girl is fast!

175
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,720
I was getting thirsty...
She's gone already.

176
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,080
I'm getting thirsty... No, no!

177
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:35,580
Not at all.

178
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:38,800
Well, it's like water
compared to soju, isn't it?

179
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,640
When you smile more, it
means you're drunk, right?

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
That's right.

181
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
And you sweat a lot.

182
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,140
How do you sweat?

183
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:46,620
Ah!

184
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
I want to take this off more than before.

185
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,380
But I was hiding it.

186
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,240
It's a possibility that
all the jeans are soaked.

187
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,960
But I'm going to take it off properly.

188
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
What do you call it when it's really bad?

189
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:02,800
When I was riding, I got sunburned.

190
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
I see.

191
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,560
Which part of your body is
the easiest to get sunburned?

192
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,360
My arms and legs.

193
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,860
Your legs?

194
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes, my legs.

195
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,480
Really?

196
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
My heels.

197
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,060
My legs are in danger.

198
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Now?

199
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,620
Yes, they are.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I like it.

201
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,200
What do you mean?

202
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,220
The nails look good.

203
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,040
The outer part.

204
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,480
The nails look good.

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,800
Can you show me?

206
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
The nails.

207
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm so sweaty.

208
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I can't do it.

209
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,680
The nails are beautiful.

210
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,480
The nails are beautiful.

211
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,720
I can't do it.

212
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,740
I can't do it.

213
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,720
I can't do it.

214
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,620
Are you blushing?

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,580
No, I'm not.

216
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:53,581
It's not blurry at all.

217
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,220
I'm so embarrassed.

218
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,416
You'll slip if you walk barefoot.

219
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,900
My legs are so strong.
You'll slip if you walk barefoot.

220
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:58,440
It's so tight.

221
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,600
I don't want to. It's so tight.

222
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,601
It's so shiny.

223
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
You're so shiny, Mai-chan.

224
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,280
I don't want to. I'm so embarrassed.

225
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,321
This is... It's so slippery.

226
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,880
I can't wear my seat belt,
so I slip in front of you.

227
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,640
I see.

228
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm so embarrassed.

229
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,580
That's how it is.

230
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,580
I don't want to.

231
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,200
This is definitely for mania.

232
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,460
It's for mania.

233
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,380
This is for mania.

234
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
There's a lot of garbage on it.

235
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,260
It's fine. It's beautiful.

236
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,480
I don't want to.

237
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
But it's blurry.

238
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,980
I thought it was just sweat.

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,880
It's different.

240
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,700
It's hot. I'm sweating.

241
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,116
Sweat is up to my forehead.

242
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,440
Not here?

243
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,140
I'm sweating on my armpits, too.

244
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,440
It's narrow.

245
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I don't want to.

246
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,400
If you dress like this, you
can show your armpits, right?

247
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,980
You have to show your armpits with this.

248
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,340
How many people came to the cafe today?

249
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,420
I came by train.

250
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
How do you wear a fishing rod?

251
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,720
Like this.

252
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,720
People like this never grab a fishing rod.

253
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Is that so?

254
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,120
It's not a fishing
rod, it's a vertical one.

255
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I like the stick.

256
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,040
I feel like I'm curious about your eyes.

257
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,041
Like this.

258
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:15,940
Show me.

259
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,960
Show me.

260
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm sweating.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
I don't know.

262
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,760
How is it?

263
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,460
I don't know.

264
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
I'm sweating a lot.

265
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
Wow.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,140
I just touched it.

267
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,140
Let's eat.

268
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,700
I don't like it.

269
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,740
I've tasted it.

270
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
It's the most delicious.

271
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,400
Do you think you've become
a little erotic doing this job?

272
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,780
A little bit.

273
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,600
These nails.

274
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660
These nails.

275
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,080
These nails.

276
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:06,220
I don't know what you're
going to do with that nail.

277
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,300
What are you going to do with it?

278
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,360
For example, like this.

279
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,100
Thank you very much.

280
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
Here?

281
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Over there.

282
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Thank you very much.

283
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
It's getting harder.

284
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,930
It's dangerous.

285
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,150
It's dangerous.
I'm about to swear an oath of loyalty.

286
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,870
It's dangerous.

287
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,950
This is it.

288
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,850
Can I have a double service?

289
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,270
Oh, it's a cafe.

290
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,750
Great.

291
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,090
It's wonderful.

292
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,050
It's amazing.

293
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,430
This is a little... We
can do it anytime, right?

294
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,330
Can we do it anytime?

295
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,510
Yes, yes, yes.

296
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:04,990
That's right.

297
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,850
You can take it off anytime.

298
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,690
Look.

299
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,870
You can take off your
panties from the side.

300
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,490
Oh, really?

301
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,770
You can take it off from the side.

302
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,410
Mai-chan.

303
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,170
Mai-chan.

304
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
It's getting bigger.

305
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,890
It's coming out.

306
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,050
It's coming out, Mai-chan.

307
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:28,670
I washed it with my nails.

308
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,480
It's so hot.

309
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,020
I'm going to apply hand sweat.

310
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,540
It's great.

311
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,400
It's so luxurious.

312
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,420
You're so kind.

313
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,596
I'm going to touch your nipples.

314
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Wait a minute.

315
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,520
You're so kind.

316
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,580
It's going to come out.

317
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,160
It's going to come out.

318
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,020
It's fun.

319
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:53,330
How was it?

320
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,910
It was a success.

321
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,390
It's dangerous.

322
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,380
Let's go over there.

323
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,980
Let's have a champagne kiss.

324
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,070
It's hot, isn't it?

325
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,630
It's getting hot. I'm sweating.

326
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,970
Is it good?

327
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,530
Yes, it's good.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,120
It's good.

329
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,050
Oh, there are two.

330
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,610
Two.

331
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,910
Two at once.

332
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,210
Two at once.

333
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,900
Ai-chan, you're doing amazing things.

334
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,680
In the limousine.

335
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:39,400
What do you think of this kind of date?

336
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm embarrassed to be seen.

337
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
From around?

338
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,720
Can't you see the light?

339
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,580
I think I can see the light.

340
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,160
But I can't see the light.

341
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,410
I can see it.

342
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,550
You said you could see it, but
you didn't let go of your penis.

343
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:01,951
I haven't seen you for a long time.

344
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,110
I've been watching you all the time.

345
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,870
Chikumi, did you stand up?

346
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,920
You're sweating a lot.

347
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,600
I think you should take this off.

348
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,860
The density of the car suddenly increased.

349
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,660
Did you care about the car next to you?

350
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,140
It was a high-rise car.

351
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm looking at it.

352
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,820
You're looking at me, aren't you?

353
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,460
I'm embarrassed.

354
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
I don't mind if you look down from here.

355
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,520
I can't see the back of the car.

356
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,260
The driver is just looking ahead.

357
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,980
He's not looking at you.

358
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,260
I don't think it's about you.

359
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,840
Try this on.

360
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,620
It's like a naked apron.

361
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,640
That's right.

362
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,120
Yes, yes, yes.

363
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Like that.

364
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Wow!

365
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,260
It's coming out!

366
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,720
One side.

367
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
One side.

368
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,160
Show me.

369
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,100
I can't see the ground at all.

370
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,580
I can see a little.

371
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,960
I can't see anything.

372
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Wow.

373
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,600
This is amazing.

374
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
This horizontal ground.

375
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,480
The horizontal ground is amazing.

376
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:06,840
Can you look at the camera for a moment?

377
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,130
So cute.

378
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,830
Can you see this?

379
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,470
Yes, I can.

380
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,790
I can't understand what he is saying.

381
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,570
This is very good.

382
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,930
Do you like it?

383
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,630
Yes.

384
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,090
This is very good.

385
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,490
This is very good.

386
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,710
This is very good.

387
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:48,711
It's hot.

388
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,790
Champagne tastes good.

389
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,190
Are you thirsty?

390
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:21,490
Yes.

391
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,390
But you still have some
alcohol in your mouth.

392
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,870
Alcohol is good.

393
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,090
Alcohol is good, but what about your mouth?

394
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,580
Is it wet?

395
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
No.

396
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
It's not wet.

397
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,460
This is the one you like.

398
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:15,060
There are two of them.

399
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,540
The black one.

400
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,660
It's embarrassing.

401
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Look at the driver's eyes.

402
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,760
Look at this side.

403
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,500
No, it's embarrassing.

404
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
What are you doing?

405
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm getting used to it.

406
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,720
Are you getting used to it?

407
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
How do you usually use it?

408
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,240
Do you want me to hold your hand?

409
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,820
It hurts.

410
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,900
It hurts.

411
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:42,790
I'm going to cry.

412
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,680
I'm going to cry.

413
00:26:28,170 --> 00:27:01,800
You were in pain, but you got better.

414
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:02,801
I'm going to cry.

415
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,200
I don't want to die.

416
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,870
How is it?

417
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,490
It's better than before.

418
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,750
What?

419
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,010
I feel like an adult.

420
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,290
It's a little moody, isn't it?

421
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,370
It's good, isn't it?

422
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,010
I'm so nervous.

423
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,070
Can I do it?

424
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,250
Of course.

425
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm so nervous.

426
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,830
Are you getting used to it?

427
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,250
Not yet.

428
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,950
I'm nervous.

429
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
Can't I touch it?

430
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,200
You have to hold the weird part.

431
00:29:35,230 --> 00:30:47,990
I'm a little worried about this.

432
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,740
I'm curious about this place.

433
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,560
Can you show me your butt?

434
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,760
Your panties are cute.

435
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,380
Is it for today?

436
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,780
Yes, it's for today.

437
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,740
You're eating.

438
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,360
You're eating, Ai-chan.

439
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,580
It's so beautiful.

440
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
It's so beautiful.

441
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Oh, I saw it.

442
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I saw your butt.

443
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,600
Did you see it?

444
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,980
Yes, I did.

445
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:46,981
Oh, really.

446
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,020
Let me see from the other side.

447
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,340
Let me zoom in more.

448
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:56,341
Let me smell it.

449
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Wow.

450
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,840
I can smell it.

451
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,480
Mayu-chan, can I lick your butthole?

452
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:38,840
What?

453
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
It's embarrassing.

454
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,790
It smells good.

455
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,290
It's embarrassing.

456
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,730
It doesn't smell.

457
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
What are you doing?

458
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
Hey, look at the camera.

459
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,300
You have a big mouth.

460
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:37,660
I'm glad you're okay.

461
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,150
You're crying.

462
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,230
You're crying.

463
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,070
You're messy.

464
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,910
Your eyebrows are messy.

465
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,650
Let's go downstairs.

466
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,400
I'm sorry.

467
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,880
It feels good, doesn't it?

468
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,060
Yes, it does.

469
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,580
I can't do it.

470
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,160
I can't do it.

471
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:28,380
I'm sorry.

472
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:58,900
I'm sorry.

473
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:28,500
I didn't know I was breathing.

474
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,060
I'm still breathing.

475
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:37,620
It's so hard to breathe.

476
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,610
I'm holding my breath.

477
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,950
I can't breathe.

478
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,750
It's hot.

479
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,130
It's hot.

480
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:06,610
It's hot.

481
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,611
It feels good.

482
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,550
It's hot.

483
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,910
It's hot.

484
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,150
Do you want to lick it?

485
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,240
It feels good.

486
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:07,816
Do you feel better after the bath?

488
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
Yes.

489
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,660
Look at this.

490
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:47,600
Do you feel better?

491
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
What's wrong?

492
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
It hurts.

493
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:41,010
I feel sick.

494
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:42,011
You have to drink this.

495
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,590
I feel sick.

496
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:53,610
You have to drink this.

497
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,810
You have to drink this.

498
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,810
It's hot.

499
00:42:40,940 --> 00:43:02,660
Show me your hand.

500
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,250
It's so beautiful.

501
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:20,610
I'll show you this before that.

502
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:29,020
Can I put this in the water?

503
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,260
Help me.

504
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,000
I'll hold your hand.

505
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,300
It's cold.

506
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,900
How do you feel?

507
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,840
I feel good.

508
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,300
How do you feel?

509
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,740
I feel good.

510
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,240
I feel good.

511
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:17,381
I want to go outside I want to go
out While no one can touch you.

512
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,380
I'm scared!

513
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,030
She's scratching her back.

514
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,470
Mai-chan, you're great
at scratching your back.

515
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,370
Does it feel good to have a live chin-poo?

516
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,570
Yes, it feels good.

517
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,550
Do you like a live chin-poo?

518
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,710
Say you like a live chin-poo.

519
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,520
I like a live chin-poo.

520
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm going to cry again.

521
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,660
I'm going to cry.

522
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:51,960
I want to cry too.

523
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,280
Do you want to cry?

524
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,281
Yeah.

525
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:18,890
Oh, no.

526
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,760
It's amazing how you use your legs.

527
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
You're moving.

528
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,380
I'm moving.

529
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,920
Oh, no, Moe-chan.

530
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,500
It's not good to tighten
your legs like this.

531
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,160
My legs are so tight.

532
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,460
I don't feel good.

533
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,120
Do you feel excited?

534
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,000
Do you feel excited in such a place?

535
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,060
I can't do it.

536
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,620
How do you feel?

537
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,200
You like toys, don't you?

538
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Yes, I do.

539
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,790
Let's go.

540
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,870
I don't want to die.

541
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:29,700
No...

542
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,180
I can't do it.

543
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,640
No, no, no.

544
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:45,961
You don't want to get in trouble?

545
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,760
I can't get in trouble.

546
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,620
I can't do this.

547
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,360
I can't do it.

548
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:03,400
Help me.

549
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,960
You can do it.

550
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:17,960
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

551
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,640
I'm going to cry.

552
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
You're so happy.

553
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,560
You're so happy that you're going crazy.

554
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:44,550
Hang in there.

555
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:46,550
Let me see your back.

556
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,110
Your back is amazing.

557
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,830
Your back is amazing.

558
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,400
Does your back feel good?

559
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,720
Yes, it feels good.

560
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Slippery.

561
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,680
Moe-chan's lens is broken.

562
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,210
Moe-chan, can you do it by yourself?

563
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,660
Moe-chan, let me see your face.

564
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,720
There, there.

565
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:41,620
I'm going to put it out from the bag.

566
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,220
Can I have a bunch?

567
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
I'm not bringing it.

568
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,140
Can I have a bunch?

569
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,380
I want it in there.

570
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,700
Do you want a bunch?

571
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,200
I want a bunch!

572
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,260
Oh, my God.

573
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,260
Oh, my God.

574
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,880
Oh, my God.

575
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,380
Oh, my God.

576
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:16,800
Oh, my God.

577
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,280
Oh, my God.

578
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,940
Oh, my God.

579
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:20,860
Oh, my God.

580
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,861
Are you okay?

581
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,526
Do you want me to put my
hands on you from below?

582
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,550
Are you okay?

583
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,790
Put your feet up here.

584
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,090
Put your hands together.

585
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:44,110
Look at this.

586
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,590
It's so dark.

587
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,300
Do you like this?

588
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,860
Oh, it feels good.

589
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,200
Oh, great.

590
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,780
Here, here.

591
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Mae-chan.

592
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,400
There are various stickers.

593
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,560
I'm sorry.

594
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,460
It's okay.

595
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,350
I'm sorry.

596
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,430
I want to go to the bathroom.

597
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:50,626
Do you feel good to lie in a dog's belly?

598
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,800
I feel great.

599
01:01:54,310 --> 01:02:20,260
I want to take the dog out of the room.

600
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:27,100
I want to go home.

601
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,660
Take the dog out of the room.

602
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,720
Let me go.

603
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:35,380
You can do it!

604
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,280
You can do it!

605
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,280
You can do it!

606
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,560
Mayu-chan, touch it.

607
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,780
There's a lot down there.

608
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:25,430
There's a lot down there.

609
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:29,930
Ma-chan, would you
like to clean up a little?

610
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,320
I was nervous.

611
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,960
Would you like to sit inside?

612
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,780
Yes.

613
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,700
Ma-chan, you're sweating a lot.

614
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,180
Come over here.

615
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,920
You're soaking wet.

616
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,340
I'm sweating all over.

617
01:04:12,341 --> 01:04:12,580
It's full of sweat.

618
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,260
Look at the sofa. It's wet.

619
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,400
It's terrible.

620
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:19,760
What's this?

621
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,260
It looks like a person's hair.

622
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,420
What's this?

623
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,540
It's full of sweat.

624
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,820
It's beautiful.

625
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:33,821
You are a good boy.

626
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,940
No, I don't want to.

627
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:39,220
Look at this.

628
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,540
Mai-chan's sweat.

629
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,590
Yummy.

630
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,020
It's hot.

631
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,080
I'm soaked.

632
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,220
Are we going on a date?

633
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,940
I'm a little hungry.

634
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,640
I'm looking for a restaurant.

635
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,540
I don't think there is a restaurant.

636
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,370
Let's go for a walk.

637
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,470
Let's go.

638
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,650
It's so cute.

639
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,010
It's amazing.

640
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,270
It's so big.

641
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,590
It's as big as your eyes.

642
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,910
You like it.

643
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,630
It's amazing.

644
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:04,930
You like it, don't you?

645
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,930
It's amazing.

646
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:07,450
It's so big.

647
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:08,451
It's as big as your eyes.

648
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,650
It's a pineapple.

649
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,750
Isn't it amazing?

650
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,430
This is what Hawaii is all about.

651
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,150
It's amazing.

652
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:18,570
It's Hawaii.

653
01:06:18,571 --> 01:06:19,571
How is it?

654
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,360
Is it beef?

655
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,720
I think so.

656
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,580
It's good.

657
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,400
It's warm and good.

658
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:56,220
What kind of meat do you eat?

659
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,260
My favorite part is...

660
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,720
Hormone.

661
01:07:02,721 --> 01:07:03,800
I like pork cutlet.

662
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,880
I like pork cutlet.

663
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,480
I like pork cutlet.

664
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,340
I like pork cutlet.

665
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
I like pork cutlet.

666
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:13,320
I like pork cutlet.

667
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,321
I like Motsunabe.

668
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,860
I see.

669
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,340
Here you are.

670
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,460
Thank you.

671
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,781
I only eat this before I die.

672
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:30,430
You are amazing.

673
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:31,650
I'm nervous.

674
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,050
I'm nervous.

675
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:34,610
Are you nervous?

676
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,690
I'm shaking.

677
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:38,310
It looks so good.

678
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,470
It looks so good.

679
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,430
It looks so good.

680
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:51,390
It looks so good.

681
01:07:52,790 --> 01:08:03,550
I got a spoon.

682
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,690
I got a spoon and ice cream.

683
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,690
I can't eat whipped cream.

684
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:20,630
Where do you eat this?

685
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:24,370
I eat it from ice cream because it melts.

686
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,150
I eat it with pancakes.

687
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,590
You have a good face.

688
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,470
I cut this.

689
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:41,790
He's eating.

690
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:42,570
He's eating.

691
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,750
Oh, wait.

692
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,870
Slow down.

693
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,930
He's eating.

694
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:50,350
Wait, wait.

695
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,430
Oh, no.

696
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,170
He's in his mouth.

697
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,510
I wanted him to eat more slowly.

698
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:59,650
I wanted him to eat
more slowly like we did.

699
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,410
He's eating.

700
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,890
Where is it?

701
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:11,810
Let's check it with this.

702
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:20,740
It's on your eyebrows.

703
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,300
You said that the person
you like is your type, right?

704
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,900
Yes.

705
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,320
But it's not about appearance.

706
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,140
It's about compatibility.

707
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,340
That's important.

708
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,000
It's important.

709
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:45,580
I'd like to do it before the month.

710
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,400
Do you want to do it before the month?

711
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,020
Yes So you want to do
it once and have a taste.

712
01:09:52,980 --> 01:10:00,780
Yes I think so No, I don't I'd like
to do it before the month I see.

713
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,140
What do you want to make sure?

714
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,860
The compatibility What
kind of compatibility?

715
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,916
What is the most important
thing in a relationship?

716
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,300
I don't really know.

717
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,080
Please tell me.

718
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,360
Well... What is the most
important thing in a relationship?

719
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,520
Well...

720
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,520
I don't know.

721
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,680
Size?

722
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:33,650
Body?

723
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,040
I don't know.

724
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,600
Body?

725
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:37,300
I don't know.

726
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:37,740
I don't know.

727
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,020
Hold this.

728
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,520
I can't hold it anymore.

729
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,660
I think this is enough.

730
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,240
How about this?

731
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:50,860
It's easy to understand.

732
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,980
What if this is real?

733
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:53,840
Yes.

734
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:54,860
What do you think?

735
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,260
It's too small.

736
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:56,660
What?

737
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:57,740
Isn't it too small?

738
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,820
Mai-chan said this is not enough.

739
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,400
Isn't that enough?

740
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,460
So, it's a little short.

741
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,620
Well, it's... It's
about this long.

742
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,840
How about the thickness?

743
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:13,600
It's medium.

744
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,060
How is it?

745
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,440
This is not good.

746
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,600
This?

747
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,440
This is not good.

748
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,780
This is not good.

749
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,280
This is not good.

750
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:22,660
This is not good.

751
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:23,320
This is not good.

752
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,600
This is not good.

753
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:26,000
Well...

754
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,250
What is important?

755
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:32,810
The length or the thickness?

756
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,291
The hardness and... Yes.

757
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,920
The thickness and... What?

758
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,500
Hardness and length.

759
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,000
Hardness and length are important.

760
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,040
Hardness is important.

761
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,680
How long is the length?

762
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:51,780
I'll measure the length.

763
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,500
Isn't it just this long?

764
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,160
Isn't this long?

765
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,900
No, I don't have this much.

766
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,340
I don't have this much.

767
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:03,540
I don't have this much.

768
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,920
I think it's quite long.

769
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,000
I think it's about 20cm.

770
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:08,720
No way.

771
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:10,880
I didn't get it.

772
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:11,860
You mean I didn't get it?

773
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,140
No.

774
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,400
You mean I didn't get it?

775
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
Let's do it again.

776
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,270
It's good.

777
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,490
It says kiss.

778
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:33,970
Kiss?

779
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:38,670
How about this?

780
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,070
It's good.

781
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:43,450
Great.

782
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,510
Let's take a picture.

783
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:45,511
Let's take a look.

784
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:47,690
Oh, it's good.

785
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:49,830
Oh, it's good.

786
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,250
Oh, K?

787
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:51,750
K?

788
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,070
Kiss's K.

789
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,010
Like this?

790
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,210
Kiss's K.

791
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:55,530
Oh, good, good.

792
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:56,930
It's not K.

793
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:58,090
It's not X.

794
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,270
It's not K.

795
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,790
Kiss's... Look.

796
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,390
Oh, it's true.

797
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:02,950
Oh, where did it go?

798
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:03,790
Where did it go?

799
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:04,390
Where did it go?

800
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:05,830
Oh, there it is.

801
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:11,870
Yay!

802
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:13,550
Are you having fun?

803
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:14,690
I'm glad.

804
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,030
I was so surprised.

805
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:19,990
I didn't expect you to be so cautious.

806
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,690
We are like that.

807
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,730
Let's go over there.

808
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,730
Let's go over there.

809
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,850
Those three are opposite 3P.

810
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,370
We are opposite 3P.

811
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,430
You are right.

812
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,390
You are right.

813
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:49,990
We are 6P.

814
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:50,350
Let's go together.

815
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:51,510
No, no, no.

816
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,590
We'll get mixed up.

817
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,530
I guess so.

818
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,410
We've booked a hotel,
so we can't fit everyone.

819
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,270
There's a heart.

820
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,230
It's cute.

821
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,180
Who's got a heart?

822
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:12,690
Concentrate.

823
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,050
Everyone's got a heart.

824
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,130
Everyone's got a heart.

825
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,890
It's cute, isn't it, Mai-chan?

826
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,750
It's like a sunflower.

827
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,770
It's different from the previous one.

828
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:31,560
What's this?

829
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:32,680
Goldfish?

830
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,940
It's like a aquarium.

831
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,320
What's this?

832
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,991
Everyone is looking over there.

833
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,640
Sometimes there are
fish that react like this.

834
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:43,860
Yes, there are.

835
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:44,820
They are looking at us.

836
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,360
Aren't they looking at us a lot?

837
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:48,210
Can they see us?

838
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,600
Yes, they can.

839
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:50,601
I see two of them.

840
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,460
I see three and four of them.

841
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Do you see them?

842
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,520
I see them a lot.

843
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,440
I see them a lot.

844
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,800
I feel sorry for them.

845
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
I feel sorry for them.

846
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,620
It's funny.

847
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,040
Is it a goldfish?

848
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,160
It's a pink fish.

849
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
Did you say fish?

850
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,500
What?

851
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,780
Did you say goldfish?

852
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:18,120
What is it? Fish?

853
01:15:19,085 --> 01:15:20,446
Goldfish is also a fish, isn't it?

854
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,980
No, it's a kind of fish.

855
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,440
It's a kind of fish.

856
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,720
I don't know what it is.

857
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,400
I thought you were just apologizing.

858
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,080
No, I thought you were looking down on me.

859
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,180
Mai-chan, I don't look
down on you in such a place.

860
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,100
But isn't it good to
have a thrill like that?

861
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,200
What is it?

862
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,020
Like going to a park
where there are people.

863
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:43,600
Really?

864
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:44,601
What do you mean by that?

865
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,060
I like that too.

866
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,280
Oh, is that so?

867
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:52,360
I want to kiss someone.

868
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,580
What?

869
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,140
It's exciting, isn't it?

870
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,640
Yeah.

871
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,520
I'm embarrassed.

872
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:08,540
Oh, she's here.

873
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,600
Oh, she's here.

874
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,700
She didn't see me, did she?

875
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,240
Hold on a second.

876
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,500
To the left and right.

877
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,940
Let me kiss you.

878
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,600
I'm embarrassed.

879
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,060
Mai-chan said she was nervous.

880
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,260
I was taken to dessert after dessert.

881
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,660
I'm embarrassed.

882
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,850
It suits you.

883
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,960
I thought you were going to start dancing.

884
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,250
That's a zombie.

885
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:59,010
There is a zombie here.

886
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:00,990
Yes, there is.

887
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,890
Did you hide it because it was a lie?

888
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:06,510
The real one is in New York.

889
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,490
There was a zombie here.

890
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:13,190
Let's do it again.

891
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:14,790
Let's do it again.

892
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:17,390
Great.

893
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,710
It's amazing.

894
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:21,890
It was here.

895
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,050
That's why it's not in New York now.

896
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,810
No, no, no.

897
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:27,830
I was about to be deceived for a moment.

898
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,910
I brought it by ship from New York.

899
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,350
It's a big deal.

900
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,410
The next day.

901
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,050
It's very cold.

902
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,110
Is it cold?

903
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,410
It looks delicious again.

904
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:40,290
It's delicious.

905
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,690
It's cold.

906
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,030
I brought it.

907
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,470
Welcome!

908
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,140
Good evening.

909
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,210
I've been waiting for you.

910
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,710
Are you drinking already?

911
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:56,630
Yes, we are.

912
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:57,631
Thank you.

913
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:58,770
Do you want to drink?

914
01:17:58,970 --> 01:17:59,970
Yes, I do.

915
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:01,710
Which one do you want?

916
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:03,671
Let's toast to the beautiful night view.

917
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:05,810
Cheers!

918
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,170
Cheers, Maruyama-chan.

919
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:08,650
Cheers.

920
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:13,710
You can do it.

921
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,440
You can do it.

922
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,070
I just did it.

923
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,990
You can do it.

924
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,330
Can you do it from here?

925
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,210
Don't be naughty.

926
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,670
You can do it.

927
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,730
You can do it.

928
01:18:32,731 --> 01:18:33,930
Oh!

929
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,610
Oh!

930
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:38,050
It's funny.

931
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,550
Can I lick it?

932
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,210
Oh!

933
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:43,650
Oh!

934
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:47,330
It's delicious champagne.

935
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,150
It's cute.

936
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:50,950
Are you okay?

937
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,290
Yes, I'm fine.

938
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:55,570
Oh!

939
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:57,590
Oh!

940
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:59,370
It's cute to lick.

941
01:18:59,371 --> 01:19:00,371
It's good, isn't it?

942
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,050
Is it good?

943
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,810
It's good.

944
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:16,720
You can drink it with your mouth.

945
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,120
I can't drink it with my mouth.

946
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,540
Put it in your mouth.

947
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:28,180
You're in the way.

948
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,040
He wants to drink it.

949
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,300
You should do like this.

950
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:37,100
I'll do it.

951
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,740
Let him drink it from the top.

952
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,600
Stand up.

953
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:46,010
Don't be shy.

954
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,020
He's getting closer.

955
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,000
How is it?

956
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,170
Graccia!

957
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,500
Graccia!

958
01:20:02,501 --> 01:20:03,501
What language is that?

959
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,300
Graccia is Italian.

960
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,120
That was too fast.

961
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,000
I said it as soon as you started.

962
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,340
Graccia.

963
01:20:16,341 --> 01:20:17,920
A man with a shield has to be a grudge.

964
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,880
A man with a shield.

965
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,420
You're a man with a shield.

966
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,960
I brought something good.

967
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,200
This is a swimsuit.

968
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,900
It's cute.

969
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,800
It's pink.

970
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,880
It's a present.

971
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,520
Shocking pink.

972
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,840
Shocking pink.

973
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It looks good on you.

974
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,980
Where did you buy it?

975
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:41,460
Gyaru.

976
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,700
It's nice, isn't it?

977
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:48,740
If you don't mind, could you please stand
up for a moment and change your clothes?

978
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,680
I think it's good.

979
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,680
I think it's good.

980
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,300
It's cute.

981
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,600
Do you want me to wear it?

982
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,700
Do you want me to wear it?

983
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:58,020
Do you want me to change my clothes?

984
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,140
Do you want me to change my clothes?

985
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,180
It's hard to look like this.

986
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,680
Can I ask you a favor here?

987
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,180
Can I ask you a favor here?

988
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:06,400
Can I?

989
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,560
Can I?

990
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,160
What are you doing?

991
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:10,161
What are you doing?

992
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,040
You don't like it?

993
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:13,220
It's embarrassing.

994
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:16,500
But I like your style.

995
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,320
What?

996
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,140
Do you have small panties?

997
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,540
It's a micro bikini.

998
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:35,720
I don't have it.

999
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:36,420
No, I didn't.

1000
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:36,760
Why?

1001
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,280
You were so cute just now.

1002
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,580
I left it behind.

1003
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,160
You left it behind?

1004
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:42,780
Yes.

1005
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:43,520
Really?

1006
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,760
Because it's a duet.

1007
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,220
Oh, it's a button.

1008
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,280
It's not a button.

1009
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,780
It's always like this.

1010
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:54,740
Really?

1011
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,600
You're a pervert.

1012
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:58,700
Really?

1013
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,960
It's always like this?

1014
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,380
Yes, I took it off just now.

1015
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,240
I took it off.

1016
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,980
You were taking it off a while ago.

1017
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:13,520
Why did you take it off?

1018
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,120
I wanted to surprise you.

1019
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,300
You got caught.

1020
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,540
It's a surprise.

1021
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,860
There's not a single grain of cake.

1022
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:45,650
I'm getting excited.

1023
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,850
Can I touch it?

1024
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,010
I'm getting hot.

1025
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:57,190
You're getting hot?

1026
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:58,950
You're getting drunk, aren't you?

1027
01:22:59,090 --> 01:22:59,870
Do you want a drink?

1028
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:03,190
Let's have a drink while we change.

1029
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,600
It's good.

1030
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:08,251
The taste is different, isn't it?

1031
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:10,270
It's good.

1032
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:11,930
Is it different?

1033
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,050
It's easier to drink than before.

1034
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:17,670
What do you mean?

1035
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:19,910
It's easier to drink than before.

1036
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,230
What do you mean?

1037
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,650
The characters are like that.

1038
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,310
This is a happening bar.

1039
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,270
In this state.

1040
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,590
In this state.

1041
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:33,710
Everyone's voice is spinning fast.

1042
01:23:35,085 --> 01:23:36,110
It's good.

1043
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:37,770
It's the best.

1044
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,370
Do you know how to wear it?

1045
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:40,950
How do you wear it?

1046
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,910
Like this.

1047
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:46,270
You don't have this, do you?

1048
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:47,670
You wear it like this.

1049
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:53,510
How is it?

1050
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:55,710
Can you move this up a little bit?

1051
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,470
Oh, that's good.

1052
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,130
That's good.

1053
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:00,510
I don't like it.

1054
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:03,926
Do you want me to stretch it?

1055
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:07,150
Yes.

1056
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,930
Your hair looks good, too.

1057
01:24:14,931 --> 01:24:15,931
How about this?

1058
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,320
Oh, that's good.

1059
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,050
It looks good on you.

1060
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:20,290
Thank you.

1061
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:21,850
Thank you.

1062
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,230
He's doing something like a Showa gag.

1063
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,260
I want to see a gag-like pose.

1064
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,140
A gag-like pose?

1065
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,580
I have something.

1066
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,480
This is a trend.

1067
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,920
Wow!

1068
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,520
Wow!

1069
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,560
TikTok.

1070
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,320
It's a trend.

1071
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:48,321
This is my sofa.

1072
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,580
It looks good on you.

1073
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,640
How about a face heart?

1074
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,460
A face heart?

1075
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,960
This is called a pig heart.

1076
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:05,010
Pig?

1077
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,060
It's not a pig, is it?

1078
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,280
It's a pig.

1079
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,660
Is it a pig heart?

1080
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,640
He's sweating a lot.

1081
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:21,740
He's getting drunk.

1082
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:24,720
He's sweating a lot.

1083
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:28,580
He's sweating a lot.

1084
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:31,040
You should have told me if you were sober.

1085
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:36,636
You should have told me if you were sober.

1086
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:40,040
If you're drunk, you'll know what to do.

1087
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,920
It would be great if
this gal went to the sea.

1088
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:44,696
It would be great if we
could go to the beach.

1089
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,660
The sea and the pool are beautiful.

1090
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,380
What do you use in the pool?

1091
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,660
Please tell me where you
want me to touch more.

1092
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,430
It's so smooth.

1093
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:10,550
It's embarrassing.

1094
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,630
You look like you're about to die.

1095
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:16,170
I'm sweating a little.

1096
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:17,670
Are you sweating?

1097
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:20,070
I love this place.

1098
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,170
I love it.

1099
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,180
She is licking my armpit sweat.

1100
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:38,560
Because it's so cute.

1101
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,760
I like armpit sweat.

1102
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,920
A cat that licks a cat's leg.

1103
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:29,340
Do you like being licked?

1104
01:27:33,235 --> 01:27:34,600
Kitten, how should I lick you?

1105
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:51,690
Good boy.

1106
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:14,260
I'll touch your butt.

1107
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:18,580
I'll touch your butt.

1108
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:29,580
I'll put more ointment on your butt.

1109
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,580
Wow, it's amazing.

1110
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,100
It's amazing.

1111
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:40,101
Wow.

1112
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,100
It's shining.

1113
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,240
It is.

1114
01:28:47,785 --> 01:28:54,060
It's really shiny.

1115
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,300
It's amazing.

1116
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,640
I can't stop.

1117
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,130
It's fun.

1118
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,230
The wheel looks great on you.

1119
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,710
Yeah.

1120
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,920
I'm going to apply it to your nails.

1121
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:48,600
I'm going to apply it to your nails.

1122
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:58,400
I'm going to apply it to your nails.

1123
01:29:58,401 --> 01:29:58,620
How do you feel?

1124
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,500
What's going on with you?

1125
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:06,560
Why do you like her so much?

1126
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:10,320
Maya is very seductive.

1127
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:25,010
Maya, where are you touching?

1128
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,060
Where are you touching?

1129
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,700
I'll be there soon.

1130
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,820
I'm going to put my hand in there.

1131
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,910
What's going on there?

1132
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,930
What's going on?

1133
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:20,620
Oh, that's what it feels like.

1134
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:27,980
He's purring.

1135
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:35,310
I'm sorry.

1136
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:55,790
You are really a mess.

1137
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,840
Your eyes are drooping.

1138
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:34,180
I have a lot of pee.

1139
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:37,680
There are so many, so it's okay
to do it one by one, so it feels good.

1140
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,880
It feels so good.

1141
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:16,260
You're all over the place
right now, aren't you?

1142
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:34,260
You're all over the place.

1143
01:33:34,261 --> 01:33:35,261
Oh, it hurts.

1144
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:45,100
Your tongue is long,
so it feels really good.

1145
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,160
Look this way.

1146
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:10,980
It's a face that is so cute!

1147
01:34:10,981 --> 01:34:11,981
Why don't you pet me?

1148
01:34:15,635 --> 01:34:18,300
I'm a huge fan of you!

1149
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:22,920
I'll hold you.

1150
01:34:22,921 --> 01:34:23,921
Do you like it?

1151
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,070
Wow.

1152
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,390
It feels good.

1153
01:34:38,391 --> 01:34:39,391
Hmm.

1154
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,800
Hmm.

1155
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,520

Let me lick your teeth Hmm Yes.

1159
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:33,180
Can I warm your back?

1160
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:35,460
Yes.

1161
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,500
Are you thirsty?

1162
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,600
Yes.

1163
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:45,900
Do you want some water?

1164
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:49,660
Yes.

1165
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:06,520
It's delicious.

1166
01:36:06,521 --> 01:36:07,521
Is it delicious?

1167
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,780
If you eat a lot of
food, you will be licked.

1168
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:46,320
Where are you licking?

1169
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:55,320
Where are you licking, Mai-chan?

1170
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,640
My butthole.

1171
01:37:05,470 --> 01:37:06,470
How does it taste?

1172
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:12,030
It's good.

1173
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,310
Does it taste bitter?

1174
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:16,250
Bitter?

1175
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,710
It's good.

1176
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,270
You can do it κακάα Like this.

01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:15,630
It's amazing.

1181
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:32,050
Can I see you for a moment?

1182
01:38:39,275 --> 01:38:40,470
How are you?

1183
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:41,970
I'm fine.

1184
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:49,250
It's good to have a lot.

1185
01:38:49,251 --> 01:38:50,811
Do you want me to put it in your mouth?

1186
01:39:10,465 --> 01:39:15,420
Do you want to stop eating?

1187
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:26,830
No, I don't want to.

1188
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:29,450
You are eating in a pleasant place.

1189
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,250
It's okay.

1190
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:12,230
It's okay.

1191
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,250
It's okay.

1192
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:58,380
The baby is crying.

1193
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,980
I've got a lot of blood in the baby's eye.

1194
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:28,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1195
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,700
Oh, you're pushing.

1196
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,600
You're pushing.

1197
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1198
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:49,940
It's like a pillow.

1199
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,620
It's like a pillow.

1200
01:41:54,621 --> 01:41:55,740
It's slippery.

1201
01:41:55,741 --> 01:41:56,900

02:33:52,585 --> 02:34:13,580
Will you try rubbing his puffy face?

1373
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:16,860
Rub it?

1374
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:25,600
Put a lot of acupuncture
points on your feet.

1375
02:34:26,025 --> 02:34:39,960
Put a lot of acupuncture
points on your feet.

1376
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:13,370
Does it feel good if you put it in?

1377
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:17,110
Don't you want to put it in if you push it?

1378
02:35:18,050 --> 02:35:20,910
I want to put it
in Can't I put it in?

1379
02:35:21,390 --> 02:35:22,550
Put it in as it is.

1380
02:35:24,930 --> 02:35:27,350
I can't do it anymore.

1381
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:39,180
I can't do it anymore.

1382
02:35:41,310 --> 02:35:59,490
I can't do it anymore.

1383
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:06,380
I'm getting angry.

1384
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:09,360
Oh, no.

1385
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:10,020
Oh, no.

1386
02:36:10,021 --> 02:36:11,021
I'm so angry.

1387
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:13,840
I'm sensitive because I'm sick.

1388
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:43,840
Oh, no.

1389
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:51,400
Oh, no.

1390
02:37:00,300 --> 02:37:02,360
You're moving a lot.

1391
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:24,950
It's uncomfortable.

1392
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:44,970
I can't do this.

1393
02:37:52,160 --> 02:38:21,450
I can't do this.

1394
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:32,400
I can't do it here.

1395
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:38,480
I can't do it here.

1396
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,280
I'm going.

1397
02:40:01,470 --> 02:40:02,250
You're in a lot of pain.

1398
02:40:02,251 --> 02:40:03,251
Are you nervous?

1399
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:35,850
How do you feel?

1400
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:00,880
Oh, it's hot!

1401
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:03,700
Oh, it's hot!

1402
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:05,720
Oh, it's hot!

1403
02:41:07,370 --> 02:41:09,080
Oh, it's hot!

1404
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:20,856
It's easier to breathe if you go once.

1405
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:21,880
Oh, it feels good.

1406
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:25,300
Oh, it feels good.

1407
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:27,280
I'll let you go.

1408
02:41:27,281 --> 02:41:27,460

1409
02:41:27,461 --> 02:41:28,461

1410
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:09,410
I'm sorry.

1411
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:27,590
I'm going to cry.

1412
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:28,410
I'm going to cry.

1413
02:43:28,411 --> 02:43:29,411
Let's go.

1414
02:43:36,030 --> 02:43:38,080
I'm going to cry.

1415
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:16,220
Let's shake hands.

1416
02:44:17,165 --> 02:44:20,840
I don't feel good.

1417
02:44:22,120 --> 02:44:23,120
I'll put you on my lap.

1418
02:45:46,850 --> 02:45:47,850
Do you feel good?

1419
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:33,300
I can't do it anymore.

1420
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:36,300
I can't do it anymore.

1421
02:46:38,580 --> 02:46:43,240
I can't do it anymore.

1422
02:46:56,500 --> 02:46:57,500
It feels weird.

1423
02:46:58,450 --> 02:47:00,290
It feels weird.

1424
02:47:32,360 --> 02:47:33,380
Are you sleeping?

1425
02:47:35,220 --> 02:47:36,260
Are you awake?

1426
02:47:36,261 --> 02:47:37,261
Are you sleeping?

1427
02:48:17,915 --> 02:49:31,080

02:49:51,220 --> 02:50:55,560
I can't do it at all.

1429
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:11,900
I'll move you a lot.

1430
02:51:22,865 --> 02:51:26,320
I'm sorry, I'll go to the doctor's office.

1431
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:33,620
I'm sorry.

1432
02:51:35,350 --> 02:51:36,360
I'm sorry.

1433
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:38,820
I'm sorry.

1434
02:51:47,960 --> 02:51:49,000
I'm really going.

1435
02:52:20,710 --> 02:52:30,910
I'm really going.

1436
02:52:30,911 --> 02:52:31,911
You can do it.

1437
02:52:33,830 --> 02:52:35,390
Thank you.

1438
02:52:37,170 --> 02:52:38,170
You're right.

1439
02:52:39,130 --> 02:52:39,350
You're so cute.

1440
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:40,890
I gave you a lot.

1441
02:52:45,170 --> 02:52:52,800
Are you satisfied?

1442
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:54,120
Is it not enough?

1443
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:55,540
No, it's not enough.

1444
02:53:01,330 --> 02:53:06,600
Can you lick me a little?

1445
02:53:06,601 --> 02:53:07,601
Can you do it again?

1446
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:13,140
Do you want to do it again?

1447
02:53:14,260 --> 02:53:15,540
I want to do it again.

1448
02:53:29,090 --> 02:53:35,420
Look at his head I'm sorry
for the trouble you're in.

1449
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:40,480
I'm sorry for the trouble you're in.

1450
02:53:45,250 --> 02:54:04,780
Can you put it in?

1451
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:23,050
It's squeezed.

1452
02:54:32,410 --> 02:54:33,810
You are sleepy, aren't you?

1453
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:59,400
I'm going to clean your ears.

1454
02:55:08,420 --> 02:55:10,000
I'm done.

1455
02:55:13,325 --> 02:55:19,280
Can I take your ears off?

1456
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:55,810
I can't take it anymore.

1457
02:55:58,670 --> 02:56:00,890
I can't take it anymore.

1458
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:21,480
I'm so nervous.

1459
02:56:21,481 --> 02:56:22,481
I'm so sleepy.

1460
02:56:29,270 --> 02:56:43,540
I'm out of my mind.

1461
02:56:48,830 --> 02:57:00,530
I fell asleep.

1462
02:57:51,100 --> 02:57:52,100
Good morning!

1463
02:57:53,250 --> 02:57:54,250
It's morning.

1464
02:57:57,200 --> 02:58:01,050
Can you see the breakfast in front of me?

1465
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:03,270
Ta-da!

1466
02:58:03,271 --> 02:58:04,271
Ta-da!

1467
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:06,070
Here it is.

1468
02:58:06,250 --> 02:58:07,250
Looks good.

1469
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:11,120
Just a glance.

1470
02:58:14,330 --> 02:58:15,330
Looks good.

1471
02:58:23,860 --> 02:58:24,860
Oh!

1472
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:26,320
I spilled it.

1473
02:58:27,700 --> 02:58:28,880
How is it?

1474
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:29,320
It's good.

1475
02:58:29,860 --> 02:58:31,700
I spilled something.

1476
02:58:34,880 --> 02:58:35,880
Isn't this cute?

1477
02:58:36,440 --> 02:58:37,440
Which one?

1478
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:39,220
Oh!

1479
02:58:39,221 --> 02:58:40,221
Hey!

1480
02:58:41,320 --> 02:58:43,000
What is this? Panda? Bear?

1481
02:58:43,300 --> 02:58:44,300
What is this?

1482
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:46,960
Doesn't it look like a panda?

1483
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:49,660
It's a cute panda.

1484
02:58:50,380 --> 02:58:52,160
It's really cute.

1485
02:58:53,100 --> 02:58:54,920
I've never seen such a cute panda.

1486
02:58:55,800 --> 02:58:56,880
You're kidding.

1487
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:57,600
Don't you think so?

1488
02:58:58,250 --> 02:58:59,650
You said it was a bear, didn't you?

1489
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,800
It looks like a panda to me, too.

1490
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:06,520
It can be a panda or a bear.

1491
02:59:06,521 --> 02:59:07,521
Mayonnaise.

1492
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:15,060
What's your favorite food?

1493
02:59:16,100 --> 02:59:16,900
Tomatoes.

1494
02:59:17,060 --> 02:59:18,060
What else?

1495
02:59:18,880 --> 02:59:19,880
Grilled meat.

1496
02:59:21,940 --> 02:59:23,060
Tomatoes.

1497
02:59:23,750 --> 02:59:24,750
Are you going back?

1498
02:59:26,200 --> 02:59:27,320
Tomatoes.

1499
02:59:28,870 --> 02:59:29,876
Tomatoes and grilled meat are rare.

1500
02:59:29,900 --> 02:59:31,740
There are many people
who don't like tomatoes.

1501
02:59:36,450 --> 02:59:37,570
Dressing.

1502
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:40,140
Dressing is this.

1503
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:42,770
Salt and pepper.

1504
02:59:43,690 --> 02:59:45,050
It's good as it is.

1505
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:45,970
Is it good?

1506
02:59:46,310 --> 02:59:46,470
Yes.

1507
02:59:47,330 --> 02:59:58,480
Do you have any dressing?

1508
02:59:58,580 --> 02:59:59,140
Dressing?

1509
02:59:59,420 --> 02:59:59,600
This?

1510
02:59:59,780 --> 03:00:00,180
This?

1511
03:00:00,181 --> 03:00:01,181
This?

1512
03:00:01,640 --> 03:00:02,640
This is maple.

1513
03:00:03,080 --> 03:00:04,080
This is honey.

1514
03:00:04,860 --> 03:00:05,860
Honey?

1515
03:00:06,040 --> 03:00:07,040
Yes.

1516
03:00:07,620 --> 03:00:08,940
It's a luxurious breakfast.

1517
03:00:09,810 --> 03:00:11,170
Do you eat this kind of breakfast?

1518
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:13,240
In the morning?

1519
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:15,020
In the morning...

1520
03:00:16,380 --> 03:00:17,380
Yes.

1521
03:00:18,230 --> 03:00:18,920
What do you eat for breakfast?

1522
03:00:18,921 --> 03:00:20,401
What kind of food do you like to eat?

1523
03:00:20,520 --> 03:00:27,560
I like simple food like mentaiko,
nori seaweed, and egg on rice.

1524
03:00:38,730 --> 03:00:39,350
I've been curious about this.

1525
03:00:39,620 --> 03:00:41,970
There is a punishment game.

1526
03:00:44,130 --> 03:00:46,290
Would you like to play the game?

1527
03:00:47,230 --> 03:00:48,250
I want to play it.

1528
03:00:48,590 --> 03:00:48,870
Really?

1529
03:00:48,871 --> 03:00:49,050
Is that so?

1530
03:00:49,450 --> 03:00:50,650
It's a penalty game, isn't it?

1531
03:00:51,110 --> 03:00:51,570
It's a penalty game.

1532
03:00:51,571 --> 03:00:53,651
It's a penalty game to eat
extremely spicy yakisoba.

1533
03:00:55,570 --> 03:00:57,310
What's that?

1534
03:00:57,311 --> 03:00:58,311
What's that?

1535
03:00:58,590 --> 03:00:59,370
It's a bitter one.

1536
03:00:59,490 --> 03:01:00,676
It's the first time in
a long time, isn't it?

1537
03:01:00,700 --> 03:01:04,250
But this yakisoba is
more like a penalty game.

1538
03:01:05,080 --> 03:01:06,800
It's definitely a very spicy one, isn't it?

1539
03:01:07,270 --> 03:01:08,590
Let's eat it if you lose.

1540
03:01:08,890 --> 03:01:09,890
Yes.

1541
03:01:09,970 --> 03:01:10,970
Oh, I'm scared.

1542
03:01:12,650 --> 03:01:13,650
This is...

1543
03:01:14,370 --> 03:01:15,190
Oh, it's fast.

1544
03:01:15,330 --> 03:01:16,350
Men eat it, too.

1545
03:01:16,351 --> 03:01:17,351
Wow!

1546
03:01:17,470 --> 03:01:18,470
That was fast.

1547
03:01:19,350 --> 03:01:20,350
So fast!

1548
03:01:21,490 --> 03:01:22,570
I'm getting a heart attack.

1549
03:01:23,110 --> 03:01:24,110
You are?

1550
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:26,480
I'm scared.

1551
03:01:34,010 --> 03:01:35,270
I'm really scared.

1552
03:01:37,790 --> 03:01:38,970
I'm scared.

1553
03:01:38,990 --> 03:01:39,990
Oh no.

1554
03:01:40,030 --> 03:01:41,030
I'm scared.

1555
03:01:41,560 --> 03:01:42,830
The momentum is important.

1556
03:01:42,950 --> 03:01:43,950
I'm scared.

1557
03:01:43,990 --> 03:01:44,990
Under the black.

1558
03:01:45,830 --> 03:01:48,210
I think... Go!

1559
03:01:48,310 --> 03:01:49,310
Go, go, go!

1560
03:01:49,970 --> 03:01:50,970
I'm sweating a lot.

1561
03:02:00,350 --> 03:02:02,550
I'm scared.

1562
03:02:07,870 --> 03:02:09,010
I'm scared. It's hard.

1563
03:02:09,490 --> 03:02:15,560
I'm scared. It's hard.

1564
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:17,200
Did you feel it?

1565
03:02:17,940 --> 03:02:18,940
It was hard.

1566
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,160
I was surprised.

1567
03:02:24,120 --> 03:02:25,400
Did you feel it?

1568
03:02:26,140 --> 03:02:26,600
Yes.

1569
03:02:26,601 --> 03:02:30,880
I can't eat all of it.

1570
03:02:36,555 --> 03:02:38,200
Which one should I eat?

1571
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:39,800
This one?

1572
03:02:51,270 --> 03:02:53,570
Wow, look at the color.

1573
03:02:55,850 --> 03:02:57,150
Is it red and black?

1574
03:03:02,390 --> 03:03:03,550
You're very careful.

1575
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:12,680
It looks delicious.

1576
03:03:15,070 --> 03:03:16,480
Wow, it's spicy.

1577
03:03:16,481 --> 03:03:17,520
Oh, it's coming.

1578
03:03:24,910 --> 03:03:25,910
Oh, my God.

1579
03:03:26,210 --> 03:03:27,210
Wait a minute.

1580
03:03:28,100 --> 03:03:29,100
It's coming later.

1581
03:03:29,290 --> 03:03:31,810
I'm thirsty.

1582
03:03:32,470 --> 03:03:33,810
Don't you sweat a lot?

1583
03:03:34,330 --> 03:03:35,330
I don't sweat that much.

1584
03:03:35,410 --> 03:03:36,750
Can't you see it?

1585
03:03:37,230 --> 03:03:38,970
Oh, my God.

1586
03:03:39,130 --> 03:03:40,130
It's spicy.

1587
03:03:41,810 --> 03:03:42,890
Oh, my God.

1588
03:03:44,650 --> 03:03:46,230
It hurts after drinking.

1589
03:03:46,330 --> 03:03:47,330
It hurts.

1590
03:03:47,450 --> 03:03:48,850
My gums hurt, too.

1591
03:03:48,851 --> 03:03:49,851
What? Are you serious?

1592
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:53,580
If it's hot, you should take it off.

1593
03:03:53,810 --> 03:03:54,810
You can take it off.

1594
03:03:57,310 --> 03:03:58,310
It's really dry.

1595
03:03:59,210 --> 03:04:00,210
You should take it off.

1596
03:04:01,355 --> 03:04:02,715
It's hot. My armpits are sweating.

1597
03:04:03,030 --> 03:04:03,250
Your armpits?

1598
03:04:03,550 --> 03:04:05,590
It's going to get dirty,
so you should take it off.

1599
03:04:06,670 --> 03:04:07,670
You should take it off.

1600
03:04:08,530 --> 03:04:09,250
Right now?

1601
03:04:09,510 --> 03:04:10,530
Yes. It's hot, isn't it?

1602
03:04:13,790 --> 03:04:14,270
It's hot.

1603
03:04:14,610 --> 03:04:15,890
You're always naked, aren't you?

1604
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:20,840
If you take it off, you'll
eat a little more, won't you?

1605
03:04:21,860 --> 03:04:23,470
I'll eat it later.

1606
03:04:24,210 --> 03:04:25,210
I'm so embarrassed.

1607
03:04:26,730 --> 03:04:28,390
It's so hot.

1608
03:04:29,110 --> 03:04:32,010
If I eat a few of these, I'll die.

1609
03:04:34,440 --> 03:04:35,890
Rock-paper-scissors.

1610
03:04:37,490 --> 03:04:38,490
Rock-paper-scissors.

1611
03:04:41,250 --> 03:04:43,050
Let me eat it.

1612
03:04:43,051 --> 03:04:44,051
Please do.

1613
03:04:44,430 --> 03:04:45,610
I think we have a lot of food.

1614
03:04:45,630 --> 03:04:46,590
Yeah, I'm jealous.
I think we have a lot of food.

1615
03:04:46,591 --> 03:04:47,970
We can't eat it until it's over.

1616
03:04:48,350 --> 03:04:50,010
We can't eat it until it's over.

1617
03:04:51,090 --> 03:04:52,090
Please try just one.

1618
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:54,650
Yeah, I'll try a little more.

1619
03:04:56,370 --> 03:04:57,290
It wasn't good at first.

1620
03:04:57,291 --> 03:04:58,651
No, it's been good from the start!

1621
03:04:58,750 --> 03:05:10,290
Really? No, it's been good from the start!

1622
03:05:10,960 --> 03:05:11,960
Here it is.

1623
03:05:13,690 --> 03:05:14,690
Wow!

1624
03:05:15,330 --> 03:05:16,330
It's huge.

1625
03:05:16,790 --> 03:05:17,270
It's open.

1626
03:05:17,430 --> 03:05:17,990
It's huge.

1627
03:05:17,991 --> 03:05:19,970
Show me your face.

1628
03:05:25,240 --> 03:05:26,460
What is this?

1629
03:05:28,580 --> 03:05:29,760
This is the other side.

1630
03:05:53,870 --> 03:05:58,850
Show me your butt.

1631
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:34,020
You came out of yourself.

1632
03:07:42,880 --> 03:07:43,880
You are quiet.

1633
03:07:44,745 --> 03:08:27,490
I'm going to give you a shot.

1634
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:29,750
I'm very embarrassed.

1635
03:08:51,700 --> 03:08:53,790
Do you like my finger?

1636
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:56,730
Do you like my finger?

1637
03:12:24,090 --> 03:12:25,480
I'm sorry.

1638
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:30,660
I'm sorry.

1639
03:13:02,690 --> 03:13:04,230
I'm sorry.

1640
03:13:24,240 --> 03:13:25,960
I'm sorry.

1641
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:41,460
I'm sorry.

1642
03:13:41,461 --> 03:14:07,340
Do you want to drink water?

1643
03:14:53,980 --> 03:14:54,980
Yes.

1644
03:15:01,580 --> 03:15:03,800
You like to lick, don't you?

1645
03:15:06,190 --> 03:15:09,360
You like to lick fingers
and tongue, don't you?

1646
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:12,300
Do you like to lick?

1647
03:15:17,540 --> 03:15:18,270
You like to lick, don't you?

1648
03:15:18,350 --> 03:15:19,770
Yes, I do.

1649
03:15:20,320 --> 03:15:21,320
I want to lick you.

1650
03:15:23,790 --> 03:15:24,790
Yes, I do.

1651
03:15:33,900 --> 03:15:36,910
Oh, wow, you're tied up.

1652
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:44,570
Do you want me to put a bandage on you?

1653
03:15:45,030 --> 03:15:47,630
No, I don't.

1654
03:15:47,880 --> 03:15:49,800
Do you want me to put a
bandage on you directly?

1655
03:15:53,070 --> 03:15:54,070
Oh, wow.

1656
03:15:58,840 --> 03:16:02,860
Oh, wow.

1657
03:16:02,861 --> 03:16:03,861
Ah.

1658
03:16:09,445 --> 03:16:10,445
Ah.

1659
03:16:11,180 --> 03:16:14,130
There's no point in tying
it up You've grabbed a lot

1660
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:17,770
Ah As it is.

1661

Thank you.

1668
03:20:04,045 --> 03:20:13,330
I can't do it.

1669
03:20:17,590 --> 03:20:30,860
Do you like to be touched by me?

1670
03:20:31,060 --> 03:20:32,240
No, I don't like it.

1671
03:20:32,380 --> 03:20:35,680
I'll put my hand on your hip.

1672
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:50,680
Do you feel good?

1673
03:20:53,710 --> 03:20:55,120
I can't do it.

1674
03:21:04,265 --> 03:21:05,380
