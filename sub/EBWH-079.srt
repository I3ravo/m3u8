1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,180
The day of the first meeting

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,920
This is a very nice store.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,660
Where do you work? I'm a clerk.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,340


5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
You are very smart.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,460
You haven't changed.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,660
I haven't changed.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,140
Long time no see.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,260
It's been a long time.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,040
It's been a long time.

11
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,041
Long time no see.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,400
This shop is so old.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,260
Long time no see.

14
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:37,781
It's been a while since I've seen you.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm so nervous.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,640
It's been a while since I've seen you.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
I'm so nervous.

18
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm so nervous.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm so nervous.

20
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm so nervous.

21
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm so nervous.

22
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:52,980
I'm so nervous.

23
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:53,100
I'm so nervous.

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm so nervous.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,780
I'm so nervous.

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm so nervous.

27
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm so nervous.

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
I'm so nervous.

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm so nervous.

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,420
I'm so nervous.

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,780
I'm so nervous.

32
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm so nervous.

33
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Let's hang out next time.

34
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,636
If you come here, I'll
take you to eat ramen.

35
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,140
I'm fat, too.

36
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,141
No, you're not.

37
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
Ramen is for hanging out.

38
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,780
It's not just ramen.

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,780
You're drinking, aren't you?

40
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,780
I'm eating good food and
drinking good food, aren't I?

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,100
You can't stand it.

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,880
Long time no see.

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,300
You're still wearing it?

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
Yes.

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Really?

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,780
Yes.

47
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:58,140
What's going on?

48
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,320
It's Shun, isn't it? Yes, it is.

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,680


50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,580
Seriously, why didn't you tell me?

51
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,320
It's Shun, isn't it?

52
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,321
Really?

53
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,460
Since before?

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Since before?

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,420
You guys knew it, didn't you?

56
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,520
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,450
I finally knew it when I got a call today.

58
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,460
Really.

59
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
Is anyone else coming?

60
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Tanaka?

61
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,960
Tanaka can't come today because of work.

62
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:30,700
And then, Yoshino
couldn't get in touch with us.

63
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,800
And then, Himori is coming.

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
He is going back to Tokyo.

65
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,140
Well, everyone, let's order
a drink and have a toast.

66
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
Oh, beer.

67
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,060
Himori was a little late.

68
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,180
Let's have a toast.

69
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:57,100
Let's have a toast.

70
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,720
Cheers!

71
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:05,500
This is delicious.

72
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,770
It's been a long time,
but we're drinking again.

73
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,771
Cheers! I'm sorry.

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,400


75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Don't overdo it.

76
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,620
No, no, I won't.

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
I'll keep going.

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,440
Don't choke on it.

79
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,200
Don't overdo it.

80
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,240
How is it? It hurts.

81
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,660
It hurts a lot.

82
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,880


83
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,620
You drank a lot, didn't you?

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,840
Well, it's been only two years
since we graduated from DOSO.

85
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,280
That's right.

86
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,820
I met Nishino yesterday.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's been a long time.

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,620
Who came up with the idea of this video?

89
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,040
I met him at the spirit ceremony.

90
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,740
We talked about meeting again.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I see.

92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,920
Thank you.

93
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's have fun.

94
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:26,520
It's good.

95
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,481
Don't push yourself too much.

96
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm fine.

97
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,940
Let's order something else.

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm 20 years old now.

99
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,180
Thank you.

100
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,700
Do you want to
challenge? Sounds good.

101
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,520


102
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,780
So, when did you start dating?

103
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,820
I'm going to ask that.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,300
You didn't have a girlfriend
in high school, did you?

105
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,461
You didn't have one, did you?

106
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,421
I've had one since I graduated.

107
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,040
Oh, I see.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I see.

109
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,370
I knew it.

110
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
You knew it? Yes, I knew it.

111
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,060


112
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Why?

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,681
You didn't know him,
did you? No, I told him.

114
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,540


115
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,380
Right?

116
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,020
I didn't know that either.

117
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,500
Did you know him? I knew him.

118
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,560


119
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,400
Why didn't you tell me that you knew him?

120
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,520
You knew him, didn't
you? I knew him.

121
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,256
I'm the only one
who didn't know him?

122
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,900
You knew him?

123
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:25,901
Did you know Kanda?

124
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Did you know Kanda?

125
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,480
Where did you hear it from?

126
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,940
I heard it from the camera.

127
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,660
You heard it from the
camera? Why? I'm sorry.

128
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820


129
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,380
I was wondering where to go.

130
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,096
I was wondering where to go.

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
I was wondering where to go.

132
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,620
Are you taking a break from high fever?

133
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,181
Are you taking a break from high fever?

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,261
But... But...

135
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,420
I've been on a break
from the reunion today.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Yes.

137
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,480
What? Really?

138
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Really?

139
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Yes.

140
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,340
I don't have enough people to come.

141
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,680
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm really sorry.

144
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,540
Well, let's drink again soon.

145
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

146
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Don't worry.

147
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,980
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,540
I'll call you when I get there.

149
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
Okay.

150
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,520
I'll call you.

151
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Take care.

152
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Thank you.

153
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,890
See you later.

154
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
Good luck.

155
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,930
I'll call you.

156
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,510
I'll call you.

157
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,810
Thank you.

158
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,010
Bye.

159
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Cheers!

160
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
Let's get excited for them!

161
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,820
Cheers!

162
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,860
I think this is a book of Sumi Shogi.

163
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,800
It's like a book of Nantezumi.

164
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,620
How many Nantezumi do you have?

165
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,160
Wax? No, there are thousands of them.

166
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:29,920
Really?

167
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
It's really wax.

168
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,785
It's really difficult.

169
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,351
It's like the one you sell
becomes a painting in the end?

170
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Yes.

171
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,240
It's like a beautiful accumulation.

172
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Masamushi? You're late.

173
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880


174
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
Where are you?

175
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,640
Turn right there.

176
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
There it is, right? Yes, there.

177
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Wait.

178
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,501
I feel like I'm
in love with you.

179
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Who is it? Himori.

180
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,780
He's coming soon.

181
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Himori.

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,500
Himori is coming soon.

183
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,580
I heard he's coming.

184
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,500
I didn't know him.

185
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
It's been 2 years.

186
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
I don't know him.

187
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
I don't know anyone.

188
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
I don't know anyone.

189
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Where is he from?

190
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,440
University?

191
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,960
He's not from here.

192
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:18,961
He's not from here.

193
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,540
It's hard to recognize his name.

194
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,980
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

195
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:23,981
Oh, you're here.

196
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,880
Long time no see.

197
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Long time no see.

198
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
You're late.

199
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
That's right.

200
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,160
You haven't changed much.

201
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Can I go to the bathroom?

202
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,920
You can go to the bathroom.

203
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,320
There's still some food left, so go ahead.

204
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Long time no see.

205
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
It's good.

206
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,510
This is my favorite.

207
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,330
That's good.

208
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,410
It looks delicious.

209
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,070
It's almost gone.

210
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:03,150
It's been a long time.

211
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
It's true.

212
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,150
You don't contact me at all.

213
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,910
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,930
I'm quite busy studying.

215
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,130
Are you self-taught?

216
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,430
No, I'm not self-taught.

217
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,310
Did you go to university
today? Yes, I did.

218
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,350
It's a big school.

219
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,010
It's amazing.

220
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,610
It's a souvenir of Kyoto.

221
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,630
What about tea sweets?

222
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,190
Tea sweets?

223
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,250
I wanted a matcha donut.

224
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,990
It's a fat trigger.

225
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,690
It's a fat trigger of Kyoto.

226
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,630
It's like a candy.

227
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,050
It's like a candy.

228
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,690
It's like a candy.

229
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:39,710
It's like a candy.

230
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,150
I've never been to Kyoto.

231
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,770
Really?

232
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,410
Did you go to middle school?

233
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,910
Middle school?

234
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,490
Middle school?

235
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,150
Where did you go? Kamakura.

236
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,730


237
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:52,750
Really?

238
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,470
I was surprised.

239
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,690
Kamakura is good.

240
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,250
Long time no see.

241
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,850
Long time no see.

242
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,110
How have you been?

243
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Himori-kun seems to be
working hard at university.

244
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,679
Well, it's not just that the
Department of Law is attending a

245
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:30,330
lecture, but it's not good if the
score of the exam is not high.

246
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,290
I see.

247
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,210
It seems that you are dating Sekine.

248
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,310
Well, we just started dating.

249
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,150
I see.

250
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,490
I wish I could meet you, Sekine.

251
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,490
I know.

252
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,010
You don't have a girlfriend,
do you? No, I don't.

253
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,150


254
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,390
I'm not in the right place at the moment.

255
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,530
I don't think so.

256
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,860
You've changed.

257
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Have I?

258
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
For example? For example.

259
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
..

260
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,180
I don't know.

261
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,220
I don't know what I'm good at.

262
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
By the way,

263
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,430
your face is red.

264
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Did you already do that?

265
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Really?

266
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,960
I wonder if it's easy to do.

267
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
You look embarrassed.

268
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
It's embarrassing.

269
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,460
Hey, let's take a picture together.

270
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,800
What?

271
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,880
Let's take a picture.

272
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,520
Really?

273
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,160
Yes.

274
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,950
We are going to start the game.

275
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Oh!

276
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
Yeah!

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Did you get it?

278
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
OK!

279
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,620
One, two, three!

280
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,621
Yeah!

281
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,380
Please be more serious, everyone.

282
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,040
You look like you are having fun.

283
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,980
You look like you are having fun.

284
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,340
I want to get it too.

285
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,320
I want to get it too.

286
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,580
You are the one who is responsible.

287
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,420
Kanta, take it properly.

288
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,160
Take it, you.

289
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Don't shake it.

290
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,840
Timing.

291
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
Are you really taking it?

292
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,960
Kanta, you're shaking a lot.

293
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,310
You're shaking a lot.

294
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,660
Iketani, you look cool.

295
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,760
Turn it around.

296
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,280
Turn it into a group.

297
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm going to send this to the group.

298
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:32,040
You can take a break.

299
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,740
What's that?

300
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,540
It's really pink.

301
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,020
This is sour.

302
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:40,740
I have to drink all.

303
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
You left a little.

304
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,480
Don't look at me.

305
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
Are you OK?

306
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Are you OK?

307
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,700
You are shaking.

308
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:55,220
Your face is red, too.

309
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,240
Let's have a break.

310
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,600
Let's wrap it up.

311
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's go.

312
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't push yourself too hard.

313
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,220
It's the last day.

314
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,260
Can we go home? Yes, we can.

315
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,440
Who will go with us? Be careful.

316
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,060
Hey, Hibiki.

317
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,561
Hibiki, are you leaving?
Come back soon.

318
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,180


319
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,400
What about you, Himari?

320
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Me?

321
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,860
I want to show my face to my family.

322
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
So, I'll go home.

323
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,980
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there.

325
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,340
I'll go to Kyoto next time.

326
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:47,240
We are going to Tokyo University.

327
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,240
OK, then, let's go to the second floor.

328
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,240
OK, then, let's go to the second floor.

329
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,180
See you.

330
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
See you.

331
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,860
Are you OK? I'm OK.

332
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,140
Thank you.

333
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,660
Are you OK?

334
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,160
How about everyone?

335
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Everyone?

336
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,160
We are going to the second floor.

337
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I see.

338
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,160
I don't have to go to Himari-kun's house.

339
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
I see.

340
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
I don't want to go.

341
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
I see.

342
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,220
Yes.

343
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
By the way,

344
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
I'll send you home.

345
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Oh, I see.

346
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,360
Yes.

347
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:39,270
My last train...

348
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,190
Oh, I don't have a last train.

349
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,930
I see.

350
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,170
Your house is in Oizumi, isn't it?

351
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,070
Hmm... What should I do?

352
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,590
I think I should go to the bathroom.

353
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,090
I think I should go to the bathroom.

354
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
I don't know what to do.

355
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,590
Get a grip.

356
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,310
I'm going to lose my train of thought.

357
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,550
I see.

358
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,170
I don't have any time to enjoy myself.

359
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,531
I don't have any money for my family.

360
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,090
What should I do?

361
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,370
Should I stay at a hotel?

362
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,390
What?

363
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,910
I heard that the hotel in front
of the station is quite cheap.

364
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,130
Hibiki, do you want to stay there?

365
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,870
No, I don't have that much money.

366
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,410
I don't want to stay there.

367
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,411
It's OK.

368
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,810
I have enough money for two rooms.

369
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,240
Oh.

370
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:01,620
Why is there only one room?

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,040
Well, it's the weekend,
so it's good to have a room.

372
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
That's true.

373
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,010
It's impossible to take a taxi from here.

374
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,890
Here, drink some water.

375
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,320
Hirori-kun, aren't you drunk?

376
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,780
What? I'm drunk, but you're over it.

377
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,320
That's true.

378
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
What? What? Nothing.

379
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280


380
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,810


381
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
So?

382
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,580
What are you going to do?

383
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,060
Do you want me to explain
the situation to you? No, no.

384
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,890
It's not good.

385
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800


386
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,890
I don't want to be misunderstood.

387
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,590
I'm your ex-boyfriend.

388
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,110
I'm going to sleep here.

389
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Don't worry about me.

390
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,900
I usually sleep on the sofa.

392
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Don't worry about me.

393
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,100
You look like you're sick.

394
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,280
Hey, Himori.

395
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,140
You can use half of the bed.

396
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,141
You don't have to use it.

397
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,600
But...

398
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,760
It's really bad.

399
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
I'll give you half of it.

400
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,700
Thank you for your hard work.

401
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,456
Thank you for your hard work.

402
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
You really helped me.

403
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,800
You can give birth today.

404
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,880
Oh, really? OK, thank you.

405
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Thank you.

406
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580


407
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,180
Thank you for your hard work.

408
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
You're welcome.

409
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,560
You don't have to answer the phone.

410
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,140
I'll call you later.

411
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
He's not answering.

412
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,380
I guess he's already gone.

413
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:42,505
Hey, Morimoto.

414
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,010
Are you done with work?

415
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,970
It's 2 o'clock now.

416
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,450
You should come too.

417
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,950
Yeah.

418
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,130
Oh, is Ren there?

419
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,150
Huh?

420
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,090
I think he went home for the anniversary.

421
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,330
Oh, and Himori went home too.

422
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,870
What?

423
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,010
Just the two of you?

424
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,011
Kizu? I don't know.

425
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,250
I didn't notice you.

426
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,530
By the way, Ron is here. Come on.

427
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,330
Hey.

428
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You said...

429
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I've changed.

430
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
In what way?

431
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,210
Were you worried about me?

432
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,300
I wasn't calm before.

433
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,220
I feel calm now.

434
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I didn't feel so calm.

435
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,850
Is that the reason why we broke up?

436
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,750
That's another story.

437
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,850
When I was with you,

438
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,290
I had a lot of fun.

439
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,690
Also, you were so sexy.

440
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,830
I wanted to have a normal date.

441
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,910
You said you didn't want
to because you like me.

442
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,260
I didn't want to make you do it.

443
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,760
Thank you for telling me.

444
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:54,494
I'm still in love with you, so I can't help it

445
00:29:38,425 --> 00:30:22,720
I can't stand it.

446
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,660
Hibiki, lend me your hand.

447
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
It's difficult.

448
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,820
I won't do it like I did before.

449
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:46,590
It's amazing, isn't it?

450
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,870
Don't you throw up?

451
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,840
It's been a long time, so I'll throw up.

452
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,430
I'll throw up.

453
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,340
Of course, I'll definitely
keep it a secret.

454
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,810
I'll throw up.

455
00:45:41,170 --> 00:46:01,580
I can't do it.

456
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,710
I can't do it.

457
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,480
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

458
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:23,800
I'm going to take a bath.

459
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:45,730
I'm going to take a bath.

460
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,700
It's okay.

461
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,480
It was very pleasant.

462
00:54:56,515 --> 00:54:57,820
Really?

463
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,940
It was very pleasant.

464
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,720
It was very pleasant, wasn't it?

465
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:15,820
You are not good at it.

466
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Did you change your mind?

467
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,220
I don't know yet.

468
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,160
I want to make you feel good.

469
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:09,690
I really like you.

470
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:43,260
I love you.

471
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,350
You are so beautiful.

472
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:51,260
I was petting him all the
time, but he didn't bite me.

473
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:56,690
He became more beautiful.

474
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:10,875
May I bite you? Here you are.

475
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,950


476
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,671
I put a lot of food on your face.

477
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,270
You are a cat with a big belly.

478
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,131
You put a lot of food on your face.

479
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,450
Do I?

480
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,030
Yes.

481
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:39,030
I think it's a good idea to do that.

482
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:09,120
I'm sorry.

483
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,020
How do you feel?

484
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:40,270
You want it so much, don't you?

485
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:41,410
It's cold, isn't it?

486
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:43,350
It's cold, isn't it?

487
01:06:54,075 --> 01:06:59,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

488
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,280
I put my tongue out.

489
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,600
I put my tongue out here.

490
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:32,510
Does it feel good?

491
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:51,080
Do you want to
put it in? Massage.

492
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,780


493
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:47,180
It's hard, isn't it?

494
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,020
It's not the same as before.

495
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,000
It's much stronger than before.

496
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:29,920
This one is too strong.

497
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,940
No, no, no! Oh, it's sour.

498
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,110


499
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:36,800
If you keep breathing
like that, it will come out.

500
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,840
I didn't force you.

501
01:14:51,550 --> 01:15:01,360
Stop breathing. It will come out.

502
01:15:10,235 --> 01:15:11,770
No, it will come out.

503
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:24,820
This video was taken in August 2020.

504
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:25,821
Don't shake your hips.

505
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,900
I'm sorry.

506
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,260
Would you like to read this?

507
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,310
You read this? Wait, wait.

508
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,820


509
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,140
What is this? Wait, wait.

510
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,180
Ah! Ah, ah.

511
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,000
Ah, ah.

512
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:52,260


513
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,730


514
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,030
I'm sorry.

515
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:39,890
It doesn't feel good.

516
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,520
It doesn't feel good.

517
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,120
I was able to get a lot of sleep.

518
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:23,010
I was able to sleep well.

519
01:25:23,011 --> 01:25:23,170
I was able to sleep well.

520
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,950
I was able to sleep well.

521
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:58,410
I had been sick for a few days.

522
01:25:58,411 --> 01:26:00,251
But when I got back
to my room, I felt better.

523
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,900
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

524
01:26:38,155 --> 01:26:58,270
I hope you'll do well.

525
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:01,550
Are you okay?

526
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:34,720
I'm sorry about yesterday.

527
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:40,680
I was drunk and fell asleep.

528
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,560
I'm at home.

529
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,180
Okay, I'll see you later.

530
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,600
Good morning.

531
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,200
Good morning.

532
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,080
Hibiki...

533
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,040
Why did you choose me?

534
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,820
Why...

535
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:16,840
I have to go home.

536
01:36:14,785 --> 01:37:03,420
It's delicious, isn't it?

537
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:09,930
This is a video of me when I
was pregnant with my first child.

538
01:43:09,931 --> 01:43:09,950
I was pregnant with my first child.

539
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:10,050
I was pregnant with my first child.

540
01:43:10,051 --> 01:43:10,130
I was pregnant with my first child.

541
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:11,310
I was pregnant with my first child.

542
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:12,250
I was pregnant with my first child.

543
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,850
I was pregnant with my first child.

544
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,680
I'm sorry.

545
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,180
I'll do it.

546
01:43:34,181 --> 01:43:35,181
Don't you want to do it?

547
01:43:35,800 --> 01:44:10,800
I want to do it,
but... Then, you do it.

548
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:28,100
It's a bit gross.

549
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:41,510
That's not good.

550
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,940
It's gross.

551
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:56,940
It hurts.

552
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:03,180
I can't breathe.

553
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,010
I'm sorry.

554
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,140
Are you all right?

555
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:37,670
Hibiki, it's nothing.

556
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:50,260
Good luck in college.

557
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:17,060
Len.

558
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:21,200
Sukine-kun.
